 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  [**Last Name (un) 466**] out.  Hct slowly trending down.  No
   changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.  Q8hr hematocrits today.
   Patient now with two episodes of variceal bleeding within a two week
   period.  Over the past 24 hours she has required five units of packed
   red blood cells.  She is currently hemodynamically stable and her
   hematocrit is 37.3.  Her bleeding is complicated by mild acute renal
   failure with a creatinine of 1.5.  Upper endoscopy on [**2187-11-9**] showed
   multiple cords of grade 3 varices and significant portal hypertensive
   gastropathy.  Endoscopy today showed active variceal bleeding and
   intervention was unsucessful.  She currently has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube in
   place.
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - will remove PICC and left subclavian line
   - 6 units of PRBCs crossmatched
   - she is now s/p TIPS procedure for management of her portal
   hypertension as well as 7 liter paracentesis
   - will continue octreotide drip
   - continue pantoprazole drip
   - will give albumin 50 grams given large volume paracentesis
   - vancomycin and ceftazidime for SBP prophylaxis/coverage given fever
   this morning
   - Q4H hematocrit, platelet count, INR tonight
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.  Although her initial xray is a poor
   quality film, she does appear to have volume loss on the right side
   which may also be contributing.  This repeat episode of bleeding
   occurred immediately prior to planned tracheostomy.  Per notes she has
   had a previous episode of respiratory failure in the setting of being
   found unresponsive on [**2187-10-23**].  ABG now improved with large volume
   parcentesis.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now in the setting of acute
   variceal bleeding
   - will repeat ABG now and attempt to decrease FiO2
   - will increase respiratory rate for mild hypercarbia on ABG
   - propofol for sedation
   Fevers:  GPC in clusters and pairs.  Continue vanc and ceftaz.  Febrile
   again this morning.  cultures drawn.
   Patient was reportedly febrile to 101 degrees this morning at
   [**Hospital1 1241**]  She was ordered for vancomycin and ceftazidime but did not
   receive these medications.  Cultures during her OSH course appear to
   have been negative with the exception of a sputum positive for
   stenotrophomonas and a rectal swab positive for VRE.  This appears to
   be an isolated fever.
   - blood and urine cultures pending from here
   - will follow up cultures from [**Hospital1 1241**]
   - will need to consider diagnostic paracentesis in the AM
   - will send stool for c. diff
   - will send sputum cultures
   - broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and ceftazidime
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at 1.5 from baseline of 1.1 prior to
   this hospitalization.  Elevation is in the setting of acute GI
   bleeding.
   - IV hydration targeted towards urine ouptut, MAP > 65
   - will send urine electrolytes
   - will give albumin 50 grams now given large volume paracentesis and
   renal failure
   - will consider renal consult if worsening
   Hyperkalemia:  Occuring in the setting of renal failure and also
   receiving multiple blood products.  It is now trending down.
   - will hold on kaexylate for now but consider if potassium is riding
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - vancomycin and ceftazidime for empiric coverage of fevers, cultures
   pending
   - consider paracentesis in the AM
   - octreotide and pantoprazole drips for variceal bleeding
   - albumin 50 grams given large volume paracentesis
   - will need to remove [**Last Name (un) **] tube in the morning
   - as above, now s/p TIPS
   - holding lactulose given [**Last Name (un) **] in place
   Type II Diabetes:  Per notes has been requiring significant doses of
   insulin in her TPN as well as slidign scale. Given critical illness
   will use insulin drip for now.
   - insulin drip
   - calculate insulin needs over 24 hours
   Elevated troponin:  Troponin 0.10 in the setting of acute renal failure
   with flat CKs.  Unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given
   normal CKs.
   - EKG on arrival to the MICU
   - not a candidate for aspirin, plavix, heparin, beta blocker or statin
   in current medical condition
   - will trend cardiac enzymes
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.  Although her initial xray is a poor
   quality film, she does appear to have volume loss on the right side
   which may also be contributing.  This repeat episode of bleeding
   occurred immediately prior to planned tracheostomy.  Per notes she has
   had a previous episode of respiratory failure in the setting of being
   found unresponsive on [**2187-10-23**].  ABG now improved with large volume
   parcentesis.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has had two episodes of variceal bleeding within a two-week period, requiring five units of packed red blood cells. She is currently hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 37.3, but has mild acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.5. She has also been intubated since admission with difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a history of bacteremia, and the current cultures are pending. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and ceftazidime.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has mild acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.5, which is likely due to acute GI bleeding. She is receiving IV hydration and albumin to help manage her renal failure.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient is experiencing hyperkalemia, which is likely due to renal failure and receiving multiple blood products. She is being monitored closely, and kaexylate may be considered if her potassium levels continue to rise.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated since admission, and has difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. She may require a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning.
5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is at risk for delirium and confusion due to her underlying medical condition and the use of sedatives.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had two episodes of variceal bleeding within a two-week period, and is at risk for further bleeding.
7. End-Stage Liver Disease: The patient has cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, which increases her risk for further complications and mortality.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Maintaining active type and screen
* Removing PICC and left subclavian line
* Continuing octreotide and pantoprazole drips for variceal bleeding
* Giving albumin 50 grams given large volume paracentesis
* Monitoring blood and urine cultures pending from here
* Considering diagnostic paracentesis in the AM
* Sending stool for c. diff and sputum cultures
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and ceftazidime
* Monitoring for signs of worsening renal failure and considering a renal consult
* Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory failure and considering a tracheostomy
* Monitoring for signs of further gastrointestinal bleeding and considering further interventions
* Monitoring for signs of delirium and confusion and considering further interventions
* Monitoring for signs of end-stage liver disease and considering further interventions."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   - currently given lactulose PR, will give PO after dobhoff placement.
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation.
   - propofol for sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
   Febrile again this morning when cultures were drawn.  Given that we
   have found a probable source of fevers, we will continue vancomycin and
   narrow to ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Continue vancomycin.  If MSSA can change to nafcillin.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at 1.5 from baseline of 1.1 prior to
   this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology and Cr
   has continued very slightly.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital.
   Today we will try to convert to long-acting insulin and sliding scale.
   - calculate insulin needs over last 24 hours, convert half to
   long-acting and give half by standing doses Q6hrs.
   Elevated troponin:  Troponin 0.10 in the setting of acute renal failure
   with flat CKs.  Unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given
   normal CKs.  EKG did not show signs of ischemia.
   - not a candidate for aspirin, plavix, heparin, beta blocker or statin
   in current medical condition
   - will trend cardiac enzymes
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ.  Left arterial line pulled by patient this morning.
   Will replace as patient needs frequent ABGs and blood pressure

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   - currently given lactulose PR, will give PO after dobhoff placement.
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation.
   - propofol for sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime.
   Febrile again this morning when cultures were drawn.  Given that we
   have found a probable source of fevers, we will continue vancomycin and
   narrow to ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Continue vancomycin.  If MSSA can change to nafcillin.
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at 1.5 from baseline of 1.1 prior to
   this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology and Cr
   has continued very slightly.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital.
   Today we will try to convert to long-acting insulin and sliding scale.
   - calculate insulin needs over last 24 hours, convert half to
   long-acting and give half by standing doses Q6hrs.
   Elevated troponin:  Troponin 0.10 in the setting of acute renal failure
   with flat CKs.  Unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given
   normal CKs.  EKG did not show signs of ischemia.
   - not a candidate for aspirin, plavix, heparin, beta blocker or statin
   in current medical condition
   - will trend cardiac enzymes
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ.  Left arterial line pulled by patient this morning.
   Will replace as patient needs frequent ABGs and blood pressure
   monitoring.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse, who is currently admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. The patient has undergone a TIPS procedure and has a 12F triple lumen catheter in place in the right internal jugular vein.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in clusters, and is currently receiving vancomycin and ceftazidime.
2. Cirrhosis/End-Stage Liver Disease: The patient has a MELD score of 21 and has recurrent variceal bleeding.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated since November 9th and has difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.5, and urine output has been good.
5. Type II Diabetes: The patient has been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital and will be converted to long-acting insulin and sliding scale.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient has a troponin level of 0.10, which is unlikely to represent acute coronary syndrome given normal CKs.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further bleeding from the varices: The patient's liver disease and portal hypertension may lead to further bleeding from the varices.
2. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and positive blood culture may lead to further infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalance and acidosis.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's type II diabetes may lead to hyperglycemia, which may require further management.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin level may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Maintenance of the 12F triple lumen catheter in the right internal jugular vein.
2. Vancomycin and ceftazidime for bacteremia.
3. Octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding.
4. Lactulose PR, with plans to convert to PO after dobhoff placement.
5. Insulin therapy for type II diabetes.
6. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes to rule out cardiac complications.

The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has requested aggressive care. The patient's disposition is pending improvement in her mental and respiratory statuses."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed already.
   While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of acute
   bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen, rescreen today
   - has 7U PRBC's crossmatched. Will need to cancel them for today
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting lactulose and rifaxamin by
   Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 21.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   - Vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   - Wean PEEP today from 18 to 15
   - Watch O2 sats
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need trach but will try to wean to better PEEPs
    Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but
   switched to Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  Febrile to 100.7 yesterday 8pm.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 4 Vanc and day 2 Ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   - Will give 500cc's D5 this am with potassium and f/u Cr this pm
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin.
   - Currently on Glargine 25 qhs and SSI
   - Watch BS's and adjust accordingly, have been in the 100's through
   yesterday
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.6
   through LOS and was negative through yesterday
   - Will replace K this am with 500cc D5W
   - Start free H20 flushes through feeding tube
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - liver recs: Keep ceftriaxone for SBP will get back to us today re NGT
   - if NGT, nutrition c/s for TF
   - From [**Hospital1 1910**] (liver): Patient was listed for transplant at [**Hospital1 1910**],
   actually active on the transplant list as they had not heard of her
   most recent hospitalization, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] believes that they would like
   her back to transplant her. They will call when an ICU bed is
   available...
   - Had frothy fluid from ETT, suctioned, O2 sats in low 90s, PEEP of 18,
   given Lasix 20mg, 20mg, CXR with pulm edema

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has been intubated since November 9th due to respiratory failure, which is unclear in etiology but was initially thought to be secondary to ARDS. She has also been diagnosed with bacteremia, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. She is currently receiving treatment for variceal bleeding, bacteremia, and type II diabetes, and is being worked up for liver transplant.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and weaning from the ventilator is difficult due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and the need for tracheostomy.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture, and there is a risk of sepsis and organ failure if the infection is not effectively treated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is trending downward, but there is still a risk of further renal deterioration and the need for dialysis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to poor fluid intake, and there is a risk of further electrolyte imbalances if not addressed.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and there is a risk of further liver deterioration and the need for liver transplant.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of recurrent variceal bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding and the need for further treatment.
7. Delirium: The patient is significantly altered and likely has encephalopathy, which may worsen if not addressed.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient is not receiving adequate nutrition, and there is a risk of further malnutrition and the need for nutritional support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for variceal bleeding, bacteremia, and type II diabetes.
2. Wean the patient from the ventilator gradually, and consider tracheostomy if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Address the patient's hypernatremia with fluid replacement and electrolyte management.
5. Continue to work up the patient for liver transplant.
6. Consider the use of lactulose and rifaxamin to manage the patient's encephalopathy.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status closely and consider nutritional support if necessary.
8. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to manage the patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen, rescreen today
   - has 7U PRBC's crossmatched. Will need to cancel them for today
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation, will try a spontaneous breath trial today
   - Will need new tube as there appears to be a cuff leak
   - now off sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Pulm edema: seen on CXR with frothy liquid coming from ETT
   - keep negative for today: will give 20mg Lasix today and monitor UOP
    Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but
   switched to Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  Febrile to 100.7 yesterday 8pm.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 4 Vanc and day 2 Ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   - Will give 500cc's D5 this am with potassium and f/u Cr this pm
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin.
   - Currently on Glargine 25 qhs and SSI
   - Watch BS's and adjust accordingly, have been in the 100's through
   yesterday
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.6
   through LOS and was negative through yesterday
   - Will replace K this am with 500cc D5W
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed yesterday by
   radiology.  While her Hct is slowly trending down there are no signs of
   acute bleed.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
   - maintain active type and screen, rescreen today
   - has 7U PRBC's crossmatched. Will need to cancel them for today
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C and
   alcohol abuse.  She is now off of sedation and remains significantly
   altered likely from encephalopathy.  Ideally we need to be able to give
   PO lactulose and rifaximin.  We will attempt a dobhoff placement
   today.  Current MELD score is 21.  She has recurrent variceal
   bleeding.  The remainder of her history is unclear at this time.  Per
   secretary at hepatology office, she was on the transplant list, but we
   need further clarification.
   - liver team following.  Will discuss dobhoff placement with them.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   - vancomycin for bacteremia.
   - octreotide drip and pantoprazole IV for variceal bleeding
   Respiratory Failure:  CXR has worsening patchy infiltrates today.
   Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**] with difficulty weaning
   secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.  The etiology of her
   respiratory failure is unclear but was initially felt to be secondary
   to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes of blood.  Her
   respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant ascites and
   small lung volumes.
   - continue assist control ventilation for now given difficult
   oxygenation, will try a spontaneous breath trial today
   - Will need new tube as there appears to be a cuff leak
   - now off sedation
   - no indication for trach at this time, especially as she has difficult
   access.
   Pulm edema: seen on CXR with frothy liquid coming from ETT
   - keep negative for today: will give 20mg Lasix today and monitor UOP
    Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**] bottles.
   At OSH grew what appears to be staph aureus on [**3-21**] bottles with
   sensitivities pending.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but
   switched to Vanc and Ceftriaxone.  Febrile to 100.7 yesterday 8pm.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 4 Vanc and day 2 Ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to prevent peritoneal pressures obstructing
   renal perfusion.
   - Fluid repletion should happen via feeds.  We will try to place a
   dobhoff today to allow for POs.
   - Will give 500cc's D5 this am with potassium and f/u Cr this pm
   Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin.
   - Currently on Glargine 25 qhs and SSI
   - Watch BS's and adjust accordingly, have been in the 100's through
   yesterday
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.6
   through LOS and was negative through yesterday
   - Will replace K this am with 500cc D5W
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She underwent a TIPS procedure and has been intubated since November 9th due to respiratory failure. She has been febrile, with cultures growing GPC and staph aureus, and has been treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5, and she has been receiving fluids and insulin for type II diabetes. She has a MELD score of 21 and is considered a candidate for liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she requires assist control ventilation. She has a cuff leak in her endotracheal tube, which needs to be addressed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and is receiving antibiotics, but she is still at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has been receiving fluids and insulin for type II diabetes. She is at risk for developing acute kidney injury.
4. Liver failure: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for developing liver failure. She is a candidate for liver transplant and needs to be closely monitored.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and is at risk for developing an infection.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has a negative fluid balance and is at risk for developing hypernatremia.
8. Hypokalemia: The patient has been receiving potassium supplements, but she is at risk for developing hypokalemia due to her negative fluid balance.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to administer antibiotics for her positive blood culture and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid and insulin therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust her therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her therapy as needed.
8. Consider placing a Dobhoff tube to allow for enteral nutrition and to help with fluid management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen,
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - Q8hr hematocrits today.
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - continue octreotide drip.
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean to 10 today.
   - Watch O2 sats
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need trach but will try to wean to better PEEPs
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - ID consult given positive culture.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 38 qhs.
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat lytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred from another hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has a triple-lumen catheter in her right internal jugular vein.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has acute respiratory failure, intubated since November 9, with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. PEEP is currently at 12, and the patient is tolerating it well.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 135/55 mmHg, and her heart rate is 83 beats per minute. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.1 mg/dL. Her urine output has been good, and her FENa is consistent with a prerenal etiology.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has cirrhosis, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending upward. She has been receiving lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy.
* Endocrine: The patient has type II diabetes, and her blood sugars have been in the 200s. She is currently receiving subcutaneous insulin.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 91,000/μL. She has been receiving octreotide for bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is not weaned off the ventilator or if her PEEP and FiO2 requirements increase.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if she does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation or if her creatinine level increases.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and cirrhosis may increase her risk of bleeding, especially if she requires surgical intervention.
* Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and recent antibiotic therapy may increase her risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.
* Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen her encephalopathy, leading to increased confusion and altered mental status.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen if she does not receive adequate fluid resuscitation or if her sodium level increases.
* DVT: The patient's immobilization and risk factors for DVT may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and hematological conditions are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen,
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - d/c octreotide drip per liver recs
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 50qhs
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 will f/u their recs
   - maintain active type and screen,
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   - d/c octreotide drip per liver recs
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 50qhs
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.
   Code:  Full (discussed with  HCP)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - d/c octreotide drip per liver recs
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**] be cholestasis
   secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 12, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone.
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Will continue Vanc and Ceftriaxone per liver recs
   - Now day 5 Vanc and day 3 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward.  Urine output has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Currently on Glargine 30 qhs and SSI
   - Increase glargine to 50qhs
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: Albumin 50 grams post paracentesis, replete electrolytes, has now
   started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding. She has undergone a TIPS procedure and has a 12F triple-lumen access in her right internal jugular vein.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is intubated and has been on mechanical ventilation since November 9th. Her PEEP is currently set at 12 cmH2O, and she is tolerating it well. Her FiO2 is 50%, and her SpO2 is 99%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2 of 198 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: Her blood pressure is 135/55 mmHg, and her heart rate is 83 beats per minute. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 19 mmHg.
* Neurological: She is significantly altered and likely has encephalopathy.
* Gastrointestinal: She has been on lactulose and rifaximin for management of ascites and encephalopathy.
* Renal: Her creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and her urine output has been good.
* Hematological: She has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 91,000/μL.
* Endocrine: She has type II diabetes and has been started on subcutaneous insulin.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: She is at risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying liver disease, ascites, and small lung volumes.
* Sepsis: She has a history of bacteremia and is currently on vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
* Renal failure: She has acute kidney injury and is at risk of worsening kidney function.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: She has a history of variceal bleeding and is at risk of further bleeding.
* Encephalopathy: She is significantly altered and may have worsening encephalopathy.
* Thrombocytopenia: She has thrombocytopenia and is at risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing to manage her respiratory failure with PEEP and FiO2 as needed.
* Monitoring her blood sugar levels and adjusting her insulin regimen as necessary.
* Continuing to manage her ascites with lactulose and rifaximin.
* Monitoring her renal function and adjusting her fluid management as necessary.
* Continuing to monitor her platelet count and adjusting her platelet transfusions as necessary.
* Preparing her for transfer to [**Hospital1 1910**] for further liver transplant evaluation on Monday."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 octreotide gtt stopped
   - maintain active type and screen currently outdate [**2187-11-27**]
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST now down after trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**]
   be cholestasis secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 8, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Now day 6 Vanc and day 4 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward and is now normal.  Urine output
   has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Increased last night to Glargine 50 qhs
   - Continue ISS
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: replete electrolytes, has now started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 60-year-old female, is being treated for recurrent variceal bleeding, cirrhosis of the liver, type II diabetes, and acute respiratory failure. She has a history of hepatitis C and alcohol abuse. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for management of her condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 120/47 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient has been intubated since November 9th and has been experiencing difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. Her respiratory mechanics are affected by significant ascites and small lung volumes. PEEP has been decreased to 8 cmH2O, and the patient is tolerating it well.

The patient has a diagnosis of bacteremia, with cultures growing GPC in clusters and pairs, and Staph Epidermis in one bottle. She has been treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime, but switched to vanc and ceftriaxone due to sensitivity issues.

The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL at admission and a baseline of 1.1 mg/dL prior to hospitalization. Her urine output has been good, and her FENa is consistent with a prerenal etiology.

The patient has type II diabetes, with blood sugars in the 200s. She has been started on subQ insulin and is being monitored closely.

The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to poor fluid intake, and is being treated with free water flushes. Her electrolytes are being monitored regularly.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 99 x 10^9/L. Her platelet count is trending down, and she is being monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying cirrhosis and ascites.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if her underlying condition is not managed properly.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding if not managed properly.
6. Diabetes complications: The patient's type II diabetes may lead to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy if not managed properly.
7. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to liver failure if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her PEEP and FiO2 levels as needed.
2. Continue to treat her bacteremia with vanc and ceftriaxone, and monitor her response to treatment.
3. Continue to manage her acute renal failure with fluid restriction and electrolyte monitoring.
4. Continue to monitor her hypernatremia and adjust her fluid intake accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor her thrombocytopenia and adjust her platelet count as needed.
6. Continue to manage her type II diabetes with insulin and monitor her blood sugars closely.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her treatment plan as needed.

I also recommend that the patient be transferred to a liver transplant center for further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 140 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's 24-hour events include a sputum culture, which showed possible transfer to another hospital on Monday, but no beds were available. The patient's liver function tests are stable, with slightly improved hypernatremia. The patient's Humalog dose has been increased to 50 qhs, and PEEP has been reduced to 8 cm/H20. The patient has a history of allergies to lisinopril and unknown substances. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including ceftazidime, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 120/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, but soft and non-tender to palpation. The patient's skin is not assessed, but there are chronic venous changes in the lower extremities. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 99 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with a bilirubin level of 312 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 225 IU/L. The patient's blood glucose level is 134 mg/dL.

The patient's microbiology results show that the sputum culture grew 3+ GNR's, and the patient's blood culture is negative for bacteria and viruses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of falls, injury, and mortality.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if not managed properly, leading to hemorrhagic shock and organ failure.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to coma and death.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may worsen if not managed properly, leading to coma and death.
7. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to organ failure and mortality.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and mortality.

Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan: 60 year old female with a history of hepatitis C
   cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse who is transferred from
   [**Hospital 1241**] hospital for management of recurrent variceal bleeding.
   #Variceal Bleeding:  s/p TIPS procedure.  [**Last Name (un) 466**] removed. HCT
   stable.  No changes for now.  Access is 12 F triple lumen.
   - Plan is to transfer her to [**Hospital1 1910**] where she is known to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9171**] and
   she was being worked up for transplant
   - appreciate liver consult
 octreotide gtt stopped
   - maintain active type and screen currently outdate [**2187-11-27**]
   - 12 F triple lumen in place in right IJ
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - pantoprazole to 40mg IV BID
   #Cirrhosis/End Stage Liver Disease:  Secondary to hepatitis C, alcohol
   abuse and NASH.  HCV viral load 12,500 . She is now off of sedation and
   remains significantly altered likely from encephalopathy.  Getting
   lactulose and rifaxamin by Dobhoff.  Current MELD score is 16. ALT and
   AST now down after trending upward. Alk phos also acutely elevated. [**Month (only) 11**]
   be cholestasis secondary to NPO given patient was NPO for sig time.
   - treatment of variceal bleeding as above
   - now getting PO Rifaxamin and Lactulose
   #Respiratory Failure:  Patient has now been intubated since [**2187-11-9**]
   with difficulty weaning secondary to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements.
   The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear but was initially
   felt to be secondary to ARDS in the setting of aspirating large volumes
   of blood.  Her respiratory mechanics are also affected by significant
   ascites and small lung volumes.
   -PEEP currently at 8, tolerating well, will try to wean today as
   tolerated
   - Watch O2 sats
   - ABG to assess weaning
   # Fevers:  Cultures grew GPC in clusters and pairs here on [**2-19**]
   bottles.  At OSH grew Staph Epidermis 3/4 bottles with sensitivity only
   to vancomycin.  Has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime but switched to
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone
   - Has already had ECHO while bacteremic without signs of vegetations.
   - Now day 6 Vanc and day 4 Ceftriaxone
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine at admission 1.5 from baseline of 1.1
   prior to this hospitalization.  FENa consistent with prerenal etiology
   and Cr has continued to trend downward and is now normal.  Urine output
   has been good.
   #Type II Diabetes:  Had been on an insulin gtt at the outside hospital
   and here but have now started subQ insulin. Blood sugars in 200s.
   - Increased last night to Glargine 50 qhs
   - Continue ISS
   -Hypernatremia: Likely from poor fluid intake as she is negative 2.3
   through LOS. Improving with free water flushes.
   -Continue free water flushes 250ml q4 hours
   - repeat electrolytes this pm and f/u
   #Thrombocytopenia: Patient continues to trend down. Per notes from OSH,
   patient appears to usually be around 100.
   -Continue to monitor
   #FEN: replete electrolytes, has now started tube feeds through Dobhoff
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: Right IJ. R art line.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and alcohol abuse. She was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent variceal bleeding, and has undergone a TIPS procedure. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and has been for 17 days. She has difficulty weaning due to high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. Her respiratory mechanics are affected by significant ascites and small lung volumes. PEEP is currently at 8 cmH2O, and the plan is to try to wean today as tolerated.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a systolic murmur and her blood pressure is 120/47 mmHg.
* Neurological status: The patient is significantly altered and likely has encephalopathy. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and has undergone a TIPS procedure. She is receiving pantoprazole and is being monitored for bleeding.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, but her creatinine has trended downward and is now normal. She is receiving fluids and electrolyte replacement.
* Endocrine status: The patient has type II diabetes and is receiving insulin.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 99.
* Infectious status: The patient has a positive sputum culture for GNR, and has been treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime. She also has a history of bacteremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further intervention to wean her off the ventilator.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia and is at risk for developing sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.
* Encephalopathy: The patient is significantly altered and may require further management to improve her neurological status.
* Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and may require further intervention to manage her kidney function.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may require further management to prevent bleeding.

The patient's current medications include:

* Insulin
* Pantoprazole
* Lactulose
* Rifaximin
* Vancomycin
* Ceftazidime
* Ceftriaxone
* Octreotide

The patient's current laboratory results include:

* WBC: 7.1
* Hct: 28.5
* Plt: 99
* Cr: 1.3
* TCO2: 28
* Glucose: 134
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 16.9/26.5/1.5, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 45/2/0.10, ALT / AST: 46/78, Alk Phos / T Bili: 225/2.8, Differential-Neuts: 81.4 %, Lymph: 8.8 %, Mono: 5.3 %, Eos: 3.4 %, Fibrinogen: 320 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, LDH: 417 IU/L, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Transfer to [**Hospital1 1910**] for further liver transplant evaluation on Monday
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust PEEP and FiO2 as needed
* Continue to manage the patient's bleeding and encephalopathy
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels
* Continue to manage the patient's thrombocytopenia
* Continue to monitor the patient's infectious status and adjust antibiotics as needed."
