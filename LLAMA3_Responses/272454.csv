   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   .
   1)  Drug Intoxication/Bradycardia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2367**] presented with SI,
   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is
   unclear at this time as to the amounts he ingested today.  ECG was also
   reviewed and QT interval seems normal, although bradycardic.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial ECGs
   - Transcutaneous pacer pads in place
   - Mg PRN torsades
   - Hold Methadone, Klonapin, Quetiapine
   .
   2) Hypertension:  Patient with history of malignant HTN, usually in
   setting of non-compliance with Clonidine patch.  Patient without patch
   on arrival to floor today, hypertensive to SBP 190s.
   - restart Clonidine patch
   - hold oral meds till less somnolent
   - PRN Hydralazine with goal SBP 160s
   - likely restart Amlodipine, HCTZ in AM
   .
   3) PE s/p IVC filter: No issues currently.  Patient with c/o blood
   tinged sputum since PE, no cough on arrival.  Will monitor.  HCT
   stable.
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   4)  COPD
 cont home tiotropium.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism, who presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient has a history of heroin abuse and was taking methadone maintenance. He has also attempted to smuggle Klonapin on his previous admission and was found to be hiding Klonapin and Clonidine bottles in his underwear. The patient's current bradycardia is likely due to an overdose of opioids, benzodiazepines, and methadone. He has been given 10mg of Hydralazine to control his blood pressure, which has improved from 210/100 to 190s/90.

Potential medical complications:

1. Torsades de pointes: The patient's bradycardia and overdose of benzodiazepines and opioids may increase the risk of torsades de pointes, a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory depression: The patient's overdose of opioids and benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression, which may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of malignant hypertension and current hypertension may increase the risk of a hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiac complications.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism may increase the risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: The patient's history of heroin abuse and current overdose may increase the risk of infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's overdose may cause gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
8. Psychiatric complications: The patient's history of depression and suicidal ideation may increase the risk of psychiatric complications, particularly depression and anxiety.
9. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient's overdose may cause withdrawal symptoms, particularly opioid withdrawal, which can lead to a range of symptoms including anxiety, agitation, and seizures."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.
   - Will D/C lisinopril as pt refusing to take it
   - Will need to figure out a reasonable home regimen that he will take
   and that he will not be able to OD on

   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism, who presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic.
* The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for drug intoxication and bradycardia.
* The patient has been found to be hiding clonidine and Klonapin bottles in his underwear, and has attempted to smuggle Klonapin on his previous admission.
* The patient's current bradycardia is likely due to an overdose of clonidine, which he has been taking illicitly.
* The patient's blood pressure is currently hypotensive, and his heart rate is in the 60s.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Torsades de pointes due to clonidine overdose
* Bradycardia and hypotension
* Rebound hypertension due to cessation of clonidine
* Opiate/benzo withdrawal
* Suicidal ideation and behavior
* Non-compliance with medical treatment
* Infection due to poor wound care
* Pneumonia due to COPD exacerbation
* DVT and PE due to poor anticoagulation

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of clonidine overdose, including bradycardia and hypotension.
* The patient's clonidine patch will be decreased to 0.1mg to prevent rebound hypertension.
* The patient will be held on methadone, Klonapin, and Quetiapine due to concerns about overdose and non-compliance.
* The patient will be evaluated for capacity and suicidality by a psychiatrist.
* The patient's home dose of methadone will be confirmed.
* The patient will be restarted on amlodipine and HCTZ, and will be monitored for signs of hypertension.
* The patient's COPD will be managed with tiotropium and albuterol nebs PRN.
* The patient will be monitored for signs of DVT and PE, and will be restarted on SQ heparin.
* The patient's anxiety and depression will be managed with Cymbalta and psych consulting.
* The patient will be NPO for now, and will be replete with electrolytes as needed.
* The patient's code status is full code.
* The patient's disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.
   - Will D/C lisinopril as pt refusing to take it
   - Will need to figure out a reasonable home regimen that he will take
   and that he will not be able to OD on
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take
   #. FEN: Fluid bolus because of hypotension. Regular diet. Replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   #. PPx: D/C PPI as tolerating reg diet. SC Heparin DVT prophylaxis.
   #. Access: Peripheral IV in L foot
   #. Communication: With patient
   #. Dispo: Need psych to eval whether capable of making medical
   decisions then will eval whether patient can leave AMA as he wants to
   or whether he needs to be committed to the hospital.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He was diagnosed with drug intoxication and bradycardia. Further evaluation revealed that he had smuggled clonidine into his room and was overdosing on it, causing hypotension and tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 37 bpm (36-53 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 189/87 mmHg (110/79-196/100 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 9 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: sinus bradycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 29.6%
* Platelet count: 200 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL
* Other labs: ALT/AST: 16/21, Alk Phos/T Bili: 94/0.5, Ca++: 9.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Wheezing in the lungs
* Sitting in a chair in no acute distress

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Holding methadone, klonipin, and seroquel due to their potential for street value and abuse
* Decreasing the clonidine patch dose to 0.1mg to prevent rebound hypertension
* Continuing the patient on a regular diet and repleting electrolytes as needed
* Evaluating the patient's capacity to make medical decisions and determining whether he can leave the hospital against medical advice (AMA) or needs to be committed to the hospital.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Rebound hypertension due to the decrease in clonidine patch dose
* Hypotension due to the patient's continued use of clonidine
* Bradycardia due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and medication use
* Respiratory complications due to the patient's COPD and wheezing in the lungs
* Electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's medication use and fluid boluses
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and lack of adequate nutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   .
   1)  Drug Intoxication/Bradycardia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2367**] presented with SI,
   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is
   unclear at this time as to the amounts he ingested today.  ECG was also
   reviewed and QT interval seems normal, although bradycardic.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Serial ECGs
   - Transcutaneous pacer pads in place
   - Mg PRN torsades
   - Hold Methadone, Klonapin, Quetiapine
   - Tox team consulting
   .
   2) Hypertension:  Patient with history of malignant HTN, usually in
   setting of non-compliance with Clonidine patch.  Patient without patch
   on arrival to floor today, hypertensive to SBP 190s.
   - restart Clonidine patch
   - hold oral meds till less somnolent
   - PRN Hydralazine with goal SBP 160s
   - likely restart Amlodipine, HCTZ in AM
   .
   3) PE s/p IVC filter: No issues currently.  Patient with c/o blood
   tinged sputum since PE, no cough on arrival.  Will monitor.  HCT
   stable.
   - Heparin SQ
   .
   4)  COPD
 cont home tiotropium.
   - Albuterol nebs PRN
   .
   5) Anxiety/Depression:  Patient c/o SI on arrival to ED, but denied SI
   on arrival to MICU.  Will hold Quetiapine.
   - cont Cymbalta
   - Psych consulting

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   .
   1)  Drug Intoxication/Bradycardia:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2367**] presented with SI,
   also noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.  He had a similar episode
   one month ago where he was admitted after being found down, and also
   found to be bradycardic and intoxicated.  Bradycardia at that time
   presumed to be [**2-25**] to opiate/benzo overdose.  Patient presents
   similarly today.  On floor he was found to be hiding Klonapin and
   Clonidine bottles in his underwear.  He also attempted to smuggle
   Klonapin on his last admission.  It seems likely that his current
   bradycardia is also due to Opiate/Benzo/Methadone overdose.  It is
   unclear at this time as to the amounts he ingested today.  ECG was also
   reviewed and QT interval seems normal, although bradycardic.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism who presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He was admitted to the ICU for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient has a history of heroin abuse and is on methadone maintenance. He has been experiencing hypertension and bradycardia, and has been treated with hydralazine and lorazepam.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 189/87 mmHg, heart rate of 37 bpm, and respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97%, and he is receiving supplemental oxygen. His physical examination is notable for a normal neurologic examination, but he is unable to assess his peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic examinations due to his somnolent state.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. His blood cultures are negative, and his urinalysis shows no abnormalities. His electrocardiogram shows a normal QT interval, but his bradycardia is concerning.

The patient's medications include hydralazine, lorazepam, and methadone, which are being held due to his overdose. He is also receiving antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slow, and his oxygen saturation is normal. However, his respiratory status should be closely monitored to ensure that he does not develop respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia is concerning, and he should be closely monitored for cardiac arrhythmias. His QT interval is normal, but his bradycardia is still a concern.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a history of venous thromboembolism. He should be closely monitored for signs of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, and he has a history of venous thromboembolism. He should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding.
5. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient is on methadone maintenance, and he may experience withdrawal symptoms if he is not receiving adequate treatment. He should be closely monitored for signs of withdrawal symptoms.
6. Hypertension: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension, and he should be closely monitored for signs of hypertension.
7. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is concerning, and he should be closely monitored for signs of bradycardia."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism, who presented to the emergency department with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. He has a history of heroin abuse and is on methadone maintenance. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for drug intoxication and bradycardia. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypertension, which is likely related to non-compliance with his Clonidine patch, and bradycardia, which is suspected to be due to an opiate/benzo/methadone overdose. He also has a history of COPD and is taking medications for anxiety and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's bradycardia and hypertension increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and potential respiratory depression from the opiate/benzo/methadone overdose increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's history of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and potential hypotension from the opiate/benzo/methadone overdose increase the risk of renal failure.
6. Infection: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolism increase the risk of infection.
7. Stroke: The patient's bradycardia and hypertension increase the risk of stroke.
8. Seizures: The patient's history of opiate/benzo/methadone overdose and potential withdrawal increase the risk of seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider placement of a temporary pacemaker if necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications and monitor for signs of hypotension.
3. Continue to manage the patient's COPD with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Consider placement of a central venous catheter for administration of anticoagulation therapy.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider placement of a urinary catheter if necessary.

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism, was admitted to the ICU for drug intoxication and bradycardia. He has been taking methadone for heroin abuse and was found to have smuggled clonidine into the room, causing him to be hypotensive and bradycardic. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 126/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 63 bpm. He has a history of labile blood pressures and orthostatic changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of malignant hypertension and labile blood pressures increases the risk of a hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiac complications.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia, which is not responding to treatment, may be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as a cardiac conduction abnormality.
3. Methadone toxicity: The patient's high dose of methadone may be causing toxicity, which can lead to respiratory depression, coma, and even death.
4. Clonidine withdrawal: The patient's clonidine patch is being decreased to 0.1mg, which may cause withdrawal symptoms, including hypertension, tachycardia, and anxiety.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism increases the risk of a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 95%. He may be at risk for respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and bradycardia increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Consider consulting a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiac status and recommend further treatment.
4. Consider consulting a pulmonologist to evaluate the patient's respiratory status and recommend further treatment.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider increasing the patient's dose of methadone to manage his withdrawal symptoms.
7. Consider using a beta blocker to manage the patient's hypertension and bradycardia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of severe, radiating pain in the left arm. The patient's vital signs are stable, with hypertension and bradycardia noted. The patient has a history of hypertension, bradycardia, and unknown allergies to Compazine, Codeine, and Atenolol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the new onset of severe pain in the left arm.

The patient has received hydralazine and methadone for pain management, with a second dose of 20 mg methadone given at midnight. The patient's laboratory results show stable hemodynamics, with a slight decrease in white blood cell count and platelet count. The patient's troponin-T level is <0.01, indicating no evidence of cardiac injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and renal failure.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is slow, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrest, decreased cardiac output, and decreased blood flow to vital organs.
3. Pain management: The patient's severe pain in the left arm may not be adequately managed, leading to discomfort, anxiety, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Methadone toxicity: The patient has received a high dose of methadone, which can lead to respiratory depression, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.
5. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient is at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms, such as tremors, sweating, and anxiety, due to the discontinuation of methadone.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections, due to the presence of indwelling catheters and the patient's compromised immune system.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and the presence of indwelling catheters.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia due to the presence of a ventilator and the patient's compromised immune system."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 60 year old male with PMH significant for malignant HTN,
   Venous Thromboembolism and PE s/p IVC filter, history of heroin abuse
   on methadone maintenance who presented to ED initially complaining of
   suicidal ideation and was noted to be somnolent and bradycardic.
   Admitted for drug intoxication, bradycardia.
   . #. Intoxication/OD: Now seems to have been continuously overdosing on
   Clonidine he has smuggled into room causing him to be hypotensive and
   HR to increase to 60s from high 30s.
   - 500mL NS bolus for hypotension
   - Does better when lying down so will keep in bed for now.
   - Call security and have room searched.
   - Hold methadone, klonipin, seroquel as apparently have street value
   and can get high by taking combo
   - F/U tox recs
   - Have psych eval for capacity and suicidality
   - Confirm home dose of methadone
   - Patient refused to have clonidine patch removed but will decrease
   dose to 0.1mg if he allows us so that he will not have rebound HTN but
   since we believe he has also been taking clonidine on the side this
   will keep him from getting excessive clonidine.
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive because of clonidine OD most likely.
   - Decreased clonidine patch
   - Holding amlodipine and HCTZ for now.
   - Will D/C lisinopril as pt refusing to take it
   - Will need to figure out a reasonable home regimen that he will take
   and that he will not be able to OD on
   #. PE s/p filter on SQ Heparin PPx
   #. COPD: On tiotropium and albuterol PRN but refusing to take
   #. FEN: Fluid bolus because of hypotension. Regular diet. Replete
   electrolytes as needed.
   #. PPx: D/C PPI as tolerating reg diet. SC Heparin DVT prophylaxis.
   #. Access: Peripheral IV in L foot
   #. Communication: With patient
   #. Dispo: Need psych to eval whether capable of making medical
   decisions then will eval whether patient can leave AMA as he wants to
   or whether he needs to be committed to the hospital.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU for drug intoxication and bradycardia. He has been found to be continuously overdosing on clonidine, which he smuggled into the room. He is currently hypotensive and bradycardic. The patient is refusing to take lisinopril and is not taking his prescribed COPD medications. He is also refusing to have his clonidine patch removed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of malignant hypertension and current hypotensive state due to clonidine overdose increases the risk of a hypertensive crisis.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion of vital organs.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and refusal to take prescribed medications increases the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of venous thromboembolism and current anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and current anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: The patient's IV access and lack of wound care increase the risk of infection.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia can lead to electrolyte imbalance.
8. Rebound hypertension: The patient's clonidine overdose and refusal to have the patch removed increase the risk of rebound hypertension.
9. Suicidal ideation: The patient's history of suicidal ideation and current mental health status increase the risk of suicidal behavior.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
2. Administer fluids and electrolytes as needed to manage hypotension and electrolyte imbalance.
3. Consider consulting a cardiologist to manage the patient's hypertension and bradycardia.
4. Consult with a pulmonologist to manage the patient's COPD and respiratory status.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's IV access and wound care.
6. Consider consulting a psychiatrist to evaluate the patient's mental health status and suicidal ideation.
7. Develop a plan for the patient's discharge, including coordination with the patient's primary care physician and mental health provider."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a complex medical history, including malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU for drug intoxication and bradycardia.

The patient's current condition is complicated by clonidine overdose, which has caused hypotension and tachycardia. He has been taking clonidine without a prescription and has also smuggled it into the hospital room. The patient has refused to have the clonidine patch removed, but the medical team has decreased the dose to 0.1mg to prevent rebound hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 63 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 126/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 29.6%
* Platelet count: 200 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Malignant hypertension
* Venous thromboembolism
* Pulmonary embolism
* COPD
* FEN (fluid and electrolyte imbalance)
* DVT (deep vein thrombosis) prophylaxis
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Rebound hypertension due to clonidine withdrawal
* Bradycardia and hypotension due to clonidine overdose
* Respiratory failure due to COPD and fluid imbalance
* Infection due to VAP prophylaxis
* Bleeding due to decreased platelet count
* Renal failure due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding methadone, klonipin, and seroquel due to their potential for abuse
* Decreasing the dose of clonidine patch to 0.1mg
* F/U tox recs for clonidine overdose
* Psych eval for capacity and suicidality
* Confirming home dose of methadone
* Figuring out a reasonable home regimen that the patient will take and that will not allow him to overdose on clonidine."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an ICU admission with a chief complaint of overdose on clonidine, klonipin, and seroquel. The patient has been receiving methadone for withdrawal symptoms and has been somnolent with stable vital signs.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.8-4.3 K/uL
* Hct: 29.6-34.0%
* Plt: 200-215 K/uL
* Cr: 1.2-1.4 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 42-47 bpm, blood pressure of 141/74-183/95 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient has a history of allergies to Compazine (Injection), Codeine, and Atenolol, with a known bradycardia reaction to Atenolol.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their somnolent state, with no assessments performed on their peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other systems.

The patient's flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, with no significant changes in their hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, or respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory depression: The patient's somnolent state and respiratory rate of 13-13 inspirations per minute may indicate respiratory depression.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but it may drop further due to their medications and underlying condition.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has a history of bradycardia with Atenolol, and their current heart rate is within the normal range, but may drop further.
4. Infection: The patient's WBC count is within normal limits, but it may indicate an underlying infection.
5. Organ damage: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and troponin-T, which may indicate organ damage.
6. Withdrawal symptoms: The patient is receiving methadone for withdrawal symptoms, and may experience withdrawal symptoms if the medication is discontinued or reduced.
7. Delirium: The patient's somnolent state and altered mental status may indicate delirium, which can be a complication of ICU care.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is not specified."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: O/D on clonidine, klonipin, seroquel most likely.
   24 Hour Events:
   Psych says is not suicidal. S/W confirmed that pt has nowhere to go
   home to as normally just sleeps on a bench. Got 135mg methadone in the
   morning and remained somnolent all day with HR and BPs stable at 30s
   and 150s/70s respectively.
   Nurses again found clonidine pills in patient's room. Searched through
   patient's belongings and bed-clothes and found nothing else at this
   point.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary embolism, who presented to the emergency department (ED) with suicidal ideation and was found to be somnolent and bradycardic. The patient is on methadone maintenance for heroin abuse.

The patient has been found to have smuggled clonidine into the hospital room, which has caused him to be hypotensive and has led to an increase in his heart rate to the 60s. The patient has also been found to have clonidine pills in his room.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 42 beats per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 141/74 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 13 inspirations per minute (ipm), and his oxygen saturation is 96%. His neurological examination is normal, and he is responding to verbal commands.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8, a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 215,000/microliter. His creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Intoxication/OD: The patient has been continuously overdosing on clonidine, which has caused him to be hypotensive and has led to an increase in his heart rate.
* Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures with orthostatic changes on sitting, but does not become tachycardic.
* PE s/p filter: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis.
* COPD: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is on tiotropium and albuterol as needed.
* FEN: The patient is on a regular diet and is replete with electrolytes as needed.
* PPx: The patient is on prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Rebound hypertension: The patient's use of clonidine may lead to rebound hypertension if the medication is stopped suddenly.
* Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may worsen if the clonidine is not tapered off slowly.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and the use of heparin for prophylaxis may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
* COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment for his condition.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's use of heparin for prophylaxis may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
* Suicidal ideation: The patient's suicidal ideation may worsen if he is not treated for his underlying depression and other mental health conditions."
