 HEMOPTYSIS
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trache site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and welling into post. oralpharynx.
   - s/p ENT packing as well as neuro IR coiling of inf thyroid artery
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - plan for XRT today on [**Hospital Ward Name **]
   - appreciate ENT
   - appreciate rad onc
   - follow-up oncology recs regarding any additional chemo
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed
   - s/p IVC filter placement
   - monitor for HD instability, SOB, hypoxia given potential for PE
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna
   - resend sputum cx
   - f/u CXR this AM
   - add on diff
   - blood, urine cx
   - if spikes, would start Vanc/Zosyn for broad coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, due to complete 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco today. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA
   but has had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this
   admission as well as elevated WBC.
   - re-send sputum culture
   - d/c all abx today as he will have completed a 10 day course
   - aspiration precautions
   - trache care
   - continue nebs
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs
   - percocet prn pain
   - Spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding additional agents if elevated
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Bleeding: The patient has experienced significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which may continue to be a risk factor for bleeding complications.
2. Pneumonitis/Recurrence of Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent bleeding into the oral pharynx and possibly airways may have caused pneumonitis or recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be well-controlled, and additional antihypertensive medications may be necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation, and further monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and treatment.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's chronic hyponatremia may be exacerbated by hypovolemia, and fluid restriction may be necessary to manage this condition.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and further deterioration may occur if not managed appropriately.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and may be at risk for developing further infections, particularly in the setting of his compromised immune system.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding into the oral pharynx and possibly airways may have caused gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be a risk factor for further bleeding complications.

The patient's plan of care should include:

1. Close monitoring of bleeding complications and respiratory status.
2. Administration of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent further infections.
3. Management of hypertension and anemia.
4. Fluid restriction to manage hyponatremia.
5. Continuation of respiratory therapy and oxygen support as needed.
6. Consideration of further imaging studies to rule out pulmonary embolism.
7. Monitoring for signs of infection and further bleeding complications.
8. Coordination with the radiation oncology team to ensure proper management of the patient's cancer treatment.
9. Consideration of further medical therapy to manage the patient's underlying conditions."

        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT today
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  Already on Vanc / Zosyn.
   - f/u sputum cx data

   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
   #. Bleeding from trache site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - will get mapping and XRT today on [**Hospital Ward Name **]
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin)
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stop current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT today
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  Already on Vanc / Zosyn.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stop Vanc / Zosyn today, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, due to complete 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco today. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA
   but has had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this
   admission as well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c Vanc / Zosyn today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers

   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx, who underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed. He was admitted to the ICU for a right lower extremity (RLE) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on a tracheostomy tube with a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 559 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 12.2 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mEq/L
* Sodium: 130 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L
* Chloride: 95 mEq/L
* CO2: 27.8%
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for a previous aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and a history of SCC of the larynx. He has also undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed.

The patient's current medications include:

* Propofol: 70 mcg/Kg/min
* Vecuronium: 01:30 PM
* Labetalol: 02:15 PM
* Ranitidine: 08:00 PM
* Clindamycin: to be started for ENT coverage

The patient's plan includes:

* Transfer to a hospital ward for radiation therapy
* Follow-up with oncology for additional chemotherapy recommendations
* Maintenance of active surveillance for bleeding
* No anticoagulation due to recent bleeding
* Antibiotics for ENT coverage, to be started as Clindamycin

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's history of aspiration PNA and the presence of a tracheostomy tube
* Recurrent bleeding from the tracheostomy site
* Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of RLE DVT and immobility
* Hypertension due to the patient's history of hypertension and the need for improved blood pressure control
* Anemia due to chronic bleeding and inflammation
* Hyponatremia due to chronic hypovolemia and possible contribution from SIADH
* COPD exacerbation due to the patient's history of COPD and the need for continued nebulizer therapy
* Sepsis due to the patient's history of aspiration PNA and the presence of a tracheostomy tube

The patient's care plan should be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary to prevent these complications and ensure optimal management of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of CVA, hyponatremia, and SCC of the larynx, who presented with hemoptysis and bleeding from the tracheostomy site. The patient had undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed, tracheostomy, and PEG placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on invasive ventilation, with a chest x-ray showing a patchy left lower lobe infiltrate and left lower lobe atelectasis, which has improved.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a distant heart sound, with a blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg, and a heart rate of 87 bpm.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated, with intact cranial nerves 2-6.
* Hematology: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and is receiving blood transfusions.
* Coagulation: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1.
* Infection: The patient has a contaminated oral flora in the sputum, and is being treated for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which requires close monitoring and potential surgery.
* Right leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is being managed with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
* Aspiration PNA, which requires continued antibiotic treatment and close monitoring.
* Laryngeal cancer, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
* Hypertension, which is being managed with medication.
* Anemia, which is being monitored and managed.
* Hyponatremia, which is being monitored and may require fluid restriction.
* COPD, which is being managed with nebulizer treatments.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Close monitoring of bleeding from the tracheostomy site.
* Continued antibiotic treatment for aspiration PNA.
* Evaluation and treatment of laryngeal cancer.
* Management of hypertension and anemia.
* Fluid restriction for hyponatremia, if necessary.
* Close monitoring of respiratory status.
* Transfer to a hospital ward for radiation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a recent CVA, hyponatremia, and a history of SCC of the larynx. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of right leg DVT and was found to have bleeding from his tracheostomy site.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 425. He has a patchy left lower lobe infiltrate and atelectasis on chest x-ray.
* Cardiovascular: His blood pressure is stable, and he is not showing any signs of heart failure or instability.
* Neurological: He is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. His CNs 2-6 are intact.
* Hematology: His hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL, and he has a platelet count of 559. He has a history of bleeding and is at risk of further bleeding.
* Renal: His creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and his urine output is adequate.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which may require surgical intervention if it recurs.
* Respiratory failure, which may require escalation of respiratory support.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, which may require cardiac monitoring and treatment.
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure, which may require neurological monitoring and treatment.
* Hematological complications, such as further bleeding or anemia, which may require transfusions or other interventions.
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, which may require renal monitoring and treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia.
* Monitoring for bleeding from the tracheostomy site.
* Weaning from sedation and intubation.
* Starting tube feeds once approved by the radiation oncology team.
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
* Continuing to monitor for neurological and hematological complications.
* Transferring the patient to a hospital ward for radiation therapy.

Overall, this patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx, who was previously admitted for a hypopharyngeal bleed and underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery. He was later transferred to a rehabilitation center, where he developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg. He was readmitted to the hospital for filter placement and treatment of the DVT. During his current admission, he experienced significant bleeding from his tracheostomy site, which was packed and coiled by the ENT team. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since April 30th and has been receiving antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding from tracheostomy site: The patient's bleeding from the tracheostomy site is a significant concern, and it is essential to monitor his condition closely to prevent further bleeding. If the bleeding returns, the patient may require surgical intervention.
2. DVT: The patient has a DVT in his right leg, which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism (PE) and hemodynamic instability. He is not an anticoagulation candidate due to recent bleeding, but he has an IR-guided IVC filter in place.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and he is currently receiving antibiotics. It is essential to continue monitoring his condition and adjusting his antibiotic regimen as needed.
4. Laryngeal cancer: The patient has laryngeal cancer, which is complicated by his recent right inferior thyroid artery bleed. He will require follow-up care, including chemoradiation and teeth extraction as an outpatient.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is currently controlled with medication. He will need to continue taking his medication and monitor his blood pressure closely.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation. He will need to be monitored closely, especially in the setting of bleeding.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia, which may be exacerbated by his recent bleeding. He may require fluid restriction if his serum and urine osmolalities are consistent with SIADH.
8. COPD: The patient has COPD, but he does not currently have any active symptoms. He will need to continue receiving nebulizer treatments as ordered.
9. CVA: The patient has a history of CVA, but he does not have any active issues at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of SCC of the larynx, hyponatremia, and a recent CVA. He was admitted to the ICU for right LE DVT and developed significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Bleeding from trache site: The patient has had two episodes of bleeding from the tracheostomy site, with the most recent episode being packed and coiled. He will need to be unpacked by ENT and will require further management, including radiation therapy today, and potential surgery if bleeding returns.
* Right LE DVT: The patient has a DVT on his right leg, which is not an anticoagulation candidate due to recent bleeding. An IR-guided IVC filter has been placed.
* Aspiration PNA: The patient has a history of aspiration PNA and is currently on antibiotics. He will continue to receive antibiotics until the issue is resolved, and will have his sputum cultured again tomorrow.
* Laryngeal Ca: The patient has a complicated laryngeal cancer due to recent bleeding from the right inferior thyroid artery. He will require further management, including chemoradiation and teeth extraction as an outpatient.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normal, and he will continue to take lisinopril 40mg daily.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation. He will continue to be monitored, especially in the setting of bleeding.
* Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia, which appears to be hypovolemic, but could also be related to SIADH. Serum and urine osmolality levels are pending, and fluid restriction may be necessary if SIADH is confirmed.
* COPD: The patient has no current complaints of SOB or dyspnea, increased cough, or change in sputum production.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on a tracheostomy tube.

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 559 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.7 mg/dL

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Radiation therapy for bleeding from trache site
* Antibiotics for aspiration PNA
* Chemoradiation and teeth extraction for laryngeal Ca
* Monitoring for anemia and hyponatremia
* Fluid restriction if SIADH is confirmed
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Transfer to a hospital ward for radiation therapy

The patient's disposition is to transfer to a hospital ward for radiation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of SCC of the larynx, s/p coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery, and admission for right LE DVT. The patient has been experiencing significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was suctioned and stabilized.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a risk of further bleeding, aspiration, and potential respiratory failure. The patient is on invasive ventilation, and his respiratory support is being closely monitored.

The patient has a history of anemia, hyponatremia, and COPD, which are being managed accordingly. The patient is also at risk for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, and prophylactic measures are being taken.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which can lead to respiratory failure and aspiration.
2. Aspiration pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure.
4. Stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and worsen the patient's overall condition.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Anemia, which can worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Hyponatremia, which can worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of respiratory failure.

The patient's management plan includes:

1. Close monitoring of the tracheostomy site for further bleeding.
2. Frequent suctioning and careful management of secretions.
3. Invasive ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia.
5. Prophylactic measures to prevent DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's anemia and hyponatremia.
7. Frequent communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure that the patient's needs are being met."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of CVA, hyponatremia, and SCC of the larynx. He was admitted to the ICU for right LE DVT and developed significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. He underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery, filter placement, and IR-guided emolization of the tumor. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of aspiration PNA.

Assessment:

1. Bleeding from trache site: The patient has significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was packed and coiled. He will need to be unpacked by ENT and will require radiation therapy today. If bleeding returns, he will need surgery.
2. Right LE DVT: The patient has a DVT on OSH right LE, which is not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. An IR-guided IVC filter is in place.
3. Respiratory: The patient is on CMV ventilation and will need to be checked for gas exchange prior to transfer. He will be transferred on CMV and will be weaned to CPAP once transferred.
4. Aspiration PNA: The patient has a history of aspiration PNA and will continue current antibiotics until the issue is resolved. Sputum culture is consistent with MSSA, but he has had MRSA in the past.
5. Laryngeal Ca: The patient has a complicated laryngeal cancer with recent right inferior thyroid artery bleed. He will need to follow up for chemoradiation and teeth extraction as an outpatient.
6. Hypertension: The patient is currently normotensive and will continue to take lisinopril 40mg daily at home.
7. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation. He will need to be monitored, especially in the setting of bleeding.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia, which may be related to SIADH. Serum and urine Osmos are pending, and he will be fluid-restricted if consistent with SIADH.
9. COPD: The patient has no current complaints of SOB or dyspnea, increased cough, or change in sputum production.
10. s/p CVA: The patient has no active issues related to his CVA and is not on ASA secondary to bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding from trache site: Continued bleeding from the tracheostomy site may lead to respiratory compromise and require surgical intervention.
2. Right LE DVT: The patient's DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) and hemodynamic instability if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Aspiration PNA: The patient's history of aspiration PNA may lead to recurrent respiratory infections and pneumonia.
5. Laryngeal Ca: The patient's laryngeal cancer may progress and lead to respiratory compromise if not properly managed.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiac complications if not properly managed.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function if not properly managed.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may lead to seizures, coma, and death if not properly managed.
9. COPD: The patient's COPD may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
10. s/p CVA: The patient's history of CVA may lead to recurrent strokes if not properly managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complex medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 137/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and their respiratory support is being managed with a tracheostomy tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, and a set tidal volume of 500 mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.43, pCO2 of 45 mmHg, pO2 of 170 mmHg, and a bicarbonate level of 27 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 559 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 130 mmol/L, potassium level of 4.5 mmol/L, and chloride level of 95 mmol/L.

The patient has a history of hemoptysis, and their airway is at risk due to their inability to protect it. They are also at risk for aspiration, altered airway clearance, and cough.

The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. They are also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for invasive ventilation and the risk of respiratory failure due to their underlying lung disease.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing pneumonia due to their prolonged intubation and the presence of a tracheostomy tube.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk of developing VAP due to the presence of a tracheostomy tube and the prolonged use of invasive ventilation.
4. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration due to their inability to protect their airway and the presence of a tracheostomy tube.
5. Sepsis: The patient's risk of developing sepsis due to their underlying medical conditions and the presence of a central line.
6. Bleeding: The patient's risk of bleeding due to their anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a central line.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's risk of developing kidney injury due to their underlying medical conditions and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
8. Liver injury: The patient's risk of developing liver injury due to their underlying medical conditions and the use of hepatotoxic medications.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management of their complex medical conditions. Potential medical complications can arise from their conditions, and it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these complications."

 HEMOPTYSIS
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - s/p mapping and first session XRT today, to continue tomorrow.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement
 ENT plans to remove packing
   tomorrow.  Med onc wants dental work and CT head and neck, hold off on
   CT today given recent dye load in IR.  Readdress in 24-48 hours after
   monitoring creatinine.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to consideration of
   extubation.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, due to complete 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco today. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA
   but has had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this
   admission as well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, who was admitted to the ICU for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. He underwent coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery and has been receiving radiation therapy. The patient is mechanically ventilated and has been experiencing bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which has been packed by the ENT team. He has also been experiencing leukocytosis, which may be related to pneumonitis or recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site: The patient has been experiencing persistent bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which may continue to occur and require further interventions.
2. Pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to pneumonitis or recurrent aspiration pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated in the past, and he may require further management to control his hypertension.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to bleeding and inflammation, and he may require further transfusions.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's chronic hyponatremia may be related to hypovolemia, but could also be related to SIADH, which would require further management.
7. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, which may require further management to control his respiratory symptoms.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and may be at risk for further infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding from the tracheostomy site and provide further interventions as necessary.
2. Consider further management of the patient's pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pneumonia, including antibiotics and respiratory therapy.
3. Monitor the patient's deep vein thrombosis and consider further anticoagulation therapy.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and anemia.
5. Further investigate the patient's hyponatremia and consider management options for SIADH.
6. Continue to manage the patient's COPD and provide respiratory therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and provide antibiotics as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with an unknown allergy to penicillins. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone angiography. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving propofol and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 131/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 2,513 mL in and 1,580 mL out, with a total output of 933 mL. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.2, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 559. The patient's coagulation studies show a prothrombin time of 12.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time of 24.6 seconds, and international normalized ratio of 1.1.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation and tracheostomy tube increase the risk of developing VAP.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
3. Hemoptysis: The patient's bleeding from the respiratory tract can lead to respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
4. Septicemia: The patient's use of antibiotics and presence of a central line increase the risk of developing septicemia.
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs): The patient's central line and peripheral lines increase the risk of developing CRBSIs.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and use of heparin sodium prophylaxis increase the risk of developing DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of developing stress ulcer.
8. Worsening of respiratory function: The patient's underlying respiratory disease and prolonged ventilation increase the risk of worsening respiratory function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Perform regular suctioning and airway clearance to prevent aspiration.
3. Monitor the patient's bleeding and hemodynamic status closely, and consider transfusing blood products if necessary.
4. Continue to administer antibiotics and monitor for signs of septicemia.
5. Monitor the patient's central and peripheral lines for signs of infection, and consider removing them if necessary.
6. Continue to use heparin sodium prophylaxis to prevent DVT.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary to prevent stress ulcer.
8. Consider performing a bronchoscopy to evaluate the patient's airway and rule out VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - s/p mapping and first session XRT today, to continue tomorrow.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement
 ENT plans to remove packing
   tomorrow.  Med onc wants dental work and CT head and neck, hold off on
   CT today given recent dye load in IR.  Readdress in 24-48 hours after
   monitoring creatinine.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to consideration of
   extubation.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, due to complete 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco today. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA
   but has had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this
   admission as well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site. He has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed. He is currently mechanically ventilated and has been receiving antibiotics for coverage. The patient has developed leukocytosis and has a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is being monitored. He is also at risk for aspiration pneumonia and has a history of aspiration pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure is currently normotensive, but he has a history of hypertension. He has anemia, which is likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation, and hyponatremia, which is chronic and may be related to hypovolemia or SIADH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which may continue to occur and require further intervention.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for recurrent episodes, particularly with the development of a new infiltrate on chest X-ray.
3. Pneumonitis: The patient's leukocytosis and new infiltrate on chest X-ray may indicate pneumonitis, which could be caused by aspiration or infection.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in his right lower extremity, which may require further anticoagulation therapy.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and may require further management to control his blood pressure.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if bleeding and inflammation continue, and may require further transfusions.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be related to hypovolemia or SIADH, and may require further management to correct.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently mechanically ventilated and may require further support if his respiratory status deteriorates.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
3. Consider further anticoagulation therapy for the DVT.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Consider further transfusions for the patient's anemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hyponatremia and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Consider further management for the patient's pneumonia, including antibiotics and bronchodilators.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.
   -Trial of PS
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, who has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for a hypopharyngeal bleed.
* He is currently mechanically ventilated due to refractory bleeding around the tracheostomy site.
* He has a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and malignancy.
* He has leukocytosis, which may be related to the recent bleeding and inflammation, and has not spiked a fever in 24 hours.
* He has a history of aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics.
* He has anemia, likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation, and is being monitored closely.
* He has hyponatremia, which may be related to hypovolemia or SIADH, and is being monitored.
* He has chronic hyponatremia and is being restricted from fluids.

**Potential Complications:**

* Bleeding from the tracheostomy site: The patient's bleeding has been slow and persistent, and may require further embolization or surgical intervention.
* Pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration PNA: The patient's leukocytosis and new infiltrate on CXRs suggest the possibility of pneumonitis or recurrent aspiration PNA.
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and malignancy make him at risk for PE, which could be exacerbated by the recent bleeding.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if bleeding continues or if there is ongoing inflammation.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if fluids are restricted, and may require further evaluation and management.
* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and potential source of infection (bleeding and inflammation) make him at risk for sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and recent bleeding may put him at risk for respiratory failure.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust management accordingly.
* Repeat ABG and consider adjusting FiO2 and ventilator settings.
* Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider sending blood and urine cultures.
* Consider adding antibiotics for coverage of potential infections.
* Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hyponatremia and consider restricting fluids if necessary.
* Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to prevent PE, but only if the patient is not actively bleeding.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust management accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.
   -Trial of PS
 attempt to keep off vent.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   - Cont hep SC
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bleeding from the tracheostomy site. He has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleeding. He is currently mechanically ventilated and receiving antibiotics for coverage of the tracheostomy site. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and hyponatremia, which are being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site: The patient has had persistent bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which has required embolization of the suprarenal and inferior thyroid arteries. The patient is at risk for continued bleeding and may require further interventions.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has developed a new infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is at risk for developing pneumonia, particularly given his recent bleeding and aspiration events.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is at risk for developing respiratory failure, particularly if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be secondary to bleeding and inflammation. He may require further transfusions or other interventions to manage his anemia.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia, which may be secondary to hypovolemia or SIADH. He may require fluid restriction and close monitoring to manage his hyponatremia.
6. DVT: The patient has a DVT in his right lower extremity, which may be at risk for propagation or pulmonary embolism.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, particularly given his recent bleeding and anemia.

ICU Care:

The patient is receiving ICU care, including mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and close monitoring of his laboratory results. He is also receiving nutrition support and glycemic control measures. His lines include a PICC line and an 18-gauge line, and he is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   67-yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right inferior
   thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and PEG
   [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.
   -Trial of PS
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   - no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bleeding from the tracheostomy site, and hypopharyngeal bleed. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Mechanically ventilated with a tracheostomy tube, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cmH2O, and a plateau pressure of 12 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a mean arterial pressure of 118 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,468 mL of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 1,130 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count is 105 mg/dL. His serum sodium is 132 mEq/L, and his serum potassium is 4.3 mEq/L.
* Bleeding: The patient has experienced significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, which was initially stabilized with packing but has now been removed. The patient is at risk for rebleeding and may require further interventions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already mechanically ventilated, and further deterioration in his respiratory status could lead to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has received antibiotics for coverage of possible infections. He is at risk for developing sepsis, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding from the tracheostomy site or other areas, which could lead to hypovolemic shock or other complications.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation, and he may require further transfusions to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
* Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely chronic, but could be exacerbated by further fluid shifts or other factors.
* COPD: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and further deterioration in his respiratory status could lead to respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Monitoring of his bleeding and hemodynamic status
* Antibiotic coverage for possible infections
* Further transfusions as needed to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels
* Fluid restriction to manage his hyponatremia
* Continued monitoring of his respiratory status and COPD symptoms
* Follow-up with oncology and radiation oncology to discuss further treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old male, is in the ICU with respiratory failure due to SCCA in the larynx. He has undergone tracheostomy and packing for bleeding, and initial mapping and radiation therapy (XRT). The patient has had encouraging absence of bleeding following removal of packing. He is currently receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure:
	* Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and SCCA, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, especially with the presence of basilar infiltrates on CXR.
	* Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of the ventilator increases the risk of developing VAP.
	* Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): The patient's respiratory failure and SCCA may lead to RDS, especially if the patient develops a lung injury.
2. Hemothorax:
	* Bleeding complications: The patient's history of significant pharyngeal bleeding and embolization increases the risk of bleeding complications, including hemothorax.
	* Pleural effusion: The patient's SCCA and respiratory failure may lead to the development of a pleural effusion.
3. DVT:
	* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobility and history of upper airway bleeding increase the risk of developing DVT.
	* Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's DVT may lead to PE, which can be life-threatening.
4. Infection:
	* Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and SCCA increase the risk of developing sepsis, especially if the patient develops pneumonia or another infection.
	* Meningitis: The patient's SCCA and respiratory failure may lead to the development of meningitis, especially if there is a bacterial infection.
5. Nutritional Complications:
	* Malnutrition: The patient's respiratory failure and SCCA may lead to malnutrition, especially if the patient is unable to eat or is fed through a tube.
	* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's SCCA and respiratory failure may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, including respiratory failure, hemothorax, DVT, infection, and nutritional complications. Close monitoring and management of these risks are essential to ensure the patient's safety and optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and
   PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.
   -Trial of PS
 attempt to keep off vent.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   - Cont hep SC
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man w/ SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p trache and
   PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/ significant bleeding from
   trache site.
   .
   #. Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  We will hold off on getting a CT as recent radiation will
   increase artifact and it likely will not change treatment.
   - if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   - Continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   - appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   - follow-up Oncology recs regarding additional chemo (? Cisplatin), to
   be started as outpatient.
   - maintain active T&S
   - no anticoagulation
   - will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   .
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Decrease Fi02 tonight given most recent ABG with Pa02 124, repeat at
   11pm.  Keep ventilated overnight and tomorrow while packing removed and
   for next rad onc session. Re-eval bleeding prior to dropping cuff on
   trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop cuff and use trach
   mask.
   -Trial of PS
 attempt to keep off vent.
   .
   #. RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   - Cont hep SC
   .
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC improved after switching to clinda.
   - f/u sputum cx data
   - send blood, urine cx as well
   - stopped Vanc / Zosyn, start Clinda as above for ENT coverage
   .
   #. Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   .
   #. Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG.
   - f/u onc and rad onc recs as above
   - Green team spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**] in [**Hospital3 1959**]
   .
   #. Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   - cont home lisinopril 40mg daily
   - consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   .
   #. Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secodary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   - continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   - s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   - f/u Osms-> c/w SIADH, so will fluid restrict
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   - continue home nebs
   .
   #. s/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

   # Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  He underwent XRT on [**5-1**] and [**5-2**] and there have been no
   bleeding incidents since.
   -if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery (will readdress
   this issue today with patient)
   -continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   -appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   -medical oncology notes suggest that chemotherapy could be started as
   outpatient with definitive XRT
   -maintain active T&S
   -no anticoagulation
   -will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Could consider taking off vent this morning as he has been tolerating
   pressure support [**4-29**] with no difficulty. Re-eval bleeding prior to
   dropping cuff on trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop
   cuff and use trach mask.

   # RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   -continue HSQ
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved

   -f/u sputum cx data
   -continue Clindamycin as above for ENT coverage
   # Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as

   # Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   -cont home lisinopril 40 mg daily
   -consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   # Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secondary to bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU for significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, complicated by a right LE DVT and s/p coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery. He has a history of SCC of the larynx, s/p tracheostomy, and PEG. He underwent XRT on days 1 and 2 and has been stable since. The patient has been mechanically ventilated due to refractory bleeding around the tracheostomy site. He has been tolerating pressure support with no difficulty.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebleeding: The patient is at risk for rebleeding from the tracheostomy site, which could lead to respiratory distress, hypoxia, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Pneumonitis/Recurrent Aspiration PNA: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated WBC count may indicate pneumonitis or recurrent aspiration PNA, which could worsen his respiratory status.
3. DVT/PE: The patient's right LE DVT and IVC filter placement increase his risk for pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not controlled, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed appropriately, potentially leading to cardiovascular instability.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's chronic hyponatremia may worsen if not managed, potentially leading to neurological complications.
7. COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen if not managed appropriately, potentially leading to respiratory distress.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Consider taking off the ventilator and using a trache mask if the patient is tolerating pressure support with no difficulty.
3. Monitor the patient's WBC count and consider further evaluation for pneumonitis or recurrent aspiration PNA.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hyponatremia and consider adjusting treatment accordingly.
7. Continue to manage the patient's COPD with nebulizers and monitor for worsening respiratory status."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man with SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p
   tracheostomy and PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/
   significant bleeding from trache site.
   # Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  He underwent XRT on [**5-1**] and [**5-2**] and there have been no
   bleeding incidents since.
   -if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
   -continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   -appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   -medical oncology notes suggest that chemotherapy could be started as
   outpatient with definitive XRT
   -maintain active T&S
   -no anticoagulation
   -will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Placed on ventilator for further airway
   protection in the setting of refractory bleeding around trach site.
   Could consider taking off vent this morning as he has been tolerating
   pressure support [**4-29**] with no difficulty. Re-eval bleeding prior to
   dropping cuff on trach.  If not actively bleeding may be able to drop
   cuff and use trach mask.
   -trial of PS
 attempt to take off vent this morning
   # RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   -continue HSQ
   # Leukocytosis: New in setting of events yesterday. He has not spike a
   temp in 24 hrs, and no obvious localizing source. Given bleeding into
   OP and possibly airways yesterday, there is concern for
   pneumonitis/recurrent aspiration pna. Sputum Cx re-sent. CXR improved
   today AM. Diff w/ 86% PMNs.  WBC now back to normal.
   -f/u sputum cx data
   -continue Clindamycin as above for ENT coverage
   # Aspiration PNA - Pt has h/o aspiration PNA, has comlpeted 10-day
   course of Ceftaz and Vanco. Sputum cx here consistent with MSSA but has
   had MRSA in past. Now with new RLL infiltrate on CXRs this admission as
   well as elevated WBC.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - d/c
d today as he has completed a 10 day course
   - cont aspiration precautions, trache care, nebulizers
   # Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG. Will
   begin chemotherapy likely as outpatient.
   # Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   -cont home lisinopril 40 mg daily
   -consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   # Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secondary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   -continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   -s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   # Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   Sodium today WNL.
   -continue to monitor
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   -continue home nebs
   # S/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man admitted to the ICU for significant bleeding from the tracheostomy site, complicated by a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a history of laryngeal cancer. The patient has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleeding, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's current condition is stable, with no active bleeding from the tracheostomy site since the embolization procedure. He is mechanically ventilated and receiving pressure support via the tracheostomy tube. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 138/72 mmHg.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site: Although the patient is currently stable, there is a risk of rebleeding, which could be catastrophic.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a DVT and is at risk for pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has developed a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could be a sign of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but he has a history of hypertension and may require further treatment to maintain control.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to bleeding and inflammation, and he may require further transfusions or treatment to address this issue.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is chronic and may be related to hypovolemia, SIADH, or other factors. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address this issue.
7. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, but his current symptoms are stable, and he is receiving treatment as needed.

In terms of laboratory results, the patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with a differential showing a predominance of neutrophils. His platelet count is stable, and his coagulation studies are normal. His liver function tests are within normal limits, and his renal function is stable.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of his bleeding risk and airway management.
2. Maintenance of his mechanical ventilation and pressure support.
3. Administration of antibiotics for coverage of potential infections.
4. Monitoring of his DVT and potential for pulmonary embolism.
5. Treatment of his hypertension, anemia, and hyponatremia as necessary.
6. Management of his COPD and potential aspiration pneumonia.
7. Consideration of chemotherapy for his laryngeal cancer, likely as an outpatient."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) who underwent tracheostomy and packing for bleeding after initial mapping and radiation therapy (XRT). He has had an encouraging absence of bleeding following removal of packing. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, hemoptysis, DVT, and laryngeal cancer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. He is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood chemistry results show mild anemia, normal liver enzymes, and mild electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with a tracheostomy tube, neck swelling, and clear breath sounds. He is alert and oriented, with normal cardiovascular and abdominal examination.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his laryngeal cancer and tracheostomy.
3. DVT: The patient has a DVT and is at risk for pulmonary embolism.
4. Laryngeal cancer: The patient has a laryngeal cancer and may require further treatment, including surgery.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to his underlying liver disease and medication use.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications due to his age and underlying cardiovascular disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation as necessary.
2. Continue to watch for signs of bleeding and hemoptysis.
3. Repeat CT scan when XRT is stabilized to assess for any changes in the patient's condition.
4. Discuss the patient's wishes for surgery if he rebleeds.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medication as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medication as necessary.
7. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 67 yo man with SCC of the larynx s/p coil embolization of right
   inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed [**3-/2177**], s/p
   tracheostomy and PEG [**3-/2177**], admitted for right LE DVT, now w/
   significant bleeding from trache site.
   # Bleeding from trach site - Initially stable upon arrival to ICU;
   however, on hosp day 2, developed slow, persistant bleeding around
   trachea and into posterior oropharynx. Packed by ENT and now s/p
   embolization of sup/inf thyroid artery by neuron IR. Hct currently
   stable.  Patient was unpacked on [**2177-5-2**] with resolution of the
   bleeding.  He underwent XRT on [**5-1**] and [**5-2**] and there have been no
   bleeding incidents since.
   -if rebleeds, family would want aggressive ENT surgery
 However this
   decision was made a while ago and may need to be readdressed with him
   and his family.
   -continue XRT to head/neck for bleeding control.
   -appreciate ENT, Rad-Onc involvement.
   -medical oncology notes suggest that chemotherapy could be started as
   outpatient with definitive XRT
   -maintain active T&S
   -no anticoagulation
   -will need antibiotics per ENT for coverage:
        - stopped current Abx (Vanc / Zosyn) [**4-30**] as not needed anymore
        - start Clindamycin for ENT coverage, clarify need and length w/
   ENT
   # Mechanically ventilated:  Patient now weaned off to trach mask and
   doing well.
   # RLE DVT - DVT on OSH right LENI, no si/sx of PE or HD instability.
   Not an anticoagulation candidate given recent bleeding. Likely [**1-27**]
   decreased mobility at rehab and malignancy.  Had IVC filter placed
   [**2177-4-30**].  No si/sx to raise concern for PE.
   -no anticoagulation given recent bleed, s/p IVC filter placement
   -continue HSQ
   # Leukocytosis: No new infectious source found. WBC improving on clinda
   and he has reached a baseline [**10-5**].
   -f/u sputum cx data
   -continue Clindamycin as above for ENT coverage
   # Aspiration PNA
 Completed course of ABX for asp pna for MRSA.
   -Cont asp precautions.
   # Laryngeal Ca - Complicated by recent right inferior thyroid artery
   bleed s/p coil embolization [**3-/2177**] by IR. S/p trache and PEG. Will
   begin chemotherapy likely as outpatient.
   # Hypertension - Currently normo-tensive, was hypertensive yesterday.
   Per ENT, needs improved control w/ SBP 120s.
   -cont home lisinopril 40 mg daily
   -consider adding BB as needed (prefer IV Labetalol)
   # Anemia - Stable from recent baseline 25-28. Likely secondary to bleed
   and inflammation. Fe-studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
   -continue to monitor closely, esp. in setting of bleeding
   -s/p 2U PRBC on [**4-30**]
   # Hyponatremia - Chronic, at baseline. Appears to be hypovolemic, but
   could consider contribution from SIADH. Serum and urine Osms pending.
   Sodium today WNL.
   -continue to monitor
   #. COPD - No current complaints of SOB or dypnea, increased cough or
   change in sputum production.
   -continue home nebs
   # S/p CVA: No active issues. Not on ASA secondary to bleed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx who has undergone coil embolization of the right inferior thyroid artery for hypopharyngeal bleed, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and bleeding from the tracheostomy site.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/56 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97% on a tracheal mask.

The patient has undergone embolization of the superior and inferior thyroid arteries and has had no bleeding incidents since. He has been weaned off mechanical ventilation and is now receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheal mask.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but no new infectious source has been identified.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently normal, but he was hypertensive yesterday and needs improved control.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but he is likely to have anemia of chronic disease due to bleeding and inflammation.
* Hyponatremia: The patient has chronic hyponatremia, which is likely due to hypovolemia, but could also be caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has no current symptoms of shortness of breath or cough, but he has a history of COPD.

The patient's medications include:

* Clindamycin for enteral coverage
* Ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis
* Lisinopril for hypertension
* Labetalol for hypertension (as needed)

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 18.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 27.8 g/L
* Platelet count: 425 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing chemotherapy as an outpatient
* Maintaining active surveillance for bleeding
* Not anticoagulating due to recent bleeding
* Continuing enteral nutrition and glycemic control
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotics as necessary
* Continuing stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Monitoring for signs of hyponatremia and adjusting treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer, who has undergone tracheostomy and packing for bleeding, followed by initial mapping and radiation therapy. He has had encouraging absence of bleeding following removal of packing. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV), and is being monitored for respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 148/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,834 mL, with a total out of 1,595 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.0, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 488, and creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as he is on invasive ventilation and is being monitored for respiratory failure. The possibility of further bleeding or respiratory compromise is a potential complication.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's history of hemoptysis and recent bleeding make him at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to respiratory compromise or other complications.
3. DVT: The patient has an IVC filter in place, but he is at risk for developing DVT due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
4. Laryngeal Cancer: The patient's underlying cancer diagnosis and recent radiation therapy make him at risk for complications such as wound healing issues, infections, and further bleeding.
5. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as he is receiving a pulmonary nutrition supplement, but may be at risk for deficiencies due to his underlying medical conditions and potential for malabsorption.
6. Infections: The patient's underlying medical conditions and recent radiation therapy make him at risk for infections, which could lead to further complications.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of bleeding and recent radiation therapy make him at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."
