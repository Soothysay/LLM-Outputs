   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema.
   #.  Hypoxia:
   94% on 15L NRB, but not tachypnic, speaking in full sentences. CXR/lung
   exam consistent with pulmonary edema. Cr has been rising with mild
   diuresis c/w diastolic dysfunction seen on recent ECHO. Pt. has been
   very fluid positive for length of stay. Would also consider PE given
   rapid onset of hypoxia if does not improve w/ diuresis but has not been
   hypotense or more tachycardic.
   - Lasix drip titrate to >100cc/hr
   - consider repeat ECHO if difficulty diuresing
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   - Now OK to intubate if necessary
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.
   - Will continue to diurese given pulmonary edema and large O2
   requirement.
   - Renal U/S to r/o obstruction
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - will d/w primary onc team whether to put in doboff after her
   oxygenation is more stable as not a candidate for G-tube currently.
   - Question PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   - Nutrition consult for tube feeding or TPN recs pending route of
   nutrition
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio. HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, likely related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   Controlled at this time, though was a bit borderline with systolics in
   the 100s and would benefit from drifting up a bit while diuresing.
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   - Diltiazem for rate control as blood pressure allows

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema.
* She has been experiencing hypoxia, with a SpO2 of 100% on 15L NRB, but is not tachypnic. CXR and lung exam are consistent with pulmonary edema.
* The patient has been very fluid-positive for the length of her stay, and her creatinine has been rising with mild diuresis, suggesting diastolic dysfunction.
* The patient has been given Lasix drip to titrate to >100cc/hr, and repeat ECHO may be considered if difficulty diuresing persists.
* The patient has also been experiencing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypertension, which are being managed accordingly.
* The patient has been in remission from cancer, but LDH has been rising, and follow-up oncology recommendations are being sought.
* The patient has also been experiencing skin issues, including intertriginal erythema, which is being managed with miconazole powder.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pulmonary edema worsening, leading to respiratory failure
* Diastolic dysfunction worsening, leading to cardiogenic shock
* Anemia worsening, leading to further respiratory compromise
* Thrombocytopenia worsening, leading to increased risk of bleeding
* Hypothyroidism worsening, leading to further metabolic compromise
* Skin infections worsening, leading to sepsis
* Malnutrition worsening, leading to further respiratory and cardiac compromise
* Hypertension worsening, leading to further cardiovascular compromise
* Atrial fibrillation worsening, leading to further cardiovascular compromise

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management of her conditions, including diuresis, nutrition, and medication adjustments as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema.
   #.  Hypoxia:
   The patient is currently 100% on medium concentration mask, but not
   tachypnic, speaking in full sentences. Differential is broad and
   includes pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and low
   oncoltic pressures secondary to malnutrition.  Alternatively,
   infectious causes such as influenza or PNA could be considered.
   Finally, pulmonary embolism could present with hypoxia, although
   radiographic presence of bilateral infiltrates on CXR, with chest pain,
   hypotension or tachycardia make it less likely.   CXR/lung exam is
   consistent with pulmonary edema, however IJ is not distended.   Cr has
   been rising with mild diuresis c/w diastolic dysfunction seen on recent
   ECHO. Pt. has been very fluid positive for length of stay. Given a
   combination of nausea in a patient with known distolic dysfunction,
   will rule out for MI.
   - Continue aggressive duresis with Lasix and monitor response
   -Will start empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP if no improvement in
   oxygenation following aggressive duresis over the next several hours

   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Renal U/S was performed and preliminary read indicates no
   hydronephrosis. Doppler evaluation extremely limited given patient
   inability to breath hold. Resistive indices around 0.8 in both kidneys,
   which is slightly elevated, but given limited exam, may be unreliable.
   -The patient was not able to receive Zaroxylin as as she was noted to
   be coughing on a swab, very high risk of aspiration.  She continued on
   Lasix infusion at the rate of 20, but became hypotensive and rate had
   to be lowered to 10.
   This AM, the patient is unable to state whether her breathing has
   improved.  She reports pain in her back and R side [**7-11**] in intensity.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. She is currently receiving diuretic therapy with Lasix and is being treated for suspected pneumonia. Her laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. She is also experiencing hypoxia, which is being managed with oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and pulmonary edema increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and hypotension may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Renal complications: The patient's renal insufficiency and diuretic therapy may lead to further renal damage or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's suspected pneumonia and malnutrition increase her risk of developing secondary infections.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen her overall health and increase her risk of developing complications.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of cancer increase her risk of developing thrombotic complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen her overall health and increase her risk of developing complications.
8. Cutaneous candidiasis: The patient's intertriginal erythema may worsen and increase her risk of developing cutaneous candidiasis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue aggressive diuretic therapy, monitor her response to treatment, and address any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The 82-year-old woman was admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress. She has been treated with Lasix, and her renal ultrasound preliminary results showed no hydronephrosis. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/44 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 100%. Her respiratory support includes a medium concentration mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals normal breath sounds with crackles in about half of her lung fields. She has bilateral lower extremity edema, but her skin is warm, and her neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 97 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen is 23 mEq/L. Other lab results include calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels within normal ranges.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral symmetric infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are worse than prior studies.

The assessment and plan for the patient include:

1. Respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS.
2. The patient is being treated for incipient respiratory failure, and the differential diagnosis includes CHF, infection, acute renal failure, malnutrition, hypernatremia, abnormal LFTs, and thrombocytopenia.
3. The patient is receiving aggressive CHF therapy, and if not markedly improved, will be empirically treated for influenza, HCAP, and PCP.
4. The patient is at risk for PE, but radiographic opacities argue against this diagnosis.
5. The patient has acute renal failure, which is being monitored, and may require TPN if enteric feeding is not possible.
6. The patient has abnormal LFTs, and a liver biopsy has been performed. Hepatology consultation is being sought.
7. The patient has thrombocytopenia, and hematology consultation is being sought.
8. The patient is being monitored for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, which can spread to other parts of her body.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition can worsen, leading to muscle wasting, weakness, and decreased immune function.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia can worsen, leading to seizures, brain damage, and death.
6. Abnormal LFTs: The patient's abnormal LFTs can worsen, leading to liver failure, bleeding, and death.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to bleeding, petechiae, and purpura.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her various medical conditions."

   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.  Differential diagnosis
   at this point includes infectious pneumonia, bacterial or viral, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 10190**] heart failure, third spacing due to malnutrition into lungs,
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Also consider Wegener

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema, who was intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure and hypoxia. She has a broad differential diagnosis, including infectious pneumonia, PCP, heart failure, third spacing due to malnutrition, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She is being treated with empiric antibiotics and antifungals, and bronchoscopy with BAL is planned today. The patient's hypotension is likely related to recent intubation, initiation of sedation, and intravascular depletion. She has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypothyroidism, and is being treated with levothyroxine IV. She also has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and cutaneous candidiasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and further deterioration is possible.
2. Sepsis: The patient's underlying medical conditions, such as malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema, increase her risk of developing sepsis.
3. Heart failure: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases her risk of developing heart failure.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration is possible.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, malnutrition, or other underlying conditions.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, malnutrition, or other underlying conditions.
7. Cutaneous candidiasis: The patient's cutaneous candidiasis may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue empiric antibiotics and antifungals, and consider adding additional antibiotics or antifungals as necessary.
3. Consider bronchoscopy with BAL to further evaluate the patient's respiratory status.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Consider adding medications to treat anemia, thrombocytopenia, and cutaneous candidiasis as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Consider adding medications to treat atrial fibrillation as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.
   - Continue vent settings
   - Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 2601**]/Cefepime/Cipro and
   IV Bactrim
   - Have dc
ed droplet precautions
   - Urine legionella Ag negative
   - FU respiratory culture
   - [**Name9 (PRE) **] today
   - Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated
   troponins due to renal failure
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.   Urine lytes
   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, possibly related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   -Hold all rate control meds for now while diuresing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.
   - Continue vent settings
   - Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 2601**]/Cefepime/Cipro and
   IV Bactrim
   - Have dc
ed droplet precautions
   - Urine legionella Ag negative
   - FU respiratory culture
   - [**Name9 (PRE) **] today
   - Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated
   troponins due to renal failure
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.   Urine lytes
   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, possibly related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   -Hold all rate control meds for now while diuresing

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 82-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. She has a history of severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. She was intubated due to desaturation on NRB and was diagnosed with respiratory failure/hypoxia. The patient has a broad differential diagnosis, including pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic dysfunction, and acute renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin-T levels, which may be due to renal failure
* Anemia of chronic disease
* Thrombocytopenia, possibly related to poor nutritional status
* Elevated LDH levels, which may indicate a relapse of B-cell lymphoma

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Crackles to apices bilaterally
* Obese with soft, non-tender abdomen
* Diffuse 4+ pitting edema in the lower extremities
* Peripheral pulses palpable

The patient's medications include:

* Fentanyl for pain management
* Midazolam for sedation
* Heparin for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis
* Famotidine for gastroesophageal reflux disease
* Lasix for diuresis
* Morphine sulfate for pain management
* Bactrim for PCP treatment
* Cefepime and Cipro for HAP treatment
* Vancomycin for empiric coverage

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue vent settings
* Continue empiric coverage for HCAP and PCP
* Discontinue droplet precautions
* Follow up with respiratory culture
* Initiate TPN if patient is not a candidate for Dobhoff tube
* Trend HCT and thrombocytopenia
* Follow up with oncology recommendations
* Continue levothyroxine IV
* Continue miconazole powder for intertriginal erythema

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure/hypoxia
* Acute kidney injury due to diuresis
* Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding
* Anemia-related fatigue and decreased oxygen delivery
* Hypothyroidism-related symptoms such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and dry skin
* B-cell lymphoma relapse
* Cutaneous candidiasis-related skin infections
* Hypertension-related cardiovascular complications
* Atrial fibrillation-related arrhythmias"
