   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-ol woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Differential includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac
   vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion.  No hypoxia to suggest
   PE, and had a negative CTA in the ED.  CVP zero currently argues
   against cardiogenic shock.  She did recently finish her steroid taper
   and could be adrenally insufficient.  Fortunately she received
   dexamethasone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim could be evaluated.  Another possibility is
   volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
   Most likely this is sepsis.  Most likely source is urine given positive
   urine culture and indwelling Foley.   Recently had a UTI as an
   outpatient but no culture data or information about abx course.  Last
   positive UA here [**9-30**] and [**7-31**] with resistant klebsiella (ESBL) which
   was treated with Bactrim, and enterococcus (VRE) respectively.
   - Trend lactate
   - SvO2 as she comes off pressors
   - Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
   - trend lactate
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   - Source localization (pan-culture)
   - Continue levophed MAP >60
   - IVF to keep CVP >8 ([**9-3**])
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - change Foley
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:  Attributed to seizures by her husband and apparently
   by her neuro-oncologist, who recently increased her Keppra dosing to
   control this.  Another possibility is that she is simply
   orthostatic(given that episodes are reproducible with positional
   changes) and in the setting of worsening baseline hypotension recently
   has become more symptomatic.  CT head negative for acute change.
   - discuss with neuro-oncology if EEG monitorring might be helpful
   - check orthostatic vital signs once off pressors
   .
   # R thigh hematoma:  concerning given that she is currently on lovenox
   and hct dropped.
   - stop anticoagulation
   - follow Hct, repeat now
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  currently anticoagulated with lovenox.  Currently has
   evidence of R thigh bleed on CT.
   - stop anticoagulation for now
   - consider LENIs, as she may be a candidate for IVC filter if LE clots
   are present and anticoagulation contraindicated
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, improved to 14 after fluids and
   resuscitation. Likely secondary to elevated lactate (8.0).
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Reportedly with good response.  Although
   patient attributes her episodes to seizures, these are quite possibly
   just orthostatic symptoms.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

   .
   #) F/E/N:  NPO for now, advance diet in AM
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  SC heparin, bowel regimen as needed

   #) Communication:  with patient and husband [**Name (NI) **]:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4496**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, was admitted to the ICU with hypotension. She has a positive urine culture and an indwelling Foley catheter, which may be the source of sepsis. She also has a thigh hematoma, which may be related to her anticoagulation therapy with lovenox. Other concerns include an anion gap, elevated troponin, and a history of DVT/PE. The patient is receiving antibiotics, vanc and zosyn, and is being treated with stress dose steroids. She is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin SC.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and positive urine culture suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Thigh hematoma: The patient's thigh hematoma may be related to her anticoagulation therapy and may require surgical intervention.
3. DVT/PE: The patient's history of DVT/PE and current anticoagulation therapy with lovenox may increase her risk of bleeding.
4. Anion gap: The patient's anion gap may indicate metabolic acidosis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Elevated troponin: The patient's elevated troponin may indicate cardiac injury or stress, which can lead to cardiac complications.
6. CNS lymphoma: The patient's history of CNS lymphoma may increase her risk of seizures and other neurological complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.   However,
   relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal insufficiency
   still possible given recent completion of steroid taper. CTA negative
   for PE.  Sepsis still most likely, urine is one obvious culprit, but R
   thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL klebsiella and
   [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.  Foley has been
   changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind this morning in
   that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - restart Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider LENI, although unlikely to affect management as no evidence
   of PE and thus no indication for IVC filter
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, likely secondary to elevated lactate
   (8.0), now resolved..
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - completed decadron taper; consider stress-dose steroids PRN adrenal
   insufficiency
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management
   <br>
   .
   #) F/E/N:  restart regular diet (tolerates at home per husband,
   aggressive electrolyte repletion
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  SC heparin, bowel regimen as needed

   #) Communication:  with patient and husband [**Name (NI) **]:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4496**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, who presents with hypotension and is currently being managed in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and she is receiving oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 206 K/uL. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk of developing shock.
2. Lactate acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may indicate a metabolic acidosis.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, and her white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
5. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may indicate cardiac injury or stress.
6. Anion gap: The patient's anion gap is elevated, which may indicate a metabolic acidosis.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, zosyn, and ativan, which may help to manage her infections and symptoms. She is also receiving IV fluids and oxygen therapy to support her blood pressure and respiratory function.

In conclusion, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, who presents with hypotension and is at risk of developing a number of medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications, and to support her overall health and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-ol woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Differential includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac
   vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion.  No hypoxia to suggest
   PE, and had a negative CTA in the ED.  CVP zero currently argues
   against cardiogenic shock.  She did recently finish her steroid taper
   and could be adrenally insufficient.  Fortunately she received
   dexamethasone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim could be evaluated.  Another possibility is
   volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
   Most likely this is sepsis.  Most likely source is urine given positive
   urine culture and indwelling Foley.   Recently had a UTI as an
   outpatient but no culture data or information about abx course.  Last
   positive UA here [**9-30**] and [**7-31**] with resistant klebsiella (ESBL) which
   was treated with Bactrim, and enterococcus (VRE) respectively.
   - Trend lactate

   - Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
   - trend lactate

   - Source localization (pan-culture)
   - Continue levophed MAP >60
   - IVF to keep CVP >8 ([**9-3**])
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - change Foley
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:  Attributed to seizures by her husband and apparently
   by her neuro-oncologist, who recently increased her Keppra dosing to
   control this.  Another possibility is that she is simply
   orthostatic(given that episodes are reproducible with positional
   changes) and in the setting of worsening baseline hypotension recently
   has become more symptomatic.  CT head negative for acute change.
   - discuss with neuro-oncology if EEG monitorring might be helpful
   - check orthostatic vital signs once off pressors
   .
   # R thigh hematoma:  concerning given that she is currently on lovenox
   and hct dropped.
   - stop anticoagulation
   - follow Hct, repeat now
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  currently anticoagulated with lovenox.  Currently has
   evidence of R thigh bleed on CT.
   - stop anticoagulation for now
   - consider LENIs, as she may be a candidate for IVC filter if LE clots
   are present and anticoagulation contraindicated
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, improved to 14 after fluids and
   resuscitation. Likely secondary to elevated lactate (8.0).
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Reportedly with good response.  Although
   patient attributes her episodes to seizures, these are quite possibly
   just orthostatic symptoms.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion. The patient has recently finished her steroid taper and may be adrenally insufficient. The most likely source of sepsis is the urine, given the positive urine culture and indwelling Foley catheter.

The patient has also experienced episodes of loss of consciousness (LOC), which may be attributed to seizures or orthostatic hypotension. The CT head is negative for acute change, and the patient is currently on keppra to control seizures.

The patient has a right thigh hematoma, which is concerning given her current anticoagulation with lovenox and her low hemoglobin level. The patient is also anticoagulated with lovenox for a history of DVT/PE.

The patient has an anion gap of 14, which is likely secondary to elevated lactate levels. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but with a flat CK, suggesting demand and hypotension.

The patient is currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation and has reportedly had a good response. However, the patient attributes her episodes to seizures, which may be orthostatic symptoms.

The patient's current medications include keppra, modafinil, citalopram, and stress dose steroids. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, vanc + zosyn, pending cultures.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction or failure
2. Adrenal insufficiency
3. Cardiac compromise or failure
4. Volume depletion or shock
5. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding complications
6. Increased risk of infection due to indwelling Foley catheter
7. Orthostatic hypotension or syncope
8. Compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis due to thigh hematoma
9. Increased risk of DVT/PE due to anticoagulation with lovenox
10. Metabolic acidosis or anion gap metabolic acidosis due to elevated lactate levels.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Trend lactate levels
2. SvO2 monitoring as she comes off pressors
3. Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
4. Trend cardiac enzymes
5. Repeat EKG in AM
6. Stop anticoagulation with lovenox
7. Consider IVC filter if LE clots are present and anticoagulation is contraindicated
8. Monitor for signs of compartment syndrome
9. Continue stress dose steroids
10. Advance diet in AM."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.
   Possible sources:  proctitis, effusion, thigh
   However, relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal
   insufficiency still possible given recent completion of steroid taper.
   CTA negative for PE.  Sepsis still most likely given that leukocytosis
   with left shift improved with antibiotics, urine is one obvious
   culprit, but R thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL
   klebsiella and [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.
   Foley has been changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind
   this morning in that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be posibitve
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - restart Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider LENI, although unlikely to affect management as no evidence
   of PE and thus no indication for IVC filter
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, likely secondary to elevated lactate
   (8.0), now resolved..
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - completed decadron taper; consider stress-dose steroids PRN adrenal
   insufficiency
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.
   Possible sources:  proctitis, effusion, thigh
   However, relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal
   insufficiency still possible given recent completion of steroid taper.
   CTA negative for PE.  Sepsis still most likely given that leukocytosis
   with left shift improved with antibiotics, urine is one obvious
   culprit, but R thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL
   klebsiella and [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.
   Foley has been changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind
   this morning in that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be posibitve
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - restart Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider LENI, although unlikely to affect management as no evidence
   of PE and thus no indication for IVC filter
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, likely secondary to elevated lactate
   (8.0), now resolved..
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - completed decadron taper; consider stress-dose steroids PRN adrenal
   insufficiency
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management
   <br>
   .
   #) F/E/N:  restart regular diet (tolerates at home per husband,
   aggressive electrolyte repletion

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation. She presents with hypotension, falling hematocrit, and a probable hematoma in the right buttock and right obturator externus muscle. The patient has been anticoagulated with lovenox for a history of DVT/PE and has been restarted on anticoagulation yesterday.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with an O2 delivery device set to room air. Her physical examination reveals a well-appearing patient, with no signs of distress or respiratory compromise.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 149 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 140 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and chloride level of 110 mg/dL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 16 mEq/L, and her creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a probable hematoma in the right buttock and right obturator externus muscle, as well as a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Her CT torso also shows diffuse osteopenia with generalized body wall atrophy, mild rectal wall thickening, and a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Falling hematocrit, likely due to bleeding or anticoagulation
* Hypotension, likely due to sepsis, blood loss, or adrenal insufficiency
* Probable source of sepsis is the indwelling Foley catheter or the questionable mass in the right obturator hematoma
* Continue vancomycin and Zosyn antibiotics
* Repeat urine culture, although unlikely to be positive
* Monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, and repeat CT to evaluate for interval progression of hematoma
* Monitor for signs of compartment syndrome

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hemorrhagic shock due to continued bleeding from the right thigh hematoma
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or respiratory failure
* Adrenal insufficiency, which could worsen hypotension
* Infection of the right obturator hematoma or questionable mass
* Recurrent DVT/PE due to continued anticoagulation
* Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to continued large-volume fluid resuscitation
* Elevated troponin levels, which may indicate cardiac damage or demand

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications, including continued monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies."

   still the most likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on
   admission.  Repeat UA has expectedly  been negative given antibiotics.
   Her proctitis visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if
   infectious.  Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or
   the questionable mass could be a source.  She has been on vancomycin
   and zosyn and improving, so it would be difficult to stop abx at this
   time, although unclear exactly what we
re treating.  Furthermore, Zosyn
   may be contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - continue vancomycin
   - change Zosyn to meropenem
   - f/u all pending cultures
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >35 cc/h

   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:  On repeat CT yesterday, mass has not
   enlarged.  However, it is substantial in size.
   - monitor hct
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - discuss with radiology whether this is a true bleed (vs underlying
   mass?)  and how significant it is
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Anticoagulation stopped yesterday out of
   concern for bleed.  Hct bumped appropriately to 1 unit pRBC and has
   remained stable.   Also complains of mild abdominal pain (? Upper GI
   source).
   - hold anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin since admit (on and off)
   but had been on lovenox chronically, so HIT less likely.  Fibrinogen
   was somewhat low last time it was checked 2 days ago.
   - check DIC labs
   - replete fibrinogen with cryo PRN
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - LENIs
   - discuss re-challenge with heparin vs possible IVC filter given
   ongoing risk for VTE and possible contra-indication to anticoagulation
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - LR boluses
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

* The patient, a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, sepsis, and a right obturator hematoma.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/67 mmHg.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% and a respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute.
* The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 1 mmHg, indicating a low CVP.
* The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,082 mL, with a total output of 1,370 mL, resulting in a net positive balance of 3,712 mL.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 25.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 108 x 10^9/L.
* The patient's imaging studies show a slight increase in size of the hematoma in the pelvis, with a questionable mass not excluded.
* The patient's pain is controlled with morphine sulfate, and her sepsis is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding from the hematoma: The patient's CVP is low, indicating a risk of bleeding from the hematoma.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being treated with antibiotics, but the source of the sepsis is still unclear, and the patient may require further treatment.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to DIC or HIT.
4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may be related to the large volume of normal saline resuscitation.
5. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may be related to demand and hypotension.
6. CNS lymphoma: The patient's history of CNS lymphoma may be relevant to her current condition, and further management may be needed to address this.
7. VTE: The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is at risk for recurrent VTE, which may require anticoagulation and/or an IVC filter.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and address potential complications."

 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off pressors x 3 days and able to maintain MAP
   mostly >70 with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple
   boluses and good UOP.  Regarding cause, no evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but
   blood loss also high on the differential for her hypotension.
   Regarding source of sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably
   still the most likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on
   admission.  Repeat UA has expectedly  been negative given antibiotics.
   Her proctitis visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if
   infectious.  Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or
   the questionable mass could be a source.  She has been on vancomycin
   and zosyn and improving, so it would be difficult to stop abx at this
   time, although unclear exactly what we
re treating.  Furthermore, Zosyn
   may be contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - continue vancomycin
   - change Zosyn to meropenem
   - f/u all pending cultures
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >35 cc/h
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:  On repeat CT yesterday, mass has not
   enlarged.  However, it is substantial in size.
   - monitor hct
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - discuss with radiology whether this is a true bleed (vs underlying
   mass?)  and how significant it is
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Anticoagulation stopped yesterday out of
   concern for bleed.  Hct bumped appropriately to 1 unit pRBC and has
   remained stable.   Also complains of mild abdominal pain (? Upper GI
   source).
   - hold anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin since admit (on and off)
   but had been on lovenox chronically, so HIT less likely.  Fibrinogen
   was somewhat low last time it was checked 2 days ago.
   - check DIC labs
   - replete fibrinogen with cryo PRN
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - LENIs
   - discuss re-challenge with heparin vs possible IVC filter given
   ongoing risk for VTE and possible contra-indication to anticoagulation
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - LR boluses
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - echo today to evaluate cardiac function
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management
   <br>
   .
   #) F/E/N:  regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension, sepsis, and a R thigh hematoma.
* The patient has been treated with antibiotics, and her condition has been improving.
* The patient has been on pressors for three days and is now able to maintain a MAP greater than 70 with IVF boluses.
* The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for recurrent DVT.
* The patient has a R thigh hematoma, which has not enlarged on repeat CT, but is substantial in size.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to DIC or HIT.
* The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to large volume of NS resuscitation.
* The patient has elevated troponin levels, which are likely secondary to demand and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding from the R thigh hematoma, which may be exacerbated by anticoagulation therapy.
* Recurrent DVT, which may be related to the patient's history of PE and DVT.
* Thrombocytopenia, which may be related to DIC or HIT.
* Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
* Elevated troponin levels, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction.
* CNS lymphoma, which may recur or progress if not properly managed.

Recommendations for further management include:

* Continuing vancomycin and changing Zosyn to meropenem.
* Monitoring the patient's hematocrit and platelet count.
* Holding anticoagulation therapy until further evaluation of the R thigh hematoma.
* Considering the use of an IVC filter or re-challenging with heparin.
* Continuing IVF to maintain MAP greater than 65 and CVP greater than 8.
* Monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome in the R thigh.
* Evaluating the patient's cardiac function with an echocardiogram.
* Continuing seizure prophylaxis with keppra.
* Continuing modafinil and citalopram.
* Discussing further management with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**]."

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, presenting with hypotension, pelvic hematoma, and suspected sepsis. The patient has been anticoagulated with lovenox for a history of DVT/PE and has a known hematoma in her right thigh.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding from the hematoma: The patient's hematocrit is falling, and she has been anticoagulated with lovenox. Stopping anticoagulation and monitoring her hematocrit closely is essential to prevent further bleeding.
2. Infection of the hematoma: The patient's right thigh hematoma could be infected, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely secondary to a urinary tract infection, but other sources such as the proctitis visualized on CT or the questionable mass in her right obturator region cannot be ruled out.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, which could be related to large-volume resuscitation with normal saline.
6. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which could be secondary to demand and hypotension, but further evaluation is necessary to rule out cardiac damage.
7. Compartment syndrome: The patient's right thigh hematoma could lead to compartment syndrome, which could require urgent surgical intervention.
8. Recurrent DVT: The patient has a history of DVT/PE and has a larger left leg edema compared to the right leg, which could indicate recurrent DVT.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, and the following measures should be taken:

* Stop anticoagulation and monitor her hematocrit closely.
* Repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of the hematoma.
* Monitor for signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome.
* Continue vancomycin and zosyn for sepsis.
* Trend cardiac enzymes and repeat EKG in the morning.
* Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis and modafinil for sleep apnea.
* Discuss further management with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**]."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin intermittently.
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, presenting with hypotension, acute pain, chronic pain, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and potential bleeding from a hematoma. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 107/67 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 12 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and she is on room air. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 1 mmHg, and her total fluid input is 5,082 mL, with an output of 1,370 mL. 

The patient has a slight increase in the size of the hematoma in the pelvis, as seen on the CT scan, and has a history of DVT and PE. She is on anticoagulation therapy, which has been re-started yesterday. 

The patient's laboratory results show a hematocrit of 25.4%, platelet count of 167,000, and white blood cell count of 12.0. Her creatinine is 0.5 mg/dL, and her troponin-T is 0.13 ng/mL. 

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding from the hematoma: Given the patient's anticoagulation therapy and the slight increase in the size of the hematoma, there is a concern for bleeding from the hematoma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, and the source of sepsis is uncertain. The patient has a contaminated urine culture, and there is a possibility of proctitis or infected hematoma.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for DIC or HIT.
4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, and it is likely secondary to large volume of NS resuscitation.
5. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin-T is elevated, and it is likely secondary to demand and hypotension.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Stop anticoagulation therapy and monitor the patient's hematocrit.
2. Repeat CT scan to evaluate for interval progression of the hematoma.
3. Check guaiac stools and hemolysis labs.
4. Continue vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis.
5. Repeat urine culture, although unlikely to be positive.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure, CVP, and urine output.
7. Trend cardiac enzymes and repeat EKG in the morning.
8. Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis and modafinil and citalopram for other medications.
9. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
10. Discuss further management with Dr. [Last Name] and the patient's husband."
