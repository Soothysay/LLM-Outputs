   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety
   and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with
   increasing paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.
   # FEN: IV NS@150cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. Overnight, he experienced several episodes of tachycardia, but his EKG remained unchanged. His fever has improved, and his rigidity has improved with Ativan. His mental status has also improved, with reduced paranoia and mutism.

Lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.6-13.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 327-363 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55-79 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range
* Troponin-T: <0.1 ng/mL
* LDH: 281 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient will be monitored for signs of meningitis.
2. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): The patient's presentation, including fever, rigidity, and mental status changes, is concerning for NMS. However, his response to Ativan and lack of signs of meningitis make NMS less likely.
3. Malignant Catatonia: The patient's mental status changes, including catatonia and mutism, are concerning for malignant catatonia. His response to Ativan and lack of signs of meningitis make malignant catatonia a possible diagnosis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's new murmur on exam suggests the possibility of cardiovascular complications, such as endocarditis or cardiomyopathy.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's IV fluids and medications may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent use of antipsychotic medications and IV fluids may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or nausea.

Assessment and plan:

The patient will continue to be monitored for signs of infection, NMS, and malignant catatonia. He will receive IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation as needed. His mental status will be closely monitored, and he will be treated with Ativan as needed. Blood and urine cultures will be repeated, and the patient will be followed up with psychiatry to determine the best course of treatment for his paranoia and anxiety."

   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presented with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. Overnight, he experienced several episodes of tachycardia, but his EKG remained unchanged. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg.

The patient has a few potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Malignant catatonia: The patient's presentation is concerning for malignant catatonia, a psychiatric diagnosis characterized by fever, rigidity, and mental status changes. The patient's improvement with Ativan suggests that this diagnosis is possible.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis make infection a possibility. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient will be monitored for signs of meningitis.
3. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): The patient's recent initiation of antipsychotic medications and his presentation with fever, rigidity, and tachycardia raise concerns for NMS.
4. Meningitis: The patient's new murmur on exam and his lack of meningeal signs on exam make meningitis a possibility.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of asthma and is currently stable on exam. However, he is at risk for respiratory complications, particularly given his recent initiation of antipsychotic medications.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Monitoring of his fever curve, WBC count, and mental status.
2. Repeat CBC and follow-up on pending cultures.
3. ETT to work-up the new murmur on exam.
4. Treatment with Ativan for malignant catatonia and NMS.
5. Monitoring of his electrolytes and blood glucose levels.
6. Regular diet as tolerated.
7. Restart of outpatient topical creams for eczema.
8. Monitoring of his PIV line and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ongoing respiratory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mild hyperglycemia. The patient's physical examination is limited due to lack of assessment of certain vital signs and body systems.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are receiving oxygen therapy, which may indicate underlying respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mild hyperglycemia, which may indicate underlying sepsis.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, which may indicate hypovolemia.
5. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, which may indicate underlying infection.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, which may indicate underlying gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may indicate underlying cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Consider administering antibiotics if the patient's laboratory results indicate sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and administer fluids as necessary to prevent hypovolemia.
4. Consider administering platelet transfusions to correct the patient's thrombocytopenia.
5. Consider administering blood transfusions to correct the patient's anemia.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider administering medications to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety
   and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with
   increasing paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - continue IV NS@ 100cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 2mg IV, would switch to PO today and decrease to [**Hospital1 **]
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved significantly since admission. Will touch base
   with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate
   follow-up and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given
   patient's discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal
   vs. new onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative
   with diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related
   given patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Would hold off giving albuterol
   standing as pt is still tachycardic.
   # FEN: IV NS@100cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # PPx:  heparin SC

   # Code:  presumed full

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - continue IV NS@ 100cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 2mg IV, would switch to PO today and decrease to [**Hospital1 **]
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved significantly since admission. Will touch base
   with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate
   follow-up and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given
   patient's discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal
   vs. new onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative
   with diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related
   given patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Would hold off giving albuterol

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. He has been treated with ativan and his rigidity has improved.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 136/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.6-13.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 35.3-42.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 327-363 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55-79 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/27.2/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 103//, LDH: 281 IU/L, Ca++: 9.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing IV NS at 100cc/hr
* Trending CK and lactate levels
* Switching to PO ativan and decreasing the dose
* Following up with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge
* Monitoring for signs of meningitis and infection
* Treating paranoia with benzodiazepines and avoiding neuroleptics
* Following up with pending cultures
* Working up a new murmur on exam

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Infection: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient will need to be monitored closely for signs of meningitis.
* Malignant catatonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, rigidity, and mental status changes may be indicative of malignant catatonia, a psychiatric diagnosis. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening mental status.
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): The patient's use of antipsychotic medications and symptoms of fever, rigidity, and mental status changes may indicate NMS. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening symptoms.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's new murmur on exam may indicate a cardiac complication. An echocardiogram or other cardiac testing may be necessary to determine the cause of the murmur.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate respiratory complications. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory status.

In conclusion, the patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are concerning for infection, malignant catatonia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening symptoms and treated accordingly."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including lorazepam, and has a history of allergies to aspirin. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% and no need for supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 327.

The patient's fluid balance is noted to be negative, with a total fluid intake of 360 mL and a total fluid output of 1,800 mL. The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 23 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also stable, with a sodium level of 142 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.6, which is elevated, and a C-reactive protein level of 281 IU/L, which is indicative of inflammation. This may indicate the presence of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's oxygen saturation is only 100%, which may indicate a degree of respiratory compromise. This may be due to underlying lung disease or the presence of pneumonia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen level is 23 mg/dL, which is also elevated. This may indicate the presence of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are stable, but the patient's potassium level is slightly elevated at 4.1 mEq/L. This may indicate the presence of hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated at 136/63 mmHg. This may indicate the presence of hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   23 year old male with asthma, eczema, recent development of anxiety and
   paranoia.
   Worsening paranoia after Seroquel, in combintation with rigid muscle
   tone, fevers, elevated BP's concerning for neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome vs malignant catatonia.
   Throughout the night, he has had intermittent worsening of increased
   tone/tachycardia despite scheduled Ativan. Recurrence at 4 am after
   getting 10 pm dose suggests that Ativan needs to be dosed in shorter
   intervals. Other measures such as CK's, fevers, QT by EKG have not been
   concerning.
   Plan:
   *Change to Ativan 2 mgIV or po Q6h and also q2 h prn
   *Increase volume resuscitation to 150 cc/hour
   *Continue monitoring of ECG's and lactate
   *Psych continuing to follow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of asthma, eczema, and recent development of anxiety and paranoia. He was started on Seroquel, which led to worsening paranoia, rigidity, and fevers. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to concerns of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant catatonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 126 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 143/60 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. His cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals increased rigidity, particularly in his lower extremities, with a normal cardiovascular examination. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. His extremities are warm, with no cyanosis or clubbing.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 13.3 g/dL. His white blood cell count is 12.6 K/uL, and his platelet count is 327 K/uL. His creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and his glucose level is 55 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include a diagnosis of worsening paranoia, rigidity, and fevers, likely due to NMS or malignant catatonia. The plan is to change the Ativan dosing to 2 mg IV or PO every 6 hours, with additional doses as needed. The patient will also receive increased volume resuscitation and continue to be monitored for ECG changes and lactate levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's increased respiratory rate and use of oxygen therapy may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's mild anemia and elevated creatinine level may increase the risk of renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's fevers and increased white blood cell count may increase the risk of infection.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's rigidity and increased tone may increase the risk of neurological complications, including seizures and stroke.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
   #. Paranoia
   #. Leukocytosis
   #. Asthma
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
   #. Paranoia
   #. Leukocytosis
   #. Asthma
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.

   tolerated

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F) with a Tmax of 37°C and a current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 99 bpm with a range of 72-161 bpm
* Blood pressure: 100/56 mmHg with a range of 68-166/120 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute with a range of 19-44 inspirations per minute

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Intermittent tachycardia
* Paranoia
* Leukocytosis
* Asthma

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 12.6, 13.1, and 11.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 35.3, 42.1, and 36.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 327, 363, and 311 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8, 0.7, and 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55, 79, and 109 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.7/28.6/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 103//, Albumin: 3.9 g/dL, LDH: 281 IU/L, Ca++: 9.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 4.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan is as follows:

* Fever, rigidity: Continue IV NS at 150cc/hr, trend CK and lactate, and continue ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN, and 1mg IV PRN.
* Paranoia: Continue treatment with benzos, avoid neuroleptics, and follow up with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge.
* Leukocytosis: Repeat CBC, follow up pending cultures, and ETT to work-up new murmur on exam.
* Asthma: Continue treatment with albuterol/fluticasone IH and monitor for signs of worsening asthma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Meningitis: Given the patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, meningitis is a possible diagnosis.
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): The patient's symptoms, including fever, rigidity, and tachycardia, are consistent with NMS.
* Seizures: The patient's history of anxiety and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications increase the risk of seizures.
* Infection: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infection.
* Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is slightly low, which can increase the risk of muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is slightly low, which can increase the risk of muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and mental status to ensure that these potential complications are addressed promptly and effectively."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, stiffness, and paranoia. The patient had an episode of tachycardia up to 160 with a systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg, which did not respond to ativan, but was stabilized with lorazepam. The patient has been receiving metoprolol and lorazepam infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's neurologic examination is limited due to the patient's agitation and inability to assess peripheral pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's episode of tachycardia and the presence of metoprolol infusion increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's oxygen saturation drops.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's paranoia and agitation may be indicative of a neurologic complication, such as encephalitis or meningitis, which can lead to long-term cognitive impairment or even death.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if the patient undergoes invasive procedures.
6. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's hyperglycemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may indicate metabolic complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis, which can be life-threatening.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical status to identify potential complications and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
 Sinus tachycardia to 160 last night.
   Unclear etiology.  Per psychiatry, unlikely NMS. Possible malignant
   catatonia which can be associated with autonomic dysfunction. No
   indication of infection. Thyroid function is normal. BUN/creatinine
   does not support that he is dry. Negative tox screen on admission.
   Given beta-blocker last night. As unclear of etiology, will hold off on
   further beta-blocker until hemodynamically unstable.
   -          Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   -          Beta-blocker if tachycardia and hemodynamically unstable.
   -          Ativan standing and prn for anxiety related tachycardia
   -          Encourage good PO intake
   #. Paranoia
 Per psychiatry, patient likely needs to be on
   antipsychotic
 still with paranoia, occasional agitation. Psychiatry
   would like to try Seroquel once again while in hospital
   -          Start Seroquel at low-dose today
   -          Ativan 4mg Q6 standing + Ativan prn with hold parameters
   -          Touch base regarding transfer to psychiatry
   -          Follow-up psychiatry recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis
 Unclear origin. Afebrile since admission to ICU;
   febrile to 100.8 in ED. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures with no
   growth to this point. NMS can be associated with mild leukocytosis;
   unsure if this is the same with malignant catatonia.
   -          Trend WBC count and fever curves
   -          Continue to follow blood, urine, and sputum cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, presenting with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. He experienced intermittent tachycardia, with a rate of 160 beats per minute (bpm) last night, which responded to lorazepam. The patient's paranoia persists, and psychiatry recommends restarting antipsychotic medication. The patient has leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 12.6 K/uL, but is afebrile since admission to the ICU. His blood, urine, and sputum cultures have no growth to this point.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignant Catatonia: The patient's presentation with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness, along with his recent initiation of antipsychotic medications, raises concerns about malignant catatonia. This condition can be associated with autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, and potential cardiovascular complications.
2. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Although psychiatry considers NMS unlikely, the patient's symptoms, including tachycardia and leukocytosis, warrant close monitoring for potential NMS.
3. Infection: The patient's febrile episode and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an underlying infection. The lack of growth on blood, urine, and sputum cultures to this point does not rule out the possibility of a slow-growing or resistant infection.
4. Thyroid Dysfunction: The patient's normal thyroid function tests do not rule out the possibility of subclinical thyroid dysfunction, which could contribute to his symptoms.
5. Autonomic Dysfunction: The patient's tachycardia and potential malignant catatonia raise concerns about autonomic dysfunction, which could lead to cardiovascular complications.
6. Dehydration: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and potential autonomic dysfunction increase the risk of dehydration.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's recent initiation of antipsychotic medications and potential autonomic dysfunction increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
8. Skin Complications: The patient's dry, flaky skin diffusely raises concerns about potential skin complications, such as pressure ulcers or skin infections.

Based on the patient's presentation and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and medication therapy."
