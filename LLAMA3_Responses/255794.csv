You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. She presented with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA). She has been experiencing hypotension, requiring multiple boluses of normal saline, and has a history of allergies to certain medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/74 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination is notable for a pale conjunctiva, hyperdynamic cardiovascular examination, and diminished breath sounds on the left side.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a saddle PE, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to the PE, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's diminished breath sounds on the left side and hypotension may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hyperdynamic cardiovascular examination and history of metastatic NSCLC increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's history of allergies and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding complications related to anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Metastatic Spread: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of brain metastases and radiation therapy may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, cognitive decline, and motor dysfunction."

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases, who presented to the emergency department with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. She was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA), with some findings consistent with right ventricular strain on electrocardiogram (EKG) and physical exam. The patient is currently receiving heparin IV without a bolus, and telemetry monitoring has been initiated. An echocardiogram has been ordered to evaluate for significant right ventricular strain or right atrial or right ventricular clot. A lower extremity ultrasound has also been ordered to evaluate for high clot burden.

The patient has a history of brain irradiation and is planned to receive cyberknife treatment. She has received a 15-day course of Navelbine treatment, with the last dose given on October 8th.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 152 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated troponin level of 0.09 ng/mL, which is likely related to the PE.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, but is anxious and diaphoretic. Her respiratory examination shows diminished breath sounds on the left side, and her cardiovascular examination reveals a hyperdynamic heart rhythm with a loud S2 sound.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for developing DVT and PE due to her history of cancer and prolonged immobility.
2. Right Ventricular Strain: The patient's physical examination and EKG findings suggest right ventricular strain, which may increase her risk of developing right ventricular failure and other cardiac complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's diminished breath sounds on the left side may indicate a risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly if she develops a left-sided pneumonia or pleural effusion.
4. Infection: The patient's history of cancer and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing an infection, particularly in the lungs, urinary tract, or bloodstream.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of hyperglycemia and use of steroids may increase her risk of developing hyperglycemic emergencies, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of electrolyte imbalance and use of diuretics may increase her risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypercalcemia.
7. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of palpitations and use of heparin may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status and shortness of breath, requiring three liters of normal saline in multiple boluses due to hypotension. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and has received antibiotics. Vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 92/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished, anxious, and diaphoretic, with pale conjunctiva and diminished breath sounds on the left side. The patient has a history of muscle wasting and is oriented to time, place, and person.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for multiple boluses of normal saline suggest the possibility of septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's diminished breath sounds on the left side and oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hyperdynamic cardiovascular examination may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's decreased blood pressure and increased creatinine level may indicate renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of antibiotics and the presence of a wound or other potential sources of infection increase the risk of infection.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and muscle wasting may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of prophylaxis for stress ulcer and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of stress ulcer.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's history of prophylaxis for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with h/o HTN and NSCCA-Lung with brain/spine mets with
   altered mental status and tachycardia at initial presentation.  This
   was in a relative absence of associated symptoms limited only to dry
   cough.  Patient at [**Hospital3 981**] with tachycardia and then transferred
   to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care.  Here she was identified with significant
   pulmonary embolism and after extended discussion with oncology team and
   clinical decision making with patient heparin was started for
   anticoagulation.
   1)Pulmonary Embolism-Documented on CTA, is leading diagnosis for
   tachycardia and tachypnea
   -Heparin with goal PTT 60-80
   -Follow up coags closely
   -Will have to decide with oncology team long term anticoagulation with
   Coumadin vs. Lovenox
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Will pursue LENI study only if anticoagulation remains difficult to
   maintain.
   -She has persistent tachycardia and tachypnea which would be expected
   to resolve over first 72-96 hours borrowing from our understanding of
   UPET data from lysis trials, what may be encouraging is that her CVP
   has shown a decrease by physical exam although this may represent in
   adquate filling volume.
   -Will utilize ECHO to evaluate RV function and relative volume status
   in the setting of persistent tachycardia.
   2)Lung Cancer-[**Month (only) 8**] well have been risk factor for thrombo-embolism
   -Continue supportive Rx
   -Will discuss treatment timing implications with oncology team
   -Continue dexamethasone

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo female with h/o HTN and NSCCA-Lung with brain/spine mets with
   altered mental status and tachycardia at initial presentation.  This
   was in a relative absence of associated symptoms limited only to dry
   cough.  Patient at [**Hospital3 981**] with tachycardia and then transferred
   to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care.  Here she was identified with significant
   pulmonary embolism and after extended discussion with oncology team and
   clinical decision making with patient heparin was started for
   anticoagulation.
   1)Pulmonary Embolism-Documented on CTA, is leading diagnosis for
   tachycardia and tachypnea
   -Heparin with goal PTT 60-80
   -Follow up coags closely
   -Will have to decide with oncology team long term anticoagulation with
   Coumadin vs. Lovenox
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Will pursue LENI study only if anticoagulation remains difficult to
   maintain.
   -She has persistent tachycardia and tachypnea which would be expected
   to resolve over first 72-96 hours borrowing from our understanding of
   UPET data from lysis trials, what may be encouraging is that her CVP
   has shown a decrease by physical exam although this may represent in
   adquate filling volume.
   -Will utilize ECHO to evaluate RV function and relative volume status
   in the setting of persistent tachycardia.
   2)Lung Cancer-[**Month (only) 8**] well have been risk factor for thrombo-embolism
   -Continue supportive Rx
   -Will discuss treatment timing implications with oncology team
   -Continue dexamethasone

Summary:

The patient, a 68-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a pulmonary embolus, altered mental status, and tachycardia. She has a history of hypertension, non-small cell lung cancer with brain and spine metastases, and was previously treated with antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 122 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/60 mmHg. She is receiving heparin for anticoagulation and has a central thrombus with extension to the right and left main pulmonary arteries.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and tachycardia may lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Pulmonary hemorrhage: The patient's pulmonary embolus may lead to pulmonary hemorrhage, especially if anticoagulation is not adequate.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's central thrombus may extend to the deep veins, leading to deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
5. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA): The patient's brain metastases and pulmonary embolus may increase the risk of stroke or TIA.
6. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and tachycardia may indicate sepsis, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if not monitored closely.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and chemotherapy may increase the risk of renal failure, especially if not managed promptly.
9. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and altered mental status may increase the risk of infection, especially if not managed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases, presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. She was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and was started on a heparin drip. Her blood pressure has improved with fluid boluses, but she remains at high risk for bleeding due to her metastatic disease. The patient is not a candidate for surgery or thrombolytic therapy. She is currently receiving oxygen therapy and is stable, with a SpO2 of 95%. Her urine output is 25 cc/hr, and she is producing 555 mL of urine over the past 24 hours.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at high risk for bleeding due to her metastatic disease and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her PE, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure.

   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2126-10-22**] 10:34 AM
   Discussion yesterday with oncology, came to conclusion that risk of PE
   untreated was higher than risk of intracranial bleed, so started on
   heparin drip
   - o2 requirements stable [**10-22**], BP 90=> 80s
   Blood pressure much improved yesterday now in 130s systolic with fluid
   boluses.
   - didn't start antibiotics b/c could explain bands and shift with PE
   - chest x-ray unchanged
   - not candidate for surgery or tpa due to metastatic disease and likely
   at high risk to bleed
   - son is apparently reasonable about code status, however patient still
   wanting to be full code, will need to continue to readdress
   - urine output currently putting out 25 cc/hr
   - echo: MPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary
   artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
   - written for diet
   - lovenox when she is stable per onc (lovenox shot then 4-6 hours later
   can d/c heparin - NOT YET)
   - onc - no plans to restart chemo right now, or maybe not at all in the
   future
   - got addition 500 cc at 9:30 pm for low urine output - JVP not
   markedly elevated, crackels at the left base

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. She was admitted to the ICU with a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and palpitations. She has been receiving heparin drip therapy and oxygen supplementation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/86 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient has a history of lung cancer, which has been treated with brain irradiation and chemotherapy. However, the patient's oncologist has indicated that there are no plans for further chemotherapy at this time.

The patient's lab results show evidence of right ventricular strain, with an elevated troponin level and an abnormal ECG. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a mild anemia and a low platelet count.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tachypneic patient with crackles at the left base of her lungs. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm.

The patient has a code status of full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has already developed a saddle PE, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Right ventricular failure: The patient's right ventricular strain and hypokinesis may lead to right ventricular failure, which can be fatal.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, but may drop if her right ventricular function worsens.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and crackles at the left base of her lungs may indicate respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
5. Sepsis: The patient's low platelet count and elevated troponin level may indicate a risk of sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's abnormal ECG and elevated troponin level may indicate a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and her low platelet count may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
8. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count and elevated troponin level may indicate a risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage her care accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her outcomes."

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2126-10-22**] 10:34 AM
   This morning, patient without complaints. Denies chest pain, abdominal
   pain, or difficulty breathing. Patient appears more comfortable
   breathing than yesterday morning.
   Discussion yesterday with oncology, came to conclusion that risk of PE
   untreated was higher than risk of intracranial bleed, so started on
   heparin drip
   - o2 requirements stable [**10-22**], BP 90=> 80s
   Blood pressure much improved yesterday now in 130s systolic with fluid
   boluses.
   - didn't start antibiotics b/c could explain bands and shift with PE
   - chest x-ray unchanged
   - not candidate for surgery or tpa due to metastatic disease and likely
   at high risk to bleed
   - son is apparently reasonable about code status, however patient still
   wanting to be full code, will need to continue to readdress

   hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary
   artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
   - written for diet
   - lovenox when she is stable per onc (lovenox shot then 4-6 hours later
   can d/c heparin - NOT YET)
   - onc - no plans to restart chemo right now, or maybe not at all in the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. She presented with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated with a heparin drip for the PE.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 133/86 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and she is tachypneic.

The patient's physical examination reveals a tachypneic patient with crackles at the left base, and her right lung sounds are clear. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm with 2+ pedal pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 152 x 10^9/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal limits.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia, and her chest X-ray is unchanged from admission.

The patient is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, and her plan is to transition to lovenox once she is more stable medically. She is also receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for pulmonary embolism.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is currently being treated for a saddle pulmonary embolism, and there is a risk of further embolization or recurrence.
2. Right Ventricular Strain: The patient's echocardiogram shows right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, which may indicate right ventricular strain.
3. Hypoxia: The patient is tachypneic and has a low oxygen saturation, which may indicate hypoxia.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia, and her chest X-ray is unchanged from admission, which may indicate cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of a central line.
7. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of lung cancer and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of brain metastases and may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and cognitive decline.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2126-10-22**] 10:34 AM
   This morning, patient without complaints. Denies chest pain, abdominal
   pain, or difficulty breathing. Patient appears more comfortable
   breathing than yesterday morning.
   Discussion yesterday with oncology, came to conclusion that risk of PE
   untreated was higher than risk of intracranial bleed, so started on
   heparin drip
   - o2 requirements stable [**10-22**], BP 90=> 80s
   Blood pressure much improved yesterday now in 130s systolic with fluid
   boluses.
   - didn't start antibiotics b/c could explain bands and shift with PE
   - chest x-ray unchanged
   - not candidate for surgery or tpa due to metastatic disease and likely
   at high risk to bleed
   - son is apparently reasonable about code status, however patient still
   wanting to be full code, will need to continue to readdress
   - urine output currently putting out 25 cc/hr
   - echo: MPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary
   artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
   - written for diet
   - lovenox when she is stable per onc (lovenox shot then 4-6 hours later
   can d/c heparin - NOT YET)
   - onc - no plans to restart chemo right now, or maybe not at all in the
   future
   - got addition 500 cc at 9:30 pm for low urine output - JVP not
   markedly elevated, crackels at the left base

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases who presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. She was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently being treated with a heparin drip. Her blood pressure has improved with fluid boluses, and she is being monitored for oxygenation goals of >90%. The patient's oncology team has decided to discontinue chemotherapy and may not restart it in the future. The patient is being managed with IV fluids, oxygen therapy, and telemetry monitoring. She has a history of wheezing and will be started on nebulizers. The patient's son is aware of her code status, but she still wants to be full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a saddle PE, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Right Ventricular Strain: The patient's right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis may lead to cardiac failure and decreased cardiac output.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is currently 88-92%, which may lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure if not treated.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and death if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and underlying lung cancer may lead to infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and bacteremia.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 152 K/uL, which may lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac status may lead to cardiac arrest if not monitored and managed properly.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
9. Sepsis: The patient's underlying lung cancer and immunocompromised state may lead to sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
10. Kidney Injury: The patient's underlying lung cancer and chemotherapy may lead to kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease."

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2126-10-22**] 10:34 AM
   This morning, patient without complaints. Denies chest pain, abdominal
   pain, or difficulty breathing. Patient appears more comfortable
   breathing than yesterday morning.
   Discussion yesterday with oncology, came to conclusion that risk of PE
   untreated was higher than risk of intracranial bleed, so started on
   heparin drip
   - o2 requirements stable [**10-22**], BP 90=> 80s
   Blood pressure much improved yesterday now in 130s systolic with fluid
   boluses.
   - didn't start antibiotics b/c could explain bands and shift with PE
   - chest x-ray unchanged
   - not candidate for surgery or tpa due to metastatic disease and likely
   at high risk to bleed
   - son is apparently reasonable about code status, however patient still
   wanting to be full code, will need to continue to readdress
   - urine output currently putting out 25 cc/hr
   - echo: MPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
   hypokinesis with pulmonary artery hypertension probable main pulmonary
   artery thrombus c/w pulmonary embolism.
   - written for diet
   - lovenox when she is stable per onc (lovenox shot then 4-6 hours later
   can d/c heparin - NOT YET)
   - onc - no plans to restart chemo right now, or maybe not at all in the
   future
   - got addition 500 cc at 9:30 pm for low urine output - JVP not

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases, who presented to the ICU with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. She was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and was started on a heparin drip. The patient's condition has been stable, with improved blood pressure and oxygenation goals maintained. However, she has been experiencing wheezing on examination and is being treated with nebulizers. The patient's lung cancer is progressive, and oncology has no plans for further chemotherapy at this time. The patient's code status is full code, and consideration is being given to transferring her to the floor this evening or tomorrow morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a saddle PE, which is a life-threatening condition. There is a risk of further embolization, which could lead to cardiopulmonary arrest.
2. Right Ventricular Hypokinesis: The patient's right ventricular cavity is enlarged, and there is free wall hypokinesis, which could lead to further cardiac compromise.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.
4. Wheezing: The patient's wheezing could be a sign of bronchospasm or asthma, which could worsen her respiratory status.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which could lead to hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
7. Infection: The patient has a central line and is at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
8. Bleeding: The patient has a bleeding risk due to her metastatic disease and anticoagulation therapy, which could lead to hemorrhage.
9. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac disease and is at risk for cardiac arrest, which could be triggered by her PE, pulmonary hypertension, or other underlying conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo woman with a h/o HTN and NSCCA-Lung with brain/spine mets who
   presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle PE. Started
   on heparin IV and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for monitoring / management .
   1)Pulmonary Embolism: Remains hemodynamically stable although
   persistently tachycardic. Oxygenation adequate on minimal
   supplementation. Likely safe to transition to Lovenox from Heparin gtt
   given her cardiopulmonary stability over the past 48 hours.
   2) Blood pressure: She has been aggressively volume resuscitated with
   stable SBPs. HR remains elevated. Will encourage PO intake and reserve
   IVF boluses for hypotension, should it occur.
   3) Onc: No plans for further chemo at this time, per Oncology.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet, encouraged increased PO.
   5) Pulmonary: Wheezing on exam today, continue standing nebs and
   monitor serial lung exams and x-ray. Suspect moderate obstructive
   disease, although pulmonary edema (in setting of aggressive volume
   resuscitation) may be playing a role. Inhaled beta-agonists may assist
   with this.
   6) Proph: SCDs, IV heparin. PPI. Colace, senna.
   7) Code: Remains full, confirmed yesterday.
   8) Dispo: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for now, if she remains hemodynamically stable then
   consider transfer to the floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and non-small cell lung cancer with brain and spine metastases who presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). She was started on heparin IV and admitted to the ICU for monitoring and management. The patient remains hemodynamically stable, but persistently tachycardic. Oxygenation is adequate on minimal supplementation. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but her heart rate remains elevated. She has been aggressively volume-resuscitated and is encouraged to increase oral intake and reserve IV fluids for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient remains at risk for further pulmonary embolism due to her underlying condition and the presence of a saddle PE.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent tachycardia and hypotension may indicate a risk of further hypotension, which could exacerbate her condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's wheezing on exam and moderate obstructive disease may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if her oxygenation is not adequately managed.
4. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count and elevated lactate levels may indicate a risk of sepsis, particularly if her underlying condition is not well-controlled.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate a risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
6. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly if her platelet count is low.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and catheters may increase her risk of infection, particularly if her wound care and infection control measures are not adequate.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, and cardiac function to prevent or manage these potential complications. Additionally, the patient's underlying condition and treatment plan should be carefully managed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). Over the past 24 hours, the patient received approximately 2.5L of IV fluids, with stable oxygenation and blood pressure, but persistently tachycardic. The patient is on a diet, but PO intake remains low. The patient remains full code.

Recent lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 152 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.09 ng/mL
* Glucose: 141 mg/dL

Recent imaging shows a clear chest x-ray with a lingular infiltrate consistent with a known mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachycardia and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated PASP and free wall hypokinesis may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's low PO intake and recent antibiotics may increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's low PO intake and recent use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. DVT/PE progression: The patient's existing saddle PE may worsen, leading to further complications.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may increase the risk of infection, particularly respiratory or urinary tract infections.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated PASP and free wall hypokinesis may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
8. Renal failure: The patient's recent use of anticoagulants and potential bleeding may increase the risk of renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   68yo woman with a h/o HTN and NSCCA-Lung with brain/spine mets who
   presented with palpitations and was found to have a saddle PE. Started
   on heparin IV and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for monitoring / management .
   1)Pulmonary Embolism: Remains hemodynamically stable although
   persistently tachycardic. Oxygenation adequate on minimal
   supplementation. Likely safe to transition to Lovenox from Heparin gtt
   given her cardiopulmonary stability over the past 48 hours.
   2) Blood pressure: She has been aggressively volume resuscitated with
   stable SBPs. HR remains elevated. Will encourage PO intake and reserve
   IVF boluses for hypotension, should it occur.
   3) Onc: No plans for further chemo at this time, per Oncology.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet, encouraged increased PO.
   5) Pulmonary: Wheezing on exam today, continue standing nebs and
   monitor serial lung exams and x-ray. Suspect moderate obstructive
   disease, although pulmonary edema (in setting of aggressive volume
   resuscitation) may be playing a role. Inhaled beta-agonists may assist
   with this.
   6) Proph: SCDs, IV heparin. PPI. Colace, senna.
   7) Code: Remains full, confirmed yesterday.
   8) Dispo: [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for now, if she remains hemodynamically stable then
   consider transfer to the floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, NSCCA-Lung, and brain/spine metastases who presented with palpitations and was diagnosed with a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and management. The patient has been receiving heparin IV and has been hemodynamically stable, although persistently tachycardic. She has been aggressively volume resuscitated with stable blood pressures, but her heart rate remains elevated.

The patient's laboratory results show a slight decrease in hemoglobin and platelet count, but her other lab values are within normal limits. Her chest x-ray shows a lingular infiltrate consistent with her known mass, with no change from yesterday.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient remains hemodynamically stable, and it is likely safe to transition to Lovenox from heparin gtt given her cardiopulmonary stability over the past 48 hours.
2. Blood Pressure: The patient has been aggressively volume resuscitated with stable SBPs, and her HR remains elevated. PO intake is encouraged, and IVF boluses will be reserved for hypotension.
3. Oncology: No plans for further chemotherapy at this time, per oncology.
4. Fluid and Electrolyte: Regular diet is encouraged, and the patient will be monitored for fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Pulmonary: Wheezing is present on examination, and inhaled beta-agonists may assist with this. The patient will be monitored for serial lung exams and x-rays.
6. Prophylaxis: SCDs, IV heparin, PPI, Colace, and senna are being used as prophylaxis.
7. Code: The patient remains full code, confirmed yesterday.
8. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU for now, and if she remains hemodynamically stable, she may be considered for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's saddle PE may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and elevated blood pressure may lead to cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's wheezing and lung infiltrate may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or respiratory failure.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization may lead to infectious complications, such as sepsis, urinary tract infections, or pneumonia.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's heparin therapy may lead to bleeding complications, such as hemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hematuria.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decline, leading to bleeding complications or platelet transfusions.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalances may lead to complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures."

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases, who presents with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. She was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and was treated with lovenox, supplemental oxygen, and nebulizers. Her current condition is stable, with improved oxygen saturation and respiratory function compared to admission. She is fluid-positive, but her blood pressure is unremarkable, and her chest X-ray (CXR) shows no increased edema or cephalization.

The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications, including Keppra, Dilantin, Lamictal, and Toprol XL. She has received antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, and has been treated with pantoprazole and enoxaparin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is improving, but she still has diffuse wheezing in her upper and mid-lung fields. She may require further treatment to improve her lung function.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and it is likely that her condition will continue to improve with treatment.
3. Heart failure: The patient's heart rhythm is normal, but her blood pressure is slightly elevated. She may be at risk for heart failure, especially if her fluid status is not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of antibiotic use, and her white blood cell count is slightly elevated. She may be at risk for infection, especially if her immune system is compromised.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving IV fluids and may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies if she is not receiving adequate nutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue lovenox and supplemental oxygen to manage the patient's PE.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust her treatment as needed to improve her lung function.
3. Manage the patient's fluid status carefully to prevent heart failure.
4. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust her antibiotic treatment as needed to prevent infection.
5. Provide the patient with adequate nutrition and consider using a feeding tube if she is not able to tolerate oral nutrition."

Summary:

The patient is a 70 kg male who has been in the ICU for an unknown duration. They have a history of allergies to Keppra, Dilantin, Lamictal, and Toprol XL, and have received antibiotics, including Ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/70 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 92%. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total input of 2,188 mL and a total output of 655 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, and a decreased hematocrit of 27.1%. Their platelet count is 121 K/uL, and their creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.09 ng/mL, and their glucose level is 141 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their inability to assess certain areas, including their peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory systems. The patient's movements and tone are also not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased hematocrit may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase their risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's decreased creatinine level and elevated troponin-T level may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose level may indicate hyperglycemia, which could lead to hypoglycemia if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's limited lung function and need for oxygen therapy may increase their risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level may indicate cardiac injury, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Neurologic complications: The patient's inability to assess certain areas of their physical examination, including their neurologic system, may indicate the presence of neurologic complications.
8. DVT or PE: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase their risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and potential underlying infection may increase their risk of developing a stress ulcer.
10. VAP: The patient's need for oxygen therapy and potential underlying infection may increase their risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases who presented to the ICU with palpitations and feeling unwell for two days. She was found to have a saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient is currently receiving lovenox, supplemental oxygen, and telemetry monitoring. She is also receiving IV fluids as needed with caution to avoid fluid overload.

The patient has a history of rash with multiple medications, including Keppra, Dilantin, Lamictal, and Toprol XL. She has also received antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, and has had IV infusions of pantoprazole and enoxaparin.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 123 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 92%
* Heart rhythm: sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.0-9.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 29.8-30.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 152-121 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.09-0.07 ng/mL
* Glucose: 141-148 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to the saddle PE and potential pulmonary hypertension
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to the PE and potential right ventricular cavity hypokinesis
* Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's prolonged ICU stay and respiratory support
* Fluid overload due to the patient's IV fluids and potential cardiac dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, due to the patient's medications and potential cardiac dysfunction
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or diarrhea, due to the patient's medications and potential cardiac dysfunction"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 68-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and a history of lung cancer. She has been experiencing increased wheezing and tachypnea overnight, with a persistent tachycardia of 125 beats per minute. Her blood pressure has stabilized, but she still requires oxygen therapy. She has a history of allergies to certain medications, including Keppra, Dilantin, Lamictal, and Toprol XL. She has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.

Assessment:

The patient's respiratory status has improved with nebulizer treatment, but she still requires oxygen therapy. Her tachycardia is persistent, and her blood pressure has stabilized. She has a history of lung cancer, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress. She is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism due to her history of lung cancer and prolonged immobility.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent tachypnea and wheezing may indicate the development of pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for oxygen therapy and her tachypnea may indicate the development of respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and history of lung cancer may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of lung cancer and prolonged immobility make her at risk for developing DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged immobility and respiratory distress make her at risk for developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.

Plan:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
2. Continue IV fluids and anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.
3. Monitor the patient's tachycardia and blood pressure, and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen if pneumonia is suspected.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent malnutrition.
6. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI.
7. Consider transferring the patient to the floor with continued stability in regards to hemodynamics and oxygenation."
