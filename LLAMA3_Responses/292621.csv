   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on esmolol drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of reintubation/extubation
   and ERCP, now found to have collapsed lung, all of  which may have been
   stressors.  With development of fever overnight, there may also be an
   infectious component.  [**Month (only) 8**] also consider volume depletion given recent
   hx of poor PO intake.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  No
   underlying pulmonary disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - pt refused PO meds o/n, therefore started on dilt gtt, changed to
   esmolol gtt with improved rate control and conversion to sinus rhythm
   - episode of hypotension overnight (SBP in the high 70s), esmolol
   d/c
   - consider echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue tachycardia with IVF, pain control, treatment for possible
   infection
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - will continue maintenance fluids 125 cc D51/2NS.
   - urine output has remained >30 cc/h
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR this AM (unable to obtain last night due to agitation)
   showed collapsed lung/atelectasis, likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, possible aspiration pneumonia
   vs. pneumonitis given recent fever but not evident on CXR.
   - initially had increased O2 requirement, but now satting high 90s on
   NRB.  Frequently takes off mask voluntarily.
   - chest PT, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - positive pressure noninvasive mask
   - talk to mother today, consider bronch should conservative management
   fail
   - follow CXR tomorrow AM
   - abg unable to obtain due to inability to hold still
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: spike to 101.1 overnight.  Pending CBC for this
   AM.  Source of infection unclear, but possibilities include post-op
   atelectasis/collapse, post-ERCP seeding, aspiration pneumonia.
   Initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis, but spiked
   to 101.1 overnight.  Currently afebrile with pending CBC.  Concern for
   post-ERCP seeding, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis given
   intubation/extubation.
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM
   (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - development of hypotension possible secondary to esmolol gtt, but
   concern for development of sepsis
   - IV access is failing, currently with one fickle IV; talk to mother
   regarding PICC line vs. CVL
   - pending blood cx from [**8-29**]; urine cx pending
   - no diarrhea
   - likely will need peripheral IV change
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   - IVF as above
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology following; post ERCP recommend NPO overnight with IVF.
   [**Month (only) 8**] advance diet in the AM.  Consider cholecystectomy in the future.
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazeoan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.
   - ammonia levels on [**8-24**]: 84 (elevated).  Continue to monitor.
   - aspiration precautions
   .
   #. FEN: dysphagia diet (taking great POs), monitor lytes, IVF to
   maintain SBP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

**Clinical Summary:**

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, recurrent prostatitis, cerebral palsy, cardiomyopathy, and aspiration pneumonia in the past. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after ERCP for gallstones. Overnight, he developed a fever (101.1°F) and hypotension (SBP 70s). He was started on esmolol drip, which controlled his heart rate and converted his atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.

**Current Status:**

* Vital signs: T 101.1°F, HR 101 bpm, BP 89/46 mmHg, RR 30 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%
* Respiratory support: nasal cannula with 100% O2
* Neurological status: awake, alert, and able to move all extremities, but does not speak and does not track gaze
* Skin: jaundiced
* Labs: WBC 64 mg/dL, ALT 85, AST 97, LDH 178, AP 589, amylase 40, lipase 63, total bilirubin 10.4
* Urine output: >30 cc/h
* Fluid balance: 753 mL positive balance

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infection, which could be related to post-op atelectasis/collapse, post-ERCP seeding, aspiration pneumonia, or pneumonitis.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. **Cardiac complications:** The patient's atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. **Respiratory complications:** The patient's collapsed lung and atelectasis may lead to respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
5. **Gastrointestinal complications:** The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and gastroparesis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
6. **Neurological complications:** The patient's history of seizure disorder and encephalopathy may lead to neurological complications, such as seizure activity or altered mental status.
7. **Hepatic complications:** The patient's cholestasis and transaminitis may lead to hepatic complications, such as liver failure or cirrhosis.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance.
* Start antibiotics for possible infection and sepsis.
* Continue esmolol drip to control heart rate and rhythm.
* Consider echo in the morning to assess cardiac function.
* Continue IVF and pain control as needed.
* Monitor for signs of cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and hepatic complications.
* Consider bronchoscopy or CT scan to evaluate for possible infection or pneumonitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of reintubation/extubation
   and ERCP, now found to have collapsed lung, all of  which may have been
   stressors.  With development of fever overnight, there may also be an
   infectious component.  [**Month (only) 8**] also consider volume depletion given recent
   hx of poor PO intake.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  No
   underlying pulmonary disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - pt refused PO meds o/n, therefore started on dilt gtt, changed to
   esmolol gtt with improved rate control and conversion to sinus rhythm
   - episode of hypotension overnight (SBP in the high 70s), esmolol
   d/c
   - consider echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - will continue maintenance fluids 125 cc D51/2NS.
   - urine output has remained >30 cc/h
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR this AM (unable to obtain last night due to agitation)
   showed collapsed lung/atelectasis, likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, possible aspiration pneumonia
   vs. pneumonitis given recent fever but not evident on CXR.
   - initially had increased O2 requirement, but now satting high 90s on
   5L NC
   - chest PT
   - patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - talk to mother today, consider bronch should conservative management
   fail
   - follow CXR tomorrow AM
   - abg unable to obtain due to inability to hold still
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: spike to 101.1 overnight.  Pending CBC for this
   AM.  Source of infection unclear, but possibilities include post-op
   atelectasis/collapse, post-ERCP seeding, aspiration pneumonia.
   Initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis, but spiked
   to 101.1 overnight.  Currently afebrile.  Concern for post-ERCP
   seeding, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis given
   intubation/extubation.
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM
   (day 1: [**8-29**]).  Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - pending blood cx from [**8-29**]; urine cx pending
   - no diarrhea
   - likely will need peripheral IV change, but per IV team, no other
   veins to access.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology following; post ERCP recommend NPO overnight with IVF.
   [**Month (only) 8**] advance diet in the AM.  Consider cholecystectomy in the future.
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazeoan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of reintubation/extubation
   and ERCP, now found to have collapsed lung, all of  which may have been
   stressors.  With development of fever overnight, there may also be an
   infectious component.  [**Month (only) 8**] also consider volume depletion given recent
   hx of poor PO intake.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  No
   underlying pulmonary disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - pt refused PO meds o/n, therefore started on dilt gtt, changed to
   esmolol gtt with improved rate control and conversion to sinus rhythm
   - episode of hypotension overnight (SBP in the high 70s), esmolol
   d/c
   - consider echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - will continue maintenance fluids 125 cc D51/2NS.
   - urine output has remained >30 cc/h
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR this AM (unable to obtain last night due to agitation)
   showed collapsed lung/atelectasis, likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, possible aspiration pneumonia
   vs. pneumonitis given recent fever but not evident on CXR.
   - initially had increased O2 requirement, but now satting high 90s on
   5L NC
   - chest PT
   - patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - talk to mother today, consider bronch should conservative management
   fail
   - follow CXR tomorrow AM
   - abg unable to obtain due to inability to hold still
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: spike to 101.1 overnight.  Pending CBC for this
   AM.  Source of infection unclear, but possibilities include post-op
   atelectasis/collapse, post-ERCP seeding, aspiration pneumonia.
   Initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis, but spiked
   to 101.1 overnight.  Currently afebrile.  Concern for post-ERCP
   seeding, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis given
   intubation/extubation.
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM
   (day 1: [**8-29**]).  Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - pending blood cx from [**8-29**]; urine cx pending
   - no diarrhea
   - likely will need peripheral IV change, but per IV team, no other
   veins to access.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology following; post ERCP recommend NPO overnight with IVF.
   [**Month (only) 8**] advance diet in the AM.  Consider cholecystectomy in the future.
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazeoan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.
   - ammonia levels on [**8-24**]: 84 (elevated).  Continue to monitor.
   - aspiration precautions

   Disposition: ICU today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a complex medical history, including Gastaut Syndrome, recurrent prostatitis, cerebral palsy, cardiomyopathy, and aspiration pneumonia in the past. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was found to have a collapsed lung on chest X-ray.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.1°F (38.4°C) with a spike overnight
* Tachycardia: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Hypotension: blood pressure (BP) in the high 70s
* Respiratory support: nasal cannula oxygen at 6 liters per minute (L/min) with an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%
* Neurological status: awake, alert, and able to move all extremities, but unable to speak or track gaze
* Skin: jaundiced
* Laboratory results: elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH), elevated bilirubin, and decreased calcium levels

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: may be related to stress, intubation, or ERCP
2. Collapsed lung: likely secondary to trauma during intubation, barotrauma, pain, or aspiration pneumonia
3. Fever and leukocytosis: may be related to post-op atelectasis, post-ERCP seeding, aspiration pneumonia, or sepsis
4. Transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase: likely secondary to ERCP with sphincterotomy
5. Encephalopathy: may be related to toxic or metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis
6. Questionable cardiomyopathy: may be related to underlying heart disease or medication
7. Aspiration pneumonia: may be related to previous episodes of aspiration

The patient's medications include:

* Diltiazem drip
* Esmolol drip
* Ciprofloxacin IV
* Metronidazole IV
* Keppra IV
* Diazepam IM
* Fexofenadine (stopped due to potential hepatotoxicity)
* Depakote (stopped due to potential hepatotoxicity)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue IV fluids to maintain SBP > 90 mmHg
* Monitor for signs of sepsis or infection
* Repeat chest X-ray tomorrow morning
* Continue antibiotics for potential infection
* Consider bronchoscopy if conservative management fails
* Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin levels
* Continue to monitor neurological status and consider EEG or ammonia levels if necessary

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is ICU until his condition is stabilized."

     * Many round stones ranging in size from 4mm to 5mm were seen in the
       biliary tree, in the common bile duct, the cystic duct and the
       gallbladder.
     * One stone was seen at the origin of the left intrahepatic duct.
     * A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
       sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
     * The impacted stone was released following sphincterotomy
     * Multiple (>10) stones were successfully extracted using a 11.5 mm
       RX balloon, requiring multiple balloon sweeps for clearance
     * The stone in the left intrahepatic duct was extracted successfully
       using a 4mm Hurricane balloon.
     * The intrahepatic duct and common bile duct were clear at the end of
       the procedure
     * Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
   - CXR: [**8-24**]: cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable and
   unchanged from previous study.  The hila appeared normal bilaterally.
   Lung fields are clear.  No evidence of pleural effusion or PTX.
   -EEG: [**8-27**]:
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no
   clinical evident seizures. There was a lot of interictal activity both
   in a generalized and multifocal distribution. The background activity
   was slow suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy. In addition, there
   were periods of more rhythmic activity mostly bifrontal in distribution
   which may represent subclinical seizures
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of extubation and ERCP,
   which may have been stressors.  No underlying cardiac or pulmonary
   disease.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  Unlikely infectious
   etiology, given lack of leukocytosis, fever, and clear CXR.  Appears
   dry, may be volume depleted.
   - Has received diltiazem IV push with mild efficacy.
   - Due to question of ability to take PO meds, begun on diltiazem gtt
   with mild decrease in HR.  Will need to add PO dilt, but question of
   adequate PO intake.
   - added esmolol gtt with conversion to sinus rhythm.  Unfortunately,
   due to transient hypotension with BP in 70s, was held.  Has remained in
   sinus rhythm with rate in the low 100s.
   - echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis,
   but there was low threshold to start abx with concern for post-ERCP
   seeding, sepsis.  Also concern for possible aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis given intubation/extubation X 2.  Consider aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to intubation X 2.
   - initially had increased O2 requirement, but now satting high 90s on
   5L NC
   - attempt to obtain CXR this AM
   - abg unable to obtain due to inability to hold still
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: spike to 101.1 overnight.  Pending CBC for this
   AM.  Source of infection unclear, but possibiltiies include post-ERCP
   seeding, aspiration pneumonia.  Has already completed 13 day course of
   unasyn for prostatitis ([**8-22**]).
   - urine cx negative on [**8-23**]
   - pending blood cx from [**8-29**]; urine cx pending
   - no diarrhea
   - repeat CXR
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM.
   Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - likely will need peripheral IV change, but per IV team, no other
   veins to access.
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology following; post ERCP recommend NPO overnight with IVF.
   [**Month (only) 8**] advance diet in the AM.  Consider cholecystectomy in the future.
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazeoan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of extubation and ERCP,
   which may have been stressors.  No underlying cardiac or pulmonary
   disease.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  Unlikely infectious
   etiology, given lack of leukocytosis, fever, and clear CXR.  Appears
   dry, may be volume depleted.
   - Has received diltiazem IV push with mild efficacy.
   - Due to question of ability to take PO meds, begun on diltiazem gtt
   with mild decrease in HR.  Will need to add PO dilt, but question of
   adequate PO intake.
   - added esmolol gtt with conversion to sinus rhythm.  Unfortunately,
   due to transient hypotension with BP in 70s, was held.  Has remained in
   sinus rhythm with rate in the low 100s.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) following an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree. He was previously intubated and extubated, and then re-intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient has a fever of 101.1°F, and has been diagnosed with cholelithiasis with no signs of cholecystitis. He has also been experiencing hypoxia, which has been treated with oxygen therapy. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, which may be related to the ERCP procedure. He is also experiencing transaminitis, which may be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of intubation and extubation, combined with his current respiratory distress, may increase his risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Cholestatic hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels may indicate the presence of cholestatic hepatitis, which could lead to liver failure.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's EEG results suggest the presence of encephalopathy, which could be related to his seizure activity or toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be related to his respiratory distress or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels may indicate the presence of liver failure, which could lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of ERCP procedure may increase his risk of developing pancreatitis.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gallstones and ERCP procedure may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics to treat any potential infections.
3. Continue to provide oxygen therapy to treat the patient's hypoxia.
4. Consider performing a liver biopsy to determine the cause of the patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
5. Consider referring the patient to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or a neurologist, to further evaluate and treat his underlying medical conditions.
6. Consider performing a stress test to evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
7. Consider referring the patient to a nutritionist to develop a diet plan that meets his nutritional needs.
8. Consider referring the patient to a psychologist to evaluate his mental status and develop a plan to manage his anxiety and stress."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    - ERCP [**8-28**]: Impacted stone in the major papilla.
     * Many round stones ranging in size from 4mm to 5mm were seen in the
       biliary tree, in the common bile duct, the cystic duct and the
       gallbladder.
     * One stone was seen at the origin of the left intrahepatic duct.
     * A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
       sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
     * The impacted stone was released following sphincterotomy
     * Multiple (>10) stones were successfully extracted using a 11.5 mm
       RX balloon, requiring multiple balloon sweeps for clearance
     * The stone in the left intrahepatic duct was extracted successfully
       using a 4mm Hurricane balloon.
     * The intrahepatic duct and common bile duct were clear at the end of
       the procedure
     * Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
   - CXR: [**8-24**]: cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable and
   unchanged from previous study.  The hila appeared normal bilaterally.
   Lung fields are clear.  No evidence of pleural effusion or PTX.
   -EEG: [**8-27**]:
   This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no
   clinical evident seizures. There was a lot of interictal activity both
   in a generalized and multifocal distribution. The background activity
   was slow suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy. In addition, there
   were periods of more rhythmic activity mostly bifrontal in distribution
   which may represent subclinical seizures
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.  Now on diltiazem drip and hemodynamically stable.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of extubation and ERCP,
   which may have been stressors.  No underlying cardiac or pulmonary
   disease.  No known history of a. fib in the past.  Unlikely infectious
   etiology, given lack of leukocytosis, fever, and clear CXR.  Appears
   dry, may be volume depleted.
   - Has received diltiazem IV push with mild efficacy.
   - Due to question of ability to take PO meds, begun on diltiazem gtt
   with mild decrease in HR.  Will need to add PO dilt, but question of
   adequate PO intake.
   - added esmolol gtt with conversion to sinus rhythm.  Unfortunately,
   due to transient hypotension with BP in 70s, was held.  Has remained in
   sinus rhythm with rate in the low 100s.
   - echo in the AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - Place on telemetry
   .
   # hypoxia: initially on presentation was afebrile with no leukocytosis,
   but there was low threshold to start abx with concern for post-ERCP
   seeding, sepsis.  Also concern for possible aspiration pneumonia vs.
   pneumonitis given intubation/extubation X 2.  Consider aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to intubation X 2.
   - initially had increased O2 requirement, but now satting high 90s on
   5L NC
   - attempt to obtain CXR this AM
   - abg unable to obtain due to inability to hold still
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis: spike to 101.1 overnight.  Pending CBC for this
   AM.  Source of infection unclear, but possibiltiies include post-ERCP
   seeding, aspiration pneumonia.  Has already completed 13 day course of
   unasyn for prostatitis ([**8-22**]).
   - urine cx negative on [**8-23**]
   - pending blood cx from [**8-29**]; urine cx pending
   - no diarrhea
   - repeat CXR
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM.
   Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - likely will need peripheral IV change, but per IV team, no other
   veins to access.
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - continue trending LFTs, bilirubin, alk phos.  Monitor for improvement
   in markers s/p ERCP.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology following; post ERCP recommend NPO overnight with IVF.
   [**Month (only) 8**] advance diet in the AM.  Consider cholecystectomy in the future.
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazeoan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.
   - ammonia levels on [**8-24**]: 84 (elevated).  Continue to monitor.
   - aspiration precautions
   .
   #. FEN: dysphagia diet (taking great POs), monitor lytes, IVF to

	+ Hypoxia (initially required increased O2, now satting high 90s on 6L NC)
	+ Transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin (s/p ERCP)
	+ Questionable encephalopathy (EEG suggested encephalopathy, but neurology suggests unlikely related to seizure activity)
	+ Potential for aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis (due to intubation/extubation x 2)
* Plan:
	+ Continue Cipro and Flagyl antibiotics
	+ Monitor for improvement in markers s/p ERCP
	+ Trend LFTs, bilirubin, and alk phos
	+ Consider cholecystectomy in the future
	+ Continue Keppra and Duazeoan medications as needed
	+ Monitor for seizures and potential for aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis
	+ Continue aspiration precautions
	+ DNR/DNI code status
	+ ICU care until rate controlled

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to undiagnosed infection
* Aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis
* Cholestatic hepatitis or liver failure
* Encephalopathy or seizures
* Hypotension or shock due to fluid depletion or medication side effects
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Hepatic failure or liver failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo male with [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut syndrome (baseline--non-verbal,
   persistent seizures) with initial admission with prostatitis who now
   had cholelithiasis driving cholecystitis and following ERCP with
   substantial stone removal had re-intubation with ventilatory failure
   complicated by evolution of Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular
   response.  His course overnight was complicated by hyptension, fever
   and hypoxia but with conversion to sinus rhythm.
   1)Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia-Initial failure was likely related to
   medication effects but now has substantial post operative
   atelectasis
this may be related to fever in addition to the hypoxia.
   -Intermittent positive pressure ventilation
   -Incentive spirometry may be difficult for patient
   -Will consider bronchoscopy if patient unable to clear
   -Chest PT and intermittent positive pressure ventilation today.
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-Patient with evolution of this seen in acute
   setting with re-intubation.
   -Will maintain adequate volume
   -Will continue with PRN rate control only as he remains in sinus rhythm
   at this time
   -Will need longer term follow up of ECHO and TSH to complete evaluation
   -Tylenol for fever

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut syndrome, initially admitted for prostatitis, who developed cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, and subsequently underwent ERCP with stone removal. He was reintubated due to ventilatory failure, complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Overnight, the patient experienced hypertension, fever, and hypoxia, but converted to sinus rhythm.

Current Status:

* Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia: The patient has post-operative atelectasis, which may be related to fever and hypoxia. He requires intermittent positive pressure ventilation, incentive spirometry, and possible bronchoscopy if unable to clear secretions.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has evolved atrial fibrillation in the acute setting with re-intubation. He requires adequate volume maintenance, PRN rate control, and longer-term follow-up with ECHO and TSH.
* Cholelithiasis with Cholecystitis: The patient has cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, which will be managed with antibiotics (Cipro and Flagyl) and enzyme monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia: The patient's post-operative atelectasis may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and hypoxia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Cholelithiasis with Cholecystitis: The patient's cholelithiasis and cholecystitis may lead to complications, such as pancreatitis, sepsis, or abscess formation.
4. Fever: The patient's fever may persist or worsen, leading to complications, such as sepsis, organ dysfunction, or death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction, sepsis, or death.
6. Seizure: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen, leading to further seizures, status epilepticus, or other neurological complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control and longer-term follow-up.
3. Monitor the patient's cholelithiasis and cholecystitis with enzyme monitoring and imaging studies.
4. Treat the patient's fever aggressively, and monitor for signs of sepsis.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and volume status closely, and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Monitor the patient's seizure disorder, and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR.
   .
   # hypoxia: continued to have oxygen sats in the mid to high 90s.  CXR
   yesterday showed left sided pleural effusion and lower lobe and lingula
   collapse.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding intubation/extubation,
   barotrauma, pain.
   - satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off mask
   voluntarily.
   - continue chest PT, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive
   spirometry
   - try  intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   - consider bronch should conservative management fail
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # fever/leukocytosis/hypotension: gram positive cocci in clusters found
   growing in his blood.  Spike to 101.2 overnight in conjunction with
   rising WBC.  Source of infection unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] evidence of skin
   breakdown.  Concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis, post-ERCP seeding, introduction through the skin given
   difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - grew gram positive cocci in clusters in his blood
   - follow urine and blood cultures for speciation
   - started on vancomycin 1g q12 hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Was started on Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg IV q8h this AM
   (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - unable to place PICC line.  Has 2 peripheral IVs.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   - IVF boluses
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of reintubation/extubation
   and ERCP, now found to have partial lung collapse and gram positive
   cocci in clusters growing in his blood, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - continues to be in sinus, rate in the low 100s
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal > 90
   - consider echo this  AM, but unsure if patient will tolerate
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs; duct has been
   cleared so should start to fall, if continues to rise, will discuss
   about possible stent insertion but this discussion is premature at this
   point.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) following an ERCP procedure for gallstones. He developed fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, with gram-positive cocci in clusters growing in his blood cultures. He was started on vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin, and his blood cultures are pending speciation. He also has a history of prostatitis, post-ERCP seeding, and skin breakdown, which may be contributing to his infection.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a left-sided pleural effusion and lower lobe and lingula collapse, which may be secondary to trauma from intubation/extubation, barotrauma, or pain. He is on oxygen therapy and has frequent episodes of desaturation. He is also at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a sinus tachycardia rate in the low 100s. He has a history of questionable cardiomyopathy, but no underlying pulmonary disease.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin. He has a history of ERCP with sphincterotomy and removal of over 10 gallstones, which may be contributing to his liver dysfunction. Hepatotoxic medications, such as Depakote, Zonegran, and Fexofenadine, have been discontinued.

The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 32 to 28, which is consistent with anemia of chronic disease. He has low ferritin and elevated TIBC, which suggests anemia of chronic disease.

The patient's neurological status is stable, with no changes in seizure activity. He is on Keppra and Duazeoan for seizure control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension are indicative of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised respiratory status and risk of aspiration pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
4. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal LFTs and history of ERCP with sphincterotomy may lead to liver failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's drop in hematocrit and history of anemia of chronic disease may lead to anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
6. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizure activity and neurological instability may lead to further seizure activity, which can be life-threatening.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient's history of skin breakdown and poor wound care may lead to further skin breakdown and infection.
8. Urinary tract infection: The patient's history of prostatitis and post-ERCP seeding may lead to urinary tract infection.
9. Vascular complications: The patient's history of ERCP with sphincterotomy and removal of over 10 gallstones may lead to vascular complications, such as embolism or thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a past medical history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) following an ERCP procedure for gallstones in the biliary tree.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.2°F (38.4°C) with a spike overnight
* Hypotension: treated with IV boluses with a goal of >90 mmHg
* Tachycardia: in the low 100s, treated with IV fluids and pain control
* Respiratory support: high-flow nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 96%
* Neurological status: awake, alert, and able to move all extremities, but unable to speak or track gaze
* Abdominal examination: soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present
* Skin examination: jaundiced
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 8.9 K/uL
	+ Hct: 28.1%
	+ Platelet count: 212 K/uL
	+ Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
	+ Glucose: 62-132 mg/dL
	+ Liver function tests: transaminitis, increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin
	+ Blood culture: grew gram-positive cocci in clusters

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: given the patient's fever, tachycardia, and positive blood culture
* Post-ERCP seeding: a possible source of infection
* Aspiration pneumonia: due to intubation and extubation
* Pneumonitis: given the patient's history of ERCP and intubation
* Volume depletion: due to poor oral intake and recent history of hypotension
* Hepatic cholestasis: secondary to ERCP and potential medication toxicity
* Anemia: normocytic with a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28
* Encephalopathy: suggested to be due to toxic or metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis
* Seizure activity: given the patient's history of Gastaut Syndrome and ongoing anticonvulsant therapy

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole
* IV fluids: maintenance fluids and boluses as needed
* Respiratory support: high-flow nasal cannula
* Pain control: IV fluids and medications as needed
* Seizure prophylaxis: Keppra and Duazepam
* Hepatic cholestasis management: monitoring of liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase
* Anemia management: monitoring of hematocrit and transfusion as needed
* Encephalopathy management: aspiration precautions and monitoring of neurological status

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU care until his condition is stabilized."

   MRSA ([**8-29**]): Positive
   CXR: ([**8-29**]) :
   The lower half of the left hemithorax is uniformly opacified, and there
   is a
   sharp cutoff to the lumen of the left main bronchus at the level of the
   upper
   lobe origin. Some of the opacification is due to left pleural effusion
   and
   some, given the absence of rightward mediastinal shift, is due to lower
   lobe
   and lingular collapse. Right lung is clear. Cardiac size cannot be
   assessed.
   Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5888**] at the time of
   dictation.
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Spike to 101.2 overnight in
   conjunction with rising WBC.  Source of infection likely biliary source
   s/p ERCP, but concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis, introduction through the skin given difficulty with Ivs,
   aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine and blood cultures for speciation
   - continue on day 2 of vancomycin 1g q12 hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 2 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - will obtain echo today
   - unable to place PICC line.  Has 2 peripheral IVs.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow AM
   - IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - robust urine output
   .
   # hypoxia: continued to have oxygen sats in the mid to high 90s.  CXR
   yesterday showed left sided pleural effusion and lower lobe and lingula
   atelectasis.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain.
   - satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off mask
   voluntarily.
   - continue chest PT to mobilize secretions, patient will unlikely
   cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - continue with antibiotics
   - trial with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   unsuccessful
   - consider bronch should conservative management fail
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - continues to be in sinus, rate in the low 100s
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal SBP >
   90
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward with the exeption of t bili.  Remains
   jaundiced.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs; duct has been
   cleared so should start to fall, if continues to rise, will discuss
   about possible stent insertion but this discussion is premature at this
   point.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28.  Normocytic.

   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and atelectasis following an ERCP procedure. The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a gram-positive MRSA bacteremia, which is likely related to the biliary source, but there is also concern for urinary and VRE sources.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has continued to experience hypoxia, with oxygen saturation in the mid-to-high 90s, likely secondary to trauma from intubation/extubation, barotrauma, and pain.
3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely related to acute disease, including reintubation/extubation, ERCP, and MRSA bacteremia.
4. Transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin: The patient has developed transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin levels, likely related to the ERCP procedure and possible hepatic cholestasis.
5. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which is likely related to chronic disease.
6. Questionable encephalopathy: The patient has been reported to be at baseline mental status, but EEG suggested encephalopathy, which is unlikely related to seizure activity and may be due to toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.
7. FEN (Feeding): The patient is still NPO, and his electrolytes are being monitored, with maintenance fluids continued.

The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and Cipro, and has had an unsuccessful attempt at placing a PICC line. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the source of the infection is still unknown.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics
* Monitoring urine and blood cultures for speciation
* Obtaining an echo today
* Repeating CXR tomorrow AM
* IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
* Robust urine output
* Continuing chest PT to mobilize secretions
* Trial with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
* Considering bronchoscopy if conservative management fails
* Unable to diurese pleural fluid due to hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of intractable seizures, gallstones, and complications from ERCP, including atrial fibrillation and atelectasis. The patient's current condition includes:

* Cholecystitis
* Sepsis
* Atelectasis
* Atrial fibrillation
* Fever (101.2°F)
* Hypertension (controlled with IVF bolus)
* Positive blood cultures with GPC and Vanco started
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Collapse and effusion on CXR
* Altered mental status
* Tenuous respiratory status

The patient is receiving antibiotics for likely biliary source, and the plan is to continue monitoring culture results. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further sepsis progression, potentially leading to organ failure
* Respiratory failure exacerbation, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmia worsening, potentially leading to cardiac arrest
* Neurological deterioration, potentially resulting in seizures or altered mental status
* Infection spread to other organs, potentially leading to multi-organ failure
* Development of acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Worsening of hypertension, potentially leading to end-organ damage

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies to adjust treatment accordingly and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR and atelectasis. He underwent ERCP for gallstones in the biliary tree and was found to have a MRSA bacteremia. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole, and is currently receiving IVF boluses to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/62 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 27 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96% on a high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.9 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 28.1%
* Platelet count: 212 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 62 mg/dL
* Lactic dehydrogenase: 133 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* A chest X-ray showing left-sided lung collapse
* An echocardiogram showing hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and normal diastolic function
* A transesophageal echocardiogram showing no evidence of endocarditis or abscess

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis: Gram-positive MRSA bacteremia
* Hypoxia: Atelectasis/collapse of the left lung
* Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes, possibly related to ERCP or medication
* Anemia: Normocytic anemia, possibly related to chronic disease
* Encephalopathy: Questionable toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic hepatitis
* Aspiration risk: Due to intubation and extubation

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia
* Monitoring liver enzymes and bilirubin levels
* Managing hypoxia with oxygen therapy and bronchoscopy
* Transfusing blood products as needed
* Managing anemia with iron supplements and blood transfusions
* Managing encephalopathy with anticonvulsants and supportive care
* Providing nutritional support with advance diet if tolerated
* Monitoring for signs of aspiration and taking precautions to prevent it

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is to remain in the ICU until his heart rate is controlled."

   regurgitation seen.
   - CXR: ([**8-31**]): my read: worsening left sided lung collapse
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Temperature did not spike as high
   overnight, currently afebrile, with downtrending WBC.  Source of
   infection likely biliary source s/p ERCP, but concern for urinary
   source and VRE given history of prostatitis, introduction through the
   skin given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine cultures
   - continue on day 3 of vancomycin 1g q12 hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 3 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   .
   # hypoxia: continued to have oxygen sats in the mid to high 90s.  CXR
   this AM appears worse with white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain.
   - several episodes of desaturation yesterday
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - chest PT to mobilize secretions does not appear to be improving
   condition, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - trial with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   unsuccessful
   - talk to family about bronch should conservative management fail
   - continue with antibiotics
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - continues to be in sinus, rate in the low 100s
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal SBP >
   90
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward with the exeption of t bili.  Remains
   jaundiced.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs; duct has been
   cleared so should start to fall, if continues to rise, will discuss
   about possible stent insertion but this discussion is premature at this
   point.
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   should levels continue to remain elevated
   - uanble to get CXR yesterday bc pt unable to stay still
   - gave 1L NS bolus in AM, another 500 cc in PM to maintain BPs,
   maintained good UOP

   Code status: DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate).  Confirmed with HCP.
   Disposition: ICU today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR and atelectasis. The patient has a severe infection, likely caused by MRSA bacteremia, and has developed several complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's infection is likely to worsen, leading to sepsis, which can cause organ failure, hypotension, and even death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's atelectasis and possible aspiration pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and even death.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's questionable encephalopathy can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, coma, and even death.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's cholestasis and transaminitis can lead to liver failure, which can cause coagulopathy, jaundice, and even death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and sepsis can lead to acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's cholestasis and liver dysfunction can lead to coagulopathy, which can cause bleeding and bruising.
8. Infection-related complications: The patient's MRSA bacteremia can lead to complications such as endocarditis, abscesses, and septic shock.

The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent these complications and improve their condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Temperature did not spike as high
   overnight, currently afebrile, with downtrending WBC.  Source of
   infection likely biliary source s/p ERCP, but concern for urinary
   source and VRE given history of prostatitis, introduction through the
   skin given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine cultures
   - continue on day 3 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 3 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR this AM appears worse with white out of the left lung,
   suggest atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to trauma regarding
   intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, potential effusion.
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - chest PT to mobilize secretions does not appear to be improving
   condition, patient will unlikely cooperate with incentive spirometry
   - trial with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask
   unsuccessful
   - s/p bronchoscopy today; repeat CXR did not show improvement in CXR.
   Follow BAL analysis.
   - will pursue CT to help differentiate atelectasis vs effusion
   - continue with antibiotics
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - repeat a fib overnight, given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate
   controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - episodes of hypotension responded well to IV boluses with goal SBP >
   90
   - continue 1L NS boluses for SBP goal > 90
   - urine output has remained robust >30 cc/h
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR and atelectasis. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a gram-positive MRSA bacteremia, which is likely sourced from the biliary tree following ERCP. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and other antibiotics.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has atelectasis/collapse of the left lung, which is likely secondary to trauma from intubation/extubation, barotrauma, pain, and potential effusion.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which are trending downward. The cause is likely related to ERCP with sphincterotomy and removal of gallstones.
4. Anemia: The patient has a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5, which is likely related to anemia of chronic disease.
5. Questionable encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is reportedly at baseline, but an EEG suggested encephalopathy, which is thought to be due to toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.
6. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely related to acute disease, including reintubation/extubation, ERCP, and MRSA bacteremia.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of prostatitis, which may have introduced VRE, and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to intubation/extubation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and other potential sources of infection.
2. IVF boluses to maintain blood pressure > 90 mmHg.
3. Continuous oxygen therapy.
4. Chest PT to mobilize secretions.
5. Trial of intermittent positive pressure noninvasive mask therapy.
6. Bronchoscopy to help differentiate atelectasis vs. effusion.
7. CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary edema or other causes of hypoxia.
8. Monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.
9. Transfusion of blood products as necessary.
10. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and seizure activity.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the ICU team is working to manage his complex medical condition and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo male with history of seizure disorder and with cholelithiasis and
   now admitted to ICU with A-fib, hypoxemia and atelectatsis.   He does
   have persistent elevation in bilirubin through to today concerning for
   persistent obstruction but with (Ap-342 (477), T. Bili 10.8 (11.2)).
   some trend down in liver associated enzymes that have remained
   elevated.  It is very concerning that the patient has had progression
   of complete collapse of left lung.
   1) CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
He has some markers of improvement (WBC
   down, transaminases down), but additional markers such as T. Bili and
   Alk Phos which have been slow to decline
   -Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl to continue
   -Will consult with ERCP to consider timing of repeat intervention
   -If ERCP pursued will  need intubation
at which time intubation would
   be required
   2)Hypoxemia--Due to Atelectasis
this is persistent and severe and
   progressive from 2 days ago.  We are limited in terms of being able to
   recruit patient effort and compliance with interventions such as chest
   PT and cough.  We will have to consider nasal trumpet, [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-tracheal
   suctioning, positioning as possible.
   -If intubated for procedrue will pursue bronchoscopy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder, cholelithiasis, and now admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, hypoxemia, and atelectasis. The patient's condition has worsened, with persistent elevation in bilirubin, transient hypotension, and persistent tachypnea requiring oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholelithiasis has worsened, with complete collapse of the left lung and persistent elevation in bilirubin. This may lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening situations.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's atelectasis and hypoxemia have persisted, which may lead to further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and potentially life-threatening situations.
3. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizure disorder may lead to further seizures, which can be life-threatening, especially if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension overnight may lead to further hypotension, which can be life-threatening, especially if not properly managed.
5. Fever: The patient's fever may lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening situations.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening situations.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics, consulting with ERCP for repeat intervention, and considering nasal trumpet and tracheal suctioning to improve respiratory function. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is being managed in the ICU."

   24 Hour Events:
   - bronch performed, clear airways.  CXR showed little improvement.
   - ordered CT: Complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Temperature did not spike as high
   overnight, currently afebrile, with downtrending WBC.  Source of
   infection may be from pneumonia or biliary source s/p ERCP, also
   concern for urinary source and VRE given history of prostatitis and
   introduction through the skin given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration
   pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - follow urine cultures
   - continue on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 4 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - required to start levophed this AM
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output, which has dwindled down
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - s/p bronchoscopy yesterday; repeat CXR did not show improvement in
   CXR.  Follow BAL analysis.
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  Occurred in the setting of acute disease -
   reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have partial lung
   collapse and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - repeat a fib overnight, given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate
   controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - given 2.5L IVF, but ultimately had to initiate levophed
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, which may be a source of infection. The patient's temperature did not spike overnight, but the WBC count is trending downward. The patient has a history of prostatitis and VRE, which may have been introduced through the skin during IV insertion. The patient is also at risk for urinary source of infection.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's CXR shows whiteout of the left lung, suggesting atelectasis/collapse. The patient has a medium-sized pleural effusion, which may be due to aspiration or pneumonia. The patient's oxygen saturation is high 90s on oxygen facemask, but the patient frequently removes the mask voluntarily.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient has a history of acute disease, including reintubation/extubation and ERCP, which may have contributed to the development of atrial fibrillation. The patient's rate is controlled on dilt gtt, but the patient is still in atrial fibrillation.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, which may be secondary to ERCP with sphincterotomy or medication (Depakote, Zonegram, and Fexofenadine). The patient's liver enzymes are trending downward, but the patient remains jaundiced.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 32 to 28 to 24.5, which is normocytic. The patient's low ferritin and elevated transferrin suggest anemia of chronic disease.
6. Encephalopathy: The patient's EEG suggested encephalopathy, which may be related to toxic/metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.
7. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, which may be exacerbated by the patient's intubation and sedation.
8. Hepatitis: The patient has cholestatic hepatitis, which may be secondary to ERCP with sphincterotomy or medication.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia
* Monitor urine output and follow urine cultures
* Continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
* Repeat a fib overnight
* Treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and text the patient's infection
* Continue to trend liver enzymes and bilirubin
* Avoid hepatotoxins and monitor for signs of worsening liver function
* Continue Keppra for seizure activity
* Monitor for signs of encephalopathy and provide aspiration precautions
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes and maintain fluid balance."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - bronch performed, clear airways.  CXR showed little improvement.
   - ordered CT: Complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - BAL results: no organisms, no pmns on gram stain.  Polys: 91, bands:
   2, lymphs: 1, monos: 0, eos: 1, macro: 5
   - at 9:30PM, went back into a fib with RVR in 150s, pushed metoprolol
   5mg X 3.  1L NS Bolus given.  Rate fluctuating between 110s-130s.
   Placed on esmolol gtt with HR in 130s.  Rate controlled on dilt gtt,
   but still a. fib.  Given 2.5L IVF over course of night in attempt to
   keep SBP >90.
   - at 6:30 AM, started on levophed bc SBP in the 70s not responding to
   fluids.  A line was placed.
   - ERCP recs: because AP is trending down, monitor bili trend.
   Cholestatic process seems to be getting better. If levels remain to
   decrease, ERCP most likely not needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and atelectasis. He underwent ERCP for gallstones and developed sepsis with MRSA bacteremia. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His condition is complicated by hypoxia, anemia, transaminitis, and increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis with MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has focal airspace opacities at the right lung base, which could be due to aspiration or focal pneumonia, and may require antibiotics and respiratory support.
3. Atelectasis: The patient has atelectasis/collapse of the left lung, which may require diuresis and respiratory support.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require blood transfusions and further evaluation to determine the cause.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which may be related to the ERCP procedure or underlying liver disease, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels: The patient has increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels, which may be related to the ERCP procedure or underlying liver disease, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Encephalopathy: The patient has questionable encephalopathy, which may be related to toxic or metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis, and may require further evaluation and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor and manage hypoxia with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
3. Monitor and manage anemia with blood transfusions and further evaluation.
4. Monitor and manage transaminitis with further evaluation and treatment.
5. Monitor and manage increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels with further evaluation and treatment.
6. Monitor and manage encephalopathy with further evaluation and treatment.
7. Consider diuresis and respiratory support for atelectasis.
8. Consider blood products and further evaluation for anemia.
9. Consider further evaluation and treatment for transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels.
10. Consider further evaluation and treatment for encephalopathy."

   - urine cx ([**8-29**], 19): pending
   IMAGING:
   Chest CT ([**9-1**]) prelim
   Complete opacification of the left lung with medium size pleural
   effusion,
   which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia, correlate with clinical
   symptoms.
   Focal airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to
   apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia, and correlation [**Doctor Last Name 6878**] clinical symptoms is
   recommended
   - echo ([**8-30**]):
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis or abscess. Hyperdynamic LV
   systolic function. Normal diastolic function. No significant valvular
   regurgitation seen.
   - CXR: ([**8-31**]): continued left sided collapse of lung/pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Afebrile overnight, with downtrending
   WBC.  Source of infection may be from pneumonia or biliary source s/p
   ERCP, also concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis and introduction through the skin given difficulty with
   Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 4 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - required to start levophed this AM due to SBPs in the 70s.  Will
   attempt to wean.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output, which has dwindled down
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - will stay intubated for at least 24 hours in the setting of
   aggressive diuresis last night and evolving consolidation
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - s/p bronchoscopy yesterday with clear airways; repeat CXR did not
   show improvement in CXR.  Follow BAL analysis.
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   - maintain intubation for at least another 24 hours till we get a
   better picture with his septic picture.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  re-occurred overnight.  Currently rate controlled on
   dilt gtt.  Will attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the
   setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found
   to have left  lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may
   have been contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause
   given his recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - was given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - given 2.5L IVF, but ultimately had to initiate levophed
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   - hemolysis labs wnl
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - bronch performed, clear airways.  CXR showed little improvement.
   - ordered CT: Complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - BAL results: no organisms, no pmns on gram stain.  Polys: 91, bands:
   2, lymphs: 1, monos: 0, eos: 1, macro: 5
   - at 9:30PM, went back into a fib with RVR in 150s, pushed metoprolol
   5mg X 3.  1L NS Bolus given.  Rate fluctuating between 110s-130s.
   Placed on esmolol gtt with HR in 130s.  Rate controlled on dilt gtt,
   but still a. fib.  Given 2.5L IVF over course of night in attempt to
   keep SBP >90.
   - at 6:30 AM, started on levophed bc SBP in the 70s not responding to
   fluids.  A line was placed.
   - ERCP recs: because AP is trending down, monitor bili trend.
   Cholestatic process seems to be getting better. If levels remain to
   decrease, ERCP most likely not needed.
   - 11 PM Hct: 23.8 -> 4AM hct: 24.6
   - 6PM LFTs, alk phos, t bili: all trending down
   - hemolysis labs
   - Vanc trough was low -> decr Vanc interval to q8h
   - PICC was placed
   - remain intubated overnight
   - ordered u/a and urine cx

   - CXR: ([**8-31**]): continued left sided collapse of lung/pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Afebrile overnight, with downtrending
   WBC.  Source of infection may be from pneumonia or biliary source s/p
   ERCP, also concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis and introduction through the skin given difficulty with
   Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 4 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - required to start levophed this AM due to SBPs in the 70s.  Will
   attempt to wean.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output, which has dwindled down
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - will stay intubated for at least 24 hours in the setting of
   aggressive diuresis last night and evolving consolidation
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - s/p bronchoscopy yesterday with clear airways; repeat CXR did not
   show improvement in CXR.  Follow BAL analysis.
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   - maintain intubation for at least another 24 hours till we get a
   better picture with his septic picture.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  re-occurred overnight.  Currently rate controlled on
   dilt gtt.  Will attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the
   setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found
   to have left  lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may
   have been contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause
   given his recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - was given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - given 2.5L IVF, but ultimately had to initiate levophed
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   - hemolysis labs wnl
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted with gallstones and has developed respiratory failure due to volume loss on the left side. He has a history of seizure disorder and was admitted with atrial fibrillation. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and placement of a PICC line and arterial line.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is 96/60 mmHg, heart rate is 98 bpm, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.9, hemoglobin is 7.9 g/dL, and platelet count is 205 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an ALT of 45 and AST of 24.
* Imaging studies: A chest CT scan shows consolidation throughout the left lung with a small effusion, and a chest X-ray shows unchanged opacification on the left side.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a range of medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, leading to further compromise of his lung function.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he undergoes invasive procedures.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of medications such as diltiazem and metoprolol may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may indicate anemia, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for complications, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies closely, and to adjust his medications and treatments as necessary to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and has been on invasive ventilation since August 31st. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which has been resolved. Additionally, the patient has cholecystitis, calculous, hypotension (not shock), bacteremia, and a seizure without status epilepticus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 50% FiO2. The patient's respiratory support includes a CMV/ASSIST ventilator mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including bronchoscopy, placement of a PICC line, and insertion of an arterial line. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the ventilator settings are not optimized, or if there is a delay in addressing underlying causes such as pneumonia or sepsis.
2. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and presence of a PICC line increase the risk of infection, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may recur, and the patient may be at risk for other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which may worsen if the patient's condition deteriorates.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT and PTT may indicate a coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and lack of oral intake may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which may impair immune function and worsen the patient's overall condition.
7. Psychosocial issues: The patient's DNR status and prolonged ICU stay may lead to psychosocial issues, including anxiety, depression, and existential distress."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted with gallstones and later developed respiratory failure due to volume loss on the left, returned to atrial fibrillation, and had a seizure disorder. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 228.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving diltiazem drips. The patient's blood pressure is 96/60 mmHg, and the heart rate is 98 bpm.
* Neurological: The patient had a seizure disorder and is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not mentioned.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has cholecystitis with calculi and is receiving supportive care.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 21 mg/dL.
* Hematology: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 8.9, and the platelet count is 6.8 K/uL.
* Liver function: The patient's aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is 24 IU/L, and the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is 45 IU/L.
* Electrolytes: The patient's potassium level is 4.1 mEq/L, and the sodium level is 137 mEq/L.
* Blood cultures: The patient has bacteremia, and the cultures are pending.
* Imaging: The patient has a chest CT scan showing consolidation throughout the left lung with a small effusion, and a chest X-ray showing unchanged opacification on the left.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and the patient is on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
* Neurological complications: The patient's seizure disorder and sedation increase the risk of neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, and respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cholecystitis and calculi increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as pancreatitis, perforation, and sepsis.
* Renal complications: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and potential sepsis increase the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and potential bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of hematological complications such as bleeding, anemia, and sepsis.
* Infection: The patient's bacteremia and potential sepsis increase the risk of infection and sepsis.

Based on the patient's current condition, the plan of care includes:

* Continuing supportive care for the patient's respiratory failure, including invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Weaning the patient off pressors and continuing IV fluids as needed.
* Continuing antibiotics for the patient's bacteremia.
* Weaning the patient off diltiazem drips as possible.
* Continuing seizure medication as prescribed.
* Monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels and adjusting therapy as needed.
* Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting therapy as needed.
* Monitoring the patient's hematological status and adjusting therapy as needed.
* Monitoring the patient for signs of infection and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to volume loss on the left, returned to atrial fibrillation, and has a history of seizure disorder and gallstones.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg. He is intubated and sedated, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, as well as an elevated white blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. His chest CT scan shows consolidation throughout the left lung, and his chest X-ray shows unchanged opacification on the left.

The patient's medications include midazolam, fentanyl, diltiazem, and norepinephrine, among others. He is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further decline in oxygenation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to further cardiac compromise and increased risk of stroke.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder can worsen, leading to further neurological compromise and increased risk of seizure-related complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cholecystitis and gallstones can lead to further gastrointestinal complications, including pancreatitis and perforation.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressors increase the risk of hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further cardiac compromise and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and devices increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infection.
8. Organ dysfunction: The patient's underlying conditions and medications increase the risk of organ dysfunction, including renal and hepatic failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient has a history of cholecystitis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, which has resolved. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, fever, and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F) to 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm (92-124 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/84 mmHg (87 mmHg) to 90/53 mmHg (65 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (17-20 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. The patient has a PICC line, arterial line, and 20-gauge line inserted for various purposes.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 8.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 93 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further decline in oxygenation and ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may indicate cardiac instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cholecystitis and possible stress ulceration may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of invasive lines may increase the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including cholecystitis, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, anemia, coagulopathy, and potential renal insufficiency. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, as well as vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/84 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show improving trends in their blood counts, with a white blood cell count of 8.9 K/uL and a platelet count of 93 K/uL. The patient's renal function is also improving, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure make them at risk for developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's potential renal insufficiency could worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is rising, which could lead to bleeding complications or thrombotic events.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen, leading to heart failure, stroke, or cardiac arrest.
7. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis could worsen, leading to gangrene, perforation, or abscess formation.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and the use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) could lead to malnutrition and related complications.
9. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure make them at risk for developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
10. Code Status: The patient's DNR code status could lead to conflicts or challenges in providing optimal care, particularly if the patient's condition worsens."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm (normal range: 92-124 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/84 mmHg (normal range: 90-120/60-80 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (normal range: 17-20 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient has a history of:

* Cholecystitis, calculous
* Hypotension, which is being managed with pressors
* Bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin
* Atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with a diltiazem drip
* Renal insufficiency, which is likely related to hypotension and medications
* Seizure, without status epilepticus, which is being managed with current regimen
* Respiratory failure, which is being managed with antibiotics and weaning of ventilator support
* Anemia, which is stable
* Coagulopathy, with an increasing INR, which may indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

The patient has a number of lab results, including:

* White blood cell count: 8.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.6%
* Platelet count: 93 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 2.4 mg/dL
* Albumin: 1.8 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* LDH: 178 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's chest CT scan shows near complete left lung consolidation and small bilateral effusions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing supportive care and monitoring lab results
* Weaning pressors and IV fluids as tolerated
* Continuing vancomycin for bacteremia
* Weaning diltiazem drip as possible
* Following up on renal insufficiency and considering a DIC work-up
* Continuing current regimen for seizure management
* Weaning ventilator support as tolerated
* Following up on anemia and coagulopathy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function
* Development of septic shock
* Progression of renal insufficiency to acute kidney injury
* Development of DIC
* Further deterioration of coagulopathy
* Development of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Further deterioration of nutritional status
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient remains on pressors for hypotension and is being weaned as tolerated.
* They have near complete left lung consolidation and small bilateral effusions on their Chest CT scan.
* The patient has cholecystitis, calculous, which is being managed with supportive care and monitoring of lab results.
* They have bacteremia, which is being treated with vancomycin.
* The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with a diltiazem drip and weaning as possible.
* They have developed new renal insufficiency, which is being monitored.
* The patient has had a seizure, without status epilepticus, and their current regimen is being continued.
* They have respiratory failure, acute, which is being managed with antibiotics and weaning of ventilation as tolerated.
* The patient has anemia, which is being monitored and managed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, leading to increased risk of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the bacteremia.
* Progression of the patient's renal insufficiency to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and need for anticoagulation.
* Potential for further seizures or status epilepticus due to the patient's seizure history.
* Increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged ventilation.
* Potential for further complications related to the patient's cholecystitis, such as gangrene or perforation of the gallbladder.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their management plan accordingly to minimize the risk of these complications and optimize their outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including:

1. Cholecystitis, calculous: The patient is receiving supportive care, and laboratory results are being monitored.
2. Hypotension: The patient is being treated with pressors and IV fluids as needed. Weaning of pressors and IV fluids will be done as tolerated.
3. Bacteremia: The patient is receiving vancomycin, and antibiotic therapy will be continued.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is being treated with a diltiazem drip, and weaning will be done as possible.
5. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient's current regimen will be continued.
6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is receiving antibiotics and will be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and laboratory results will be monitored.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pressors, and anticoagulants. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 115 bpm (92-124 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/84 mmHg (87-116/84 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (17-20 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 25 mmHg
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are also provided.

The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line and an arterial line, and is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is being cared for in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure may increase the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen or lead to other cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen or lead to respiratory arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure may increase the risk of developing other infections.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level may indicate early signs of renal failure.
7. Metabolic disturbances: The patient's glucose and electrolyte levels may indicate metabolic disturbances that need to be addressed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple comorbidities to prevent potential complications and improve their outcome."

   CT Chest:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Small left pleural effusion with complete opacification of the left
   lung
   with patent airways, could be due to aspiration or pneumonia. Please
   correlate with clinical symptoms. Mild focal opacities at the right
   lung base
   are noted as well. Please correlate with clinical symptoms.
   2. Gallstones, and trace ascites in the abdomen.
   CXR: white out of left lung
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Source of infection may be from
   pneumonia or biliary source s/p ERCP, also concern for urinary source
   and VRE given history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin
   given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 5 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**]) ->
   however, Vanc trough was high, will d/c for now and recheck level
   before giving another dose
   - Continue day 5 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - continue levophed, will attempt to wean
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - continue mechanical ventilation -> wean to PS [**4-22**] today
   - f/u cultures
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   .
   # ARF: Cr bumped up to 2.4 up from 0.7.  Diff incl prerenal, intrinsic,
   postrenal, most likely intrinsic (ATN) from hypotension and A fib
   w/RVR.
   - urine lytes
   - continue to monitor
   - consider renal c/s in future
   .
   # A fib with RVR: currently back on dilt gtt, in low 100s.   Will
   attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the setting of acute
   disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have left
   lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - give IVF boluses as needed
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now stable around 24.
   Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   - hemolysis labs wnl
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continue at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   - Neuro will see pt is there are any active Neuro issues
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR and atelectasis. He had undergone ERCP for gallstones in the biliary tree and was found to have a small left pleural effusion with complete opacification of the left lung, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia. He also had a medium-sized pleural effusion and focal airspace opacities at the right lung base. He was found to have MRSA bacteremia, and the source of infection may be from pneumonia, biliary source, or urinary source.

The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is receiving IV fluids and diuretics to manage his fluid status. He has also been diagnosed with transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels, which may be secondary to the ERCP procedure.

The patient's anemia is normocytic and is likely due to anemia of chronic disease. He has also been diagnosed with questionable encephalopathy, which may be related to toxic or metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has MRSA bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. ARDS: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral lung opacities may indicate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels may indicate hepatic failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's AKI may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's lung opacities may indicate pneumonia, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Aspiration: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of aspiration.
7. Encephalopathy: The patient's questionable encephalopathy may worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia.
2. Manage hypoxia with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
3. Monitor and manage AKI with IV fluids and diuretics.
4. Monitor and manage transaminitis and increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels.
5. Monitor and manage anemia.
6. Consider renal c/s in the future.
7. Continue to monitor and manage encephalopathy.
8. Consider 1:1 sitter for seizure activity.
9. Continue to trend hematocrit and transfuse above 21.
10. Continue to monitor and manage liver enzymes."

   are noted as well. Please correlate with clinical symptoms.
   2. Gallstones, and trace ascites in the abdomen.
   CXR:
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Afebrile overnight, with downtrending
   WBC.  Source of infection may be from pneumonia or biliary source s/p
   ERCP, also concern for urinary source and VRE given history of
   prostatitis and introduction through the skin given difficulty with
   Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 4 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**])
   - Continue day 4 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - required to start levophed this AM due to SBPs in the 70s.  Will
   attempt to wean.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output, which has dwindled down
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - will stay intubated for at least 24 hours in the setting of
   aggressive diuresis last night and evolving consolidation
   - currently satting high 90s on oxygen facemask.  Frequently takes off
   mask voluntarily.
   - s/p bronchoscopy yesterday with clear airways; repeat CXR did not
   show improvement in CXR.  Follow BAL analysis.
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   - maintain intubation for at least another 24 hours till we get a
   better picture with his septic picture.
   .
   # A fib with RVR:  re-occurred overnight.  Currently rate controlled on
   dilt gtt.  Will attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the
   setting of acute disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found
   to have left  lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may
   have been contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause
   given his recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - was given IVF boluses to maintain SBP, rate controlled on dilt gtt
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   - given 2.5L IVF, but ultimately had to initiate levophed
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - ERCP recs: continue to watch bili, alk phos, LFTs.  Trending down and
   no need for ercp given downtrending results
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now 24.5.  Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   - hemolysis labs wnl

   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continued at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter

   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure

   hepatitis.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress and potential medical complications:

**Summary of Progress:**

* The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and atelectasis.
* He underwent ERCP for gallstones and was found to have MRSA bacteremia, which may have been secondary to pneumonia or biliary source.
* He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a CXR showing complete opacification of the left lung and medium-sized pleural effusion.
* He is also receiving antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia, and his liver enzymes are trending downward.
* He has a history of anemia, which is likely due to anemia of chronic disease, and is being treated with iron supplements.
* He has also been experiencing seizure activity, which is being managed with Keppra and Diazepam.
* His mental status is reportedly at baseline, but he is being monitored for potential encephalopathy.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis: The patient has MRSA bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis if not adequately treated.
* Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows complete opacification of the left lung, which may be due to aspiration or pneumonia.
* Atelectasis: The patient's CXR also shows atelectasis, which may be due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
* Hepatic cholestasis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be secondary to ERCP or other medications.
* Encephalopathy: The patient's EEG suggests encephalopathy, which may be due to toxic or metabolic effects of cholestatic hepatitis.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of chronic disease, but may also be exacerbated by other medical conditions.
* Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity is being managed, but may be a sign of underlying neurological complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to manage his respiratory failure, but may also increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, atelectasis, and encephalopathy. Close monitoring and management of his medical condition are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   2. Gallstones, and trace ascites in the abdomen.
   CXR: white out of left lung
   Assessment and Plan
   35yo M with PMH of [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome, s/p ERCP for gallstones in
   the biliary tree, transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with
   RVR and atelectasis.
   .
   # sepsis: gram MRSA bacteremia.  Source of infection may be from
   pneumonia or biliary source s/p ERCP, also concern for urinary source
   and VRE given history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin
   given difficulty with Ivs, aspiration pneumonia given
   intubation/extubation.
   - continue on day 5 of vancomycin 1g q8h hours (day 1: [**8-29**]) ->
   however, Vanc trough was high, will d/c for now and recheck level
   before giving another dose
   - Continue day 5 of 5 day course of Cipro 400mg IV q12 and flagyl 500mg
   IV q8h this AM (day 1: [**8-29**] of 5 day course).  Patient has
   pen/cephalosporin allergy.
   - echo does not suggest endocarditis, but suboptimal study
   - Has 2 peripheral Ivs for access and PICC line placed yesterday
   - continue levophed, will attempt to wean.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed to keep SBP > 90
   - follow urine output
   - follow cultures
   .
   # hypoxia: CXR continues to show white out of the left lung, suggest
   atelectasis/collapse.  Likely secondary to pneumonia vs. aspiration
   pneumonia.  Medium sized pleural effusion present.  Remains intubated.
   - continue mechanical ventilation -> wean to PS [**4-22**] today
   - f/u cultures
   - CT showed complete opacification of the left lung with medium size
   pleural effusion, which could be due to aspiration or pneumonia.  Focal
   airspace opacities at the right lung base, could be due to apsiration,
   or focal pneumonia.  Did not recommend tapping pleural effusion.
   - continue with antibiotics as above
   - unable to diurese pleural fluid given hypotension
   - keep left side up
   .
   # ARF: Cr bumped up to 3.6 up from 0.7.  Diff incl prerenal, intrinsic,
   postrenal, most likely intrinsic (ATN) from hypotension and A fib
   w/RVR.
   - urine lytes
   - continue to monitor
   - consider renal c/s in future
   .
   # A fib with RVR: currently back on dilt gtt, in low 100s.   Will
   attempt to wean today if tolerated.  Occurred in the setting of acute
   disease - reintubation/extubation and ERCP, now found to have left
   lung consolidation and MRSA bacteremia, all of  which may have been
   contributors.  Also considering volume depletion as a cause given his
   recent hx of poor PO intake.
   - give IVF boluses as needed
   - No known history of a. fib in the past.  No underlying pulmonary
   disease but questionable hx of cardiomyopathy.
   - treat tachy with IVF, pain control, and txt his infection
   .
   # transaminitis, increased alk phos/total bili:  s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy on [**8-28**] showing an impacted stone in the major papilla
   and with successful removal of over 10 gallstones.  Hepatic cholestasis
   may also be secondary to depakote or fexofenadine medication.
   - liver enzymes trending downward.  Remains jaundiced.  Will continue
   to trend.
   - f/u ERCP recs
   - avoid hepatotoxins; depakote, zonegram and fexofenadine have been
   d/c'ed.
   - Hepatitis serologies all negative
   - hepatology signed off
   .
   # anemia: drop in hematocrit from 32 to 28 to now stable around 24.
   Normocytic.
   - low fe, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin suggests anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - prior folate, B12 WNL.
   - continue to trend hematocrit; transfuse above 21
   - hemolysis labs wnl
   .
   #. [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gastaut Syndrome: followed by neuro and seizure activity
   appears to be at baseline.
   - Keppra continue at 1500mg IV BID.  Will change to PO if patient is
   able to tolerate (has had successful PO intake when meds mixed with
   tomato juice)
   - duazepan 10mg IM q6h prn seizure longer than 5 minutes of >3h
   - may need 1:1 sitter
   - Neuro will see pt is there are any active Neuro issues
   .
   # Questionable encephalopathy: Spoke to mother, who reports patient is
   at baseline mental status with no changes.  EEG suggested
   encephalopathy, and per neurology, unlikely related to seizure
   activity.  Suggested to be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic
   hepatitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - dilt gtt restarted at about 10am as he went back to Afib with RVR,
   also given IVF bolus ->remains on gtt
   - Cr bumped to 3.2 -> this AM 3.6, likely ATN given hypotension in the
   setting of sepsis.  Also vanc trough was 46.4.  UA and urine lytes
   sent, hold off on renal consult -> FeNa was 2%
   - vanc held, recheck trough tomorrow morning
   - INR elevated at 2.0, heparin was changed from TID to [**Hospital1 **] -> then dc'd
   - ERCP recs: follow daily LFTs, t bili decreasing, INR 1.9 watch for GI
   bleed
   - low UOP -> gave 500cc NS

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of Gastaut Syndrome, who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with RVR and atelectasis. He had undergone ERCP for gallstones and was found to have MRSA bacteremia, which may be due to pneumonia or a biliary source. He is also at risk for urinary source and VRE given his history of prostatitis and introduction through the skin. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show a high creatinine level, indicating acute kidney injury (ATN), and a low urine output. His liver enzymes are trending downward, but he remains jaundiced. He has anemia, which is likely due to anemia of chronic disease, and is being treated with Keppra for seizure activity.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: Gram MRSA bacteremia
2. Hypoxia: Atelectasis/collapse of the left lung
3. ARF: Acute kidney injury (ATN)
4. A fib with RVR: Atrial fibrillation with RVR
5. Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes
6. Anemia: Normocytic anemia
7. Questionable encephalopathy: EEG suggested encephalopathy, which may be due to toxic/metabolic effect of cholestatic hepatitis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Progression of sepsis to septic shock, organ failure, or death
2. Hypoxia: Pneumonia, atelectasis, or collapse of the left lung
3. ARF: Progression of acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease
4. A fib with RVR: Progression of atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation
5. Transaminitis: Progression of liver dysfunction to liver failure or death
6. Anemia: Progression of anemia to severe anemia, requiring blood transfusions
7. Questionable encephalopathy: Progression of encephalopathy to coma, brain death, or death.

ICU care plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia
2. Monitor and manage sepsis
3. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean as tolerated
4. Monitor and manage ARF
5. Monitor and manage atrial fibrillation
6. Monitor and manage transaminitis
7. Monitor and manage anemia
8. Continue Keppra for seizure activity
9. Consider renal consult for further management of ARF
10. Consider hepatology consult for further management of transaminitis
11. Continue to trend laboratory results and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo male with [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut syndrome now with admittion with
   cholelithiasis and obstruction with resulting cholecystitis now with
   worsening respiratory status with atelectasis and collapse of left lung
   seen requiring intubation and bronchoscopy.  Now he has persistent and
   worsening sepsis from likely from pulmonary source and this is now
   complicated by worsening renal failure through to this morning.  This
   represents a substantial and persistent worsening despite optimal
   efforts to support patient in the setting of acute illness
he has had
   cholecystitis initially but now with Staph Sepsis and persistence of
   substantial multi-lobar pneumonia.
   Patient had quality of life which had moved to a poor quality and not
   of a level that patient or his mother would continue to consider worth
   living
and this was before the acute illness.  With the evolution of
   significant and persistent insult of sepsis and respiratory failure
   patient has expected prolonged course with intubation, concern for need
   for tracheostomy and with the possibility of not being able to return
   to previous
unacceptable baseline the patient
s mother would request
   specifically that we move to CMO given likely prolonged course and
   limited expectation of being able to return to previous functional
   status.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Significant pneumonia and consolidation and
   having need for ongoing A/C support and pneumonia treatment.
   -Continue A/C
   -Move to right side down as possible.
   -Suction PRN
   -Will treat for PNA for 8 days with broad spectrum antibiotics
   2)Sepsis-Likely pulmonary source at this time, persistent hypotension
   -Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl
   -Norepinephrine
   3)Cholecystitis-
   -Improving lab studies
   4)Seizure Disorder
   Keppra
   5)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likely secondary to sepsis with pre-renal insult and has been
   refractory to support thus far.
   -Will maintain adequate volume
   -Will maintain adequate BP support
   -have discussed extensively with patient
s family that we would
   consider further testing to evaluate for source

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo male with [**Location (un) 8891**]-Gestaut syndrome now with admittion with
   cholelithiasis and obstruction with resulting cholecystitis now with
   worsening respiratory status with atelectasis and collapse of left lung
   seen requiring intubation and bronchoscopy.  Now he has persistent and
   worsening sepsis from likely from pulmonary source and this is now
   complicated by worsening renal failure through to this morning.  This
   represents a substantial and persistent worsening despite optimal
   efforts to support patient in the setting of acute illness
he has had
   cholecystitis initially but now with Staph Sepsis and persistence of
   substantial multi-lobar pneumonia.
   Patient had quality of life which had moved to a poor quality and not
   of a level that patient or his mother would continue to consider worth
   living
and this was before the acute illness.  With the evolution of
   significant and persistent insult of sepsis and respiratory failure
   patient has expected prolonged course with intubation, concern for need
   for tracheostomy and with the possibility of not being able to return
   to previous
unacceptable baseline the patient
s mother would request
   specifically that we move to CMO given likely prolonged course and
   limited expectation of being able to return to previous functional
   status.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Significant pneumonia and consolidation and
   having need for ongoing A/C support and pneumonia treatment.
   -Continue A/C
   -Move to right side down as possible.
   -Suction PRN
   -Will treat for PNA for 8 days with broad spectrum antibiotics
   2)Sepsis-Likely pulmonary source at this time, persistent hypotension
   -Vanco/Cipro/Flagyl
   -Norepinephrine
   3)Cholecystitis-
   -Improving lab studies
   4)Seizure Disorder

   5)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likely secondary to sepsis with pre-renal insult and has been
   refractory to support thus far.
   -Will maintain adequate volume
   -Will maintain adequate BP support
   -have discussed extensively with patient
s family that we would
   consider further testing to evaluate for source

Based on the provided medical progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 35-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and respiratory failure. He has developed atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hypotension. He has a history of seizure disorder and has been experiencing worsening renal failure. His condition has deteriorated significantly, and he is now on mechanical ventilation with persistent hypotension and sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalance, and elevated liver enzymes. His imaging studies reveal persistent consolidation of the left lung and small effusion.

The patient's family has requested that he be moved to comfort measures only (CMO) status, given his poor quality of life and limited expectation of returning to his previous functional status.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has developed significant pneumonia and consolidation, requiring ongoing mechanical ventilation and pneumonia treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, likely from a pulmonary source, with persistent hypotension and refractory to support.
3. Cholecystitis: The patient's cholecystitis is improving, but he still has persistent inflammation.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to sepsis and pre-renal insult, and has been refractory to support.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and has had a recent seizure.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which has resolved.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and pneumonia treatment.
2. Move to right side down as possible.
3. Suction PRN.
4. Treat for PNA for 8 days with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Continue sepsis management with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl.
6. Maintain adequate volume and blood pressure support.
7. Consider further testing to evaluate for source of sepsis.
8. Move to CMO status after discussions with social work.

The patient's disposition is ICU, and his total time spent in the ICU is 45 minutes."
