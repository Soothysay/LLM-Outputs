   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum and urine cultures pending.
   Patient was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen
   shows distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with
   some mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   overnight requiring bear hugger.
   -monitor WBC and diff
   Respiratory Failure: Patient on AC 500/8/60%.  PCO2 on ventilator is
   33.  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely prerenal in etiology
   secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum and urine cultures pending.
   Patient was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen
   shows distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with
   some mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   overnight requiring bear hugger.
   -monitor WBC and diff
   Respiratory Failure: Patient on AC 500/8/60%.  PCO2 on ventilator is
   33.  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely prerenal in etiology
   secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Blood pressures in the 90s systolic on arrival to the
   intensive care unit.  Patient febrile, tachycardiac with a bandemia and
   a lactic acidosis.  Likely etiology is right sided pneumonia.  Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation to the emergency
   room but CT abdomen preliminarily is negative. She has now received
   over 5 liters normal saline with improvement in her blood pressure.
   She now has a central line in place.
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from emergency room
   - currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   - sputum culture if possible
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate to ensure improvement (now down to 5.1)
   - vasopressors as necessary to maintain blood pressure
   - hematocrit is elevated so no indication for transfusion
   Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation.  PCO2 on ventilator is 40.
   Will wean oxygen as tolerated. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   - continue ventilation at current settins
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - repeat cardiac enzymes in AM
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF as above, monitor electrolytes, NGT in place so will start
   tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin
   Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Blood pressures in the 90s systolic on arrival to the
   intensive care unit.  Patient febrile, tachycardiac with a bandemia and
   a lactic acidosis.  Likely etiology is right sided pneumonia.  Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation to the emergency
   room but CT abdomen preliminarily is negative. She has now received
   over 5 liters normal saline with improvement in her blood pressure.
   She now has a central line in place.
   - follow up blood and urine cultures from emergency room
   - currently on vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin for hospital
   acquired pneumonia
   - sputum culture if possible
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate to ensure improvement (now down to 5.1)
   - vasopressors as necessary to maintain blood pressure
   - hematocrit is elevated so no indication for transfusion
   Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation.  PCO2 on ventilator is 40.
   Will wean oxygen as tolerated. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   - continue ventilation at current settins
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - repeat cardiac enzymes in AM
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF as above, monitor electrolytes, NGT in place so will start
   tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who presents to the ICU with pneumonia and septic physiology. She has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheters, and arterial lines. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 127/50 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, and respiratory rate of 22 inspirations per minute. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and lactic acidosis, suggesting septic shock. She has received over 5 liters of normal saline with improvement in her blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient's septic physiology, bandemia, and lactic acidosis suggest a high risk of sepsis and septic shock. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.6 to 2.0, indicating AKI. IVF boluses and close monitoring of her creatinine level are necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory failure require close monitoring of her respiratory status, including her oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and peak inspiratory pressure.
4. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG shows ST depressions in the setting of sinus tachycardia, which may indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. Repeat EKG and cardiac enzymes are necessary to monitor for cardiac complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires close monitoring and control to prevent further complications.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia and intubation make it difficult to assess her mental status. Holding her anticholinergic medications and monitoring her mental status are necessary.
7. Nutrition and Glycemic Control: The patient requires close monitoring of her nutrition and glycemic control to prevent malnutrition and hyperglycemia.
8. Lines and Catheters: The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, which require close monitoring for complications such as infection, bleeding, and dislodgment.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient requires prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her septic physiology, respiratory failure, AKI, and other complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum and urine cultures pending.
   Patient was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen
   shows distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with
   some mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   overnight requiring bear hugger.
   -monitor WBC and diff
   Respiratory Failure: Patient on AC 500/8/60%.  PCO2 on ventilator is
   33.  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely prerenal in etiology
   secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

   MICU Attending Coverage Addendum
   I have reviewed the pertinent history and labs and have examined the
   patient. I was physically present with the MICU team for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I agree with the note above,
   including the assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the
   following:
   Overnight the patient was resuscitate with fluids for a low CVP and
   with this her BP is better and extremities now warm and Levophed being
   titrated down.  Lactate also trending down and U.O, somewhat better.
   On exam: Tm=101.4, P=71, BP=112/50, CVP=14, Po2=99 on 60% fi02  Sedated
   on vent Lungs show bronchia bs over RLL and to lesser extent at left
   base.
   Lab: WBC ony 7.8 but 28% bands   CXR: RLL infiltrate and ? left
   effusion vs infiltrate  Cortisol >40.  Ucx ngtd  BCx [**Year (4 digits) **] but not yet
   identified.
   Problems:
   1.       [**Name2 (NI) **] bacteremia and septic shock, improving with fluids,
   pressors, and abx (Aztreonam, Vanc, Levo, Gent), ? from lung or
   bladder, or abdominal source
   2.       RLL pneumonia
   3.       Renal insufficiency
   4.       EKG changes, likely demand ischemia
   5.       Prior DNR, currently reversed
   6.       Abd wall thickening on CT
   Plan:
   1.       Change fluids from RL to D5
   2.       Wean Fi02, levophed,  versed, and fentanyl
   3.       Follow EKG
   4.       Continue antibiotics with gent trough

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum and urine cultures pending.
   Patient was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen
   shows distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with
   some mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   overnight requiring bear hugger.
   -monitor WBC and diff
   Respiratory Failure: Patient on AC 500/8/60%.  PCO2 on ventilator is
   33.  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6.  Likely prerenal in etiology
   secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

   MICU Attending Coverage Addendum
   I have reviewed the pertinent history and labs and have examined the
   patient. I was physically present with the MICU team for the key
   portions of the services provided.  I agree with the note above,
   including the assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the
   following:
   Overnight the patient was resuscitate with fluids for a low CVP and
   with this her BP is better and extremities now warm and Levophed being
   titrated down.  Lactate also trending down and U.O, somewhat better.
   On exam: Tm=101.4, P=71, BP=112/50, CVP=14, Po2=99 on 60% fi02  Sedated
   on vent Lungs show bronchia bs over RLL and to lesser extent at left
   base.
   Lab: WBC ony 7.8 but 28% bands   CXR: RLL infiltrate and ? left
   effusion vs infiltrate  Cortisol >40.  Ucx ngtd  BCx [**Year (4 digits) **] but not yet
   identified.
   Problems:
   1.       [**Name2 (NI) **] bacteremia and septic shock, improving with fluids,
   pressors, and abx (Aztreonam, Vanc, Levo, Gent), ? from lung or
   bladder, or abdominal source
   2.       RLL pneumonia
   3.       Renal insufficiency
   4.       EKG changes, likely demand ischemia
   5.       Prior DNR, currently reversed
   6.       Abd wall thickening on CT
   Plan:
   1.       Change fluids from RL to D5
   2.       Wean Fi02, levophed,  versed, and fentanyl
   3.       Follow EKG
   4.       Continue antibiotics with gent trough

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, with a diagnosis of bacteremia and septic physiology. The current differential includes pneumonia, urosepsis, and GI source. Cultures are pending, but the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, aztreonam, and gentamycin).
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and a PCO2 of 33. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 2.0, which is likely prerenal in etiology due to volume depletion and septic shock.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an elevated potassium level and is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
5. EKG Changes: The patient has ST depressions on her EKG, which is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension.
6. Dementia: The patient has dementia and is intubated, making it difficult to assess her mental status.
7. Distended Abdomen: The patient has a distended abdomen, which is likely due to ileus secondary to acute illness.
8. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.4°F, which is being monitored.
9. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with antihypertensive medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's EKG changes may indicate cardiac ischemia, which may lead to myocardial infarction.
6. Infection: The patient's distended abdomen and fever may indicate a secondary infection, which may lead to further complications.
7. Poor wound healing: The patient's distended abdomen and ileus may lead to poor wound healing and increased risk of surgical site infections.

In terms of the plan of care, the patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and pressors to manage her septic shock. The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored, and efforts will be made to wean her off the ventilator. The patient's electrolyte imbalance will be closely monitored and managed, and the patient will be followed for signs of cardiac ischemia. The patient's distended abdomen will be managed with bowel rest and nutrition, and the patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   blood. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM, monitor fever curve-
   patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight requiring
   bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop
   -          will check crit this afternoon
   -          guiac stools (if has any), send anemia studies
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presents to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis. She has a positive blood culture for E. coli and a positive urine culture for E. coli. She is currently on antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, and levofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient has several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures are positive for E. coli, which indicates a bacterial infection. She is receiving antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled, and she may require further treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which indicates that she is not able to breathe on her own. She may require further respiratory support, such as non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which indicates kidney damage. She may require dialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may require treatment with antihypertensive medications.
5. Ileus: The patient has a distended abdomen and has not passed stool or gas since admission, which may indicate an ileus. This may require treatment with medications or other interventions.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may require treatment with electrolyte supplements or other interventions.
7. Cardiac issues: The patient's EKG shows ST depressions, which may indicate cardiac ischemia or other cardiac issues. She may require further cardiac testing or treatment.

In terms of potential medical complications that can arise, the patient is at risk for:

1. Further sepsis: The patient's infection may not be fully controlled, and she may require further treatment or interventions to manage the infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient may require further respiratory support or interventions, such as non-invasive ventilation or ECMO.
3. AKI: The patient's kidney function may continue to deteriorate, which may require dialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure may continue to be elevated, which may require treatment with antihypertensive medications or other interventions.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac issues may worsen, which may require cardiac arrest management or other interventions.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place with coffee ground emesis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place with coffee ground emesis

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who presents to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 420 mL, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.32, PaO2 of 293, and PaCO2 of 39.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient is hypertensive with a blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg and tachycardic with a heart rate of 77 bpm. The patient's lactate level is 2.6 mmol/L, which is down from 3.4 mmol/L earlier.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.0 mg/dL on admission to 1.5 mg/dL today, suggesting prerenal azotemia secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
* Hepatic status: The patient's liver enzymes are normal.
* Infectious disease: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli cultured from the urine and the [**Year (4 digits) **] non-speciated. The patient's sputum cultures have grown oropharyngeal flora only.
* Gastrointestinal (GI) status: The patient has a distended abdomen, and CT abdomen shows distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with some mild bowel thickening. The patient has not passed stool or gas since admission, which may indicate ileus secondary to acute illness rather than an infectious source.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and the lactate level is still elevated, which increases the risk of septic shock.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and the patient may require further respiratory support.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and the patient may require further monitoring and treatment for AKI.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes are normal, but the patient's liver function should be closely monitored.
* GI complications: The patient's distended abdomen and lack of stool or gas passage may indicate ileus or other GI complications.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular complications, and the patient's EKG changes may suggest demand ischemia.
* Dementia: The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to intubation, and the patient's baseline mental status is unclear.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and the presence of stool in the distal colon may indicate nutritional deficiencies.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored due to the patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
* Continue to provide respiratory support, including CPAP/PSV and oxygen therapy.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide IV fluids and medications as needed to maintain urine output.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and provide electrolyte supplements as needed.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and provide sedation as needed to ensure comfort and safety.
* Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's GI status and provide recommendations for further management.
* Consider consulting a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status and provide recommendations for further management.
* Consider consulting a nephrologist to evaluate the patient's renal status and provide recommendations for further management.
* Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide nutritional supplements as needed to prevent malnutrition.
* Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust the plan as needed to ensure optimal care and outcome."

   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+
   oropharyngeal flora and urine cultures pending. Patient was noted to
   have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows distended
   bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some mild bowel
   thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but patient has not
   passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is chronic diarrhea).
   This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and less likely an
   infectious source. For hypotension the patient received large volume of
   IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed as tolerated
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+
   oropharyngeal flora and urine cultures pending. Patient was noted to
   have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows distended
   bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some mild bowel
   thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but patient has not
   passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is chronic diarrhea).
   This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and less likely an
   infectious source. For hypotension the patient received large volume of
   IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed as tolerated
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis.
* She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and gentamycin, pending the results of sputum and urine cultures.
* The patient's septic physiology is likely due to a combination of pneumonia, urosepsis, and/or gastrointestinal (GI) source, with a distended abdomen and gas/stool in the bowel, but no indication of obstruction.
* She has developed hypotension, which has been treated with large volumes of IV fluids, and her potassium levels have risen, requiring a switch to D5 1/2NS with bicarbonate.
* The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 293, indicating a need for continued respiratory support.
* Her cardiac status is also concerning, with ST depressions on EKG and a rising creatinine level, suggesting prerenal azotemia.
* The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 7.2 mmol/L, magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 2.3 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic physiology may lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
3. GI complications: The patient's distended abdomen and gas/stool in the bowel may lead to GI complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's ST depressions on EKG and rising creatinine level may indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's prerenal azotemia may progress to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
7. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to further infection-related complications, such as bacteremia, endocarditis, or meningitis.

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics pending the results of sputum and urine cultures.
2. Monitor the patient's septic physiology closely, adjusting therapy as necessary.
3. Continue respiratory support, weaning FiO2 as tolerated.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely, repleting as necessary.
5. Consider echocardiography to evaluate cardiac function.
6. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust fluid management accordingly.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
8. Clarify the patient's code status and goals of care with the healthcare proxy.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation as necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and renal function closely, adjusting therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.

   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds

   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, who presents from rehab with pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock due to pneumonia and/or urosepsis, with cultures growing E. coli in the urine and the [**Year (4 digits) **].
* Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to pneumonia and/or aspiration, with a need for CPAP and FiO2 40%.
* ARF: The patient has acute renal failure due to hypotension and septic shock, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL.
* EKG Changes: The patient has EKG changes consistent with demand ischemia due to hypotension and tachycardia.
* Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with IV hydral and metoprolol.
* Dementia: The patient has dementia, which is being managed with Namenda and Aricept, but these medications are being held due to the patient's current condition.
* FEN: The patient is not eating and has high residuals, so tube feedings are being held. The patient is being given IV maintenance fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ failure (e.g., ARF, respiratory failure, cardiac failure)
* Pneumonia-related complications (e.g., respiratory failure, pleural effusion)
* Urosepsis-related complications (e.g., septic shock, acute kidney injury)
* Hypertension-related complications (e.g., cardiac failure, stroke)
* Dementia-related complications (e.g., delirium, falls)
* FEN-related complications (e.g., electrolyte imbalance, dehydration)
* Prophylaxis-related complications (e.g., bleeding, infection)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for sepsis and pneumonia
* Monitoring and managing hypertension

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   blood. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    #) Hematocrit drop
   -          Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool
   studies as patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   -          Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   -          Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    #) Hematocrit drop
   -          Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool
   studies as patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   -          Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   -          Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who presents from rehab with pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's current condition is complicated by the growth of E. coli in her urine and blood cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's septic physiology can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Antibiotic-resistant infections: The growth of E. coli in the patient's urine and blood cultures may indicate antibiotic-resistant infections, which can be challenging to treat.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's distended abdomen, CT findings of distended bladder, and lack of bowel movement since admission may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or obstruction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, initially thought to be due to pneumonia, may require further evaluation and management.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's EKG changes, including ST depressions and sinus tachycardia, may indicate cardiac complications such as demand ischemia or myocardial infarction.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hyponatremia may require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
7. Hematocrit drop: The patient's decreased Hct may indicate blood loss or hemolysis, which requires further evaluation and management.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coffee ground emesis from the NG tube may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires further evaluation and management.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's septic physiology, antibiotic-resistant infections, gastrointestinal complications, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, electrolyte imbalance, hematocrit drop, and gastrointestinal bleeding are all potential medical complications that require careful evaluation and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+
   oropharyngeal flora and urine cultures pending. Patient was noted to
   have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows distended
   bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some mild bowel
   thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but patient has not
   passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is chronic diarrhea).
   This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and less likely an
   infectious source. For hypotension the patient received large volume of
   IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed as tolerated
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop
   -          will check crit this afternoon
   -          guiac stools (if has any), send anemia studies
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait for speciation but until
   then continue to cover broadly. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+
   oropharyngeal flora and urine cultures pending. Patient was noted to
   have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows distended
   bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some mild bowel
   thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but patient has not
   passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is chronic diarrhea).
   This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and less likely an
   infectious source. For hypotension the patient received large volume of
   IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - continue  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin
   - IVF boluses with normal saline to maintain MAP > 65, urine output >
   30 cc/hr, CVP 10-12
   - trend lactate
   - attempt to wean off levophed as tolerated
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop
   -          will check crit this afternoon
   -          guiac stools (if has any), send anemia studies
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and septic physiology. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 104 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Sodium: 142 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.8 mmol/L
* Chloride: 116 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 25.6 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 2.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 161 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock with a differential diagnosis of pneumonia, urosepsis, and gastrointestinal source
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia
* Acute kidney injury (ARF) likely due to prerenal causes
* Hypertension
* Dementia
* Hematocrit drop
* EKG changes with ST depressions and upward trending CE

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and antifungal therapy
* IVF boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg, urine output > 30 cc/hr, and central venous pressure (CVP) 10-12 mmHg
* Trending lactate levels
* Attempting to wean off levophed as tolerated
* Monitoring WBC, CBC, and differential counts
* Following up on sputum and urine cultures
* Weaning FiO2 as tolerated
* Weaning off sedation as tolerated
* Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal ileus
* Trending creatinine levels
* Re-checking EKG and performing echocardiogram if possible
* Holding antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
* Holding namenda and aricept for now due to intubation

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening septic shock and ARF
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to EKG changes
* Delayed recovery from respiratory failure
* Increased risk of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility
* Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections due to prolonged ICU stay."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   blood. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop
   -          will check crit this afternoon
   -          guiac stools (if has any), send anemia studies
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   blood. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - follow up sputum, urine cultures
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the blood
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff - this morning patient dropped crit, monitor
   fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic overnight
   requiring bear hugger.
    Respiratory Failure: Patient on ********  Will wean FIO2 as tolerated
   today. Likely secondary to pneumonia.
   -f/u cultures and continue abx as above
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   -wean off sedation as tolerated- this will also assist with bowel
   motility
    Hematocrit drop
   -          will check crit this afternoon
   -          guiac stools (if has any), send anemia studies
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 from baseline of 0.6 today improved.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO if possible to evaluate for MI or change from prior
   Hypertension:
   - holding all antihypertensives in the setting of hypotension
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN: IVF- D5
 NS, if bicarb trends downward can add [**12-6**]
 amps bicarb.
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place however has had high residuals overnight so should hold
   off on TF until bowel function improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin Day [**2-11**]
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient may not have gag reflex at baseline
   - ABG now and change vent settings accordingly
   - Suction PRN
   -Reposition patient
   -off sedation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - [**Month (only) 60**] restart lisinopril today
   -Increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since [**Hospital1 **] is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.2.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
    FEN:
   - residuals improve, so if not extubated may re-start feeding
   - will continue IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and is currently in the ICU due to septic shock and pneumonia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamicin, and levofloxacin, but the E. coli infection in the urine and blood is not responding to treatment. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Septic shock: The patient's lactate levels have trended down, but the patient remains at risk for further deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on CPAP and O2, but is tachypneic and requires pressure support. The presence of gag reflex is unknown at baseline.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been controlled with hydralazine, but the patient may be experiencing agitation.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped, and the patient has a normocytic normochromic anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or infection.
5. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 2.0 to 1.2, but the patient may still be at risk for further kidney damage.
6. EKG changes: The patient has ST depressions and upward trending CE, which may be due to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension.
7. Dementia: The patient is intubated and it is difficult to assess mental status.
8. FEN: The patient has evidence of stool in the distal colon and may require a fleets enema to improve residuals and allow for tube feedings.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving SC heparin and bowel regimen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of septic shock
2. Respiratory failure requiring intubation
3. Hypertensive crisis
4. Anemia worsening
5. ARF worsening
6. Cardiac complications due to EKG changes
7. Dementia worsening
8. Gastrointestinal complications due to FEN
9. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility
10. Stress ulcer bleeding due to prolonged ICU stay

To address these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy to combat the E. coli infection
2. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values to assess for further deterioration
3. Adjustments to respiratory support as needed
4. Control of hypertension and anemia
5. Monitoring of creatinine levels and consideration of restarting ACEI
6. Further evaluation of EKG changes and cardiac function
7. Assessment of mental status and consideration of restarting dementia medications
8. Monitoring of gastrointestinal function and consideration of FEN
9. Prophylaxis for VTE and stress ulcer bleeding
10. Regular reassessment of the patient's condition and adjustment of treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has a dense paralysis on the right side and is minimally verbal. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with E. coli sepsis. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 155/64 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV ventilator with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 40%. Her laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, including an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further respiratory support or intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of E. coli sepsis is a significant risk factor for organ failure and mortality. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition is essential.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's dense paralysis on the right side and decreased mental status may indicate a neurological complication, such as a stroke or encephalitis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachypnea and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, and close monitoring of her cardiac status is necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of E. coli sepsis may indicate a risk of further infection, and close monitoring of her laboratory results and clinical condition is essential.
6. Nutritional compromise: The patient's obesity and potential inability to eat may lead to nutritional compromise, which can exacerbate her underlying condition.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and potential inability to change positions may increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely.
2. Adjust her respiratory support as necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Consider further neurological evaluation to determine the cause of her paralysis and decreased mental status.
4. Monitor her cardiovascular status closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
5. Continue to treat her E. coli sepsis with antibiotics and close monitoring of her laboratory results.
6. Consider nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), to prevent nutritional compromise.
7. Implement pressure ulcer prevention measures, such as regular turning and repositioning, to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.
   -NGT in place with coffee ground emesis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Current differential includes pneumonia vs. urosepsis
   vs. GI source. Cultures currently growing e. coli in the urine and the
   [**Year (4 digits) **]. Sputum cultures with polys and 4+ oropharyngeal flora. Patient
   was noted to have distended abdomen on presentation, CT abdomen shows
   distended bladder, b/l hydroureters and gas/stool in bowel with some
   mild bowel thickening. There is no indication of obstruction but
   patient has not passed gas/stool since admission (unclear if this is
   chronic diarrhea). This is likely ileus secondary to acute illness and
   less likely an infectious source. For hypotension the patient received
   large volume of IV NS, LR.  Switched to D5 1/2NS w/bicarb d/t rising K
   and Na.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   - lactate this AM 2.6 which is down from 3.4
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
 decreased hct this AM
   monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP Vt 420, PEEP 8, FiO2 40%..
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient would be candidate for extubation if mental status were
   better, currently no gag as per nursing, however unclear if at baseline
   patient has gag
   -off sedation
    Hematocrit drop
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube
   - Ordered iron studies for AM tomorrow
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.5.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed, unlikely to get done over the
   weekend
   - troponins on [**8-17**] were 0.02, 0.03, 0.05
   - no troponins drawn yesterday
   - put in add on troponins for this AM
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - will hold on lisinopril in the setting of acute renal failure
   - written for metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, will continue to uptitrate as
   tolerated by heart rate and [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure and use hydral PRN as needed
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   - will call [**Hospital3 **] today to try to find out what baseline mental
   status is, question as to whether patient has gag at baseline, what her
   baseline orientation is etc
    FEN:
   - pt currently with high residuals so not getting tube feeds
   - will start IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. She has a dense paralysis on the right side and is unable to move spontaneously unless stimulated by nursing staff. She is currently intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. She has a distended abdomen with no indication of obstruction, and a CT abdomen shows distended bladder, bilateral hydroureters, and gas/stool in the bowel with mild bowel thickening.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic physiology is a concern, and the presence of E. coli in her urine and blood cultures suggests a potential source of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.6 to 1.5, and she is at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and she is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk for further hypertensive episodes.
6. Gastrointestinal (GI) complications: The patient's distended abdomen and lack of bowel movement suggest the possibility of GI complications, such as ileus or obstruction.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's EKG changes suggest the possibility of demand ischemia, and her elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiac damage.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's dense paralysis on the right side and lack of spontaneous movement suggest the possibility of neurological complications, such as stroke or spinal cord injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adjusting her antibiotic regimen based on the results of her blood cultures.
3. Consider extubating the patient if her mental status improves and she is able to breathe spontaneously.
4. Continue to monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her fluids and medications as needed.
5. Consider starting a stress ulcer prophylaxis regimen.
6. Monitor her GI status and consider starting a bowel regimen if she is not passing stool.
7. Consider starting a cardiac monitor to monitor her cardiac status.
8. Monitor her neurological status and consider consulting with a neurologist if necessary."

   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin Day [**2-11**]
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient may not have gag reflex at baseline
   - ABG now and change vent settings accordingly
   - Suction PRN
   -Reposition patient
   -off sedation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - [**Month (only) 60**] restart lisinopril today
   -Increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since [**Hospital1 **] is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.2.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
    FEN:
   - residuals improve, so if not extubated may re-start feeding
   - will continue IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - sputum cx/urine cx as above
   - currently on  vancomycin, aztreonam, gentamycin, levofloxacin Day [**2-11**]
   - would like to peel off an antibiotic given that now growing e. coli
   in the urine and in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] wait on speciation until this
   evening
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation
   - currently now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only
   - patient may not have gag reflex at baseline
   - ABG now and change vent settings accordingly
   - Suction PRN
   -Reposition patient
   -off sedation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - [**Month (only) 60**] restart lisinopril today
   -Increase metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since [**Hospital1 **] is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.2.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO ordered, not yet completed
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
    FEN:
   - residuals improve, so if not extubated may re-start feeding
   - will continue IV maintenance fluids at 100 cc/ hr of normal saline as
   patient not eating
   - patient with evidence of stool in distal [**Last Name (LF) 800**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] give her fleets
   enema today, hope that that will improve residuals and allow for tube
   feedings
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   -Monitor K closely, add kayexelate if needed.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and pneumonia, who presents from rehab with septic physiology and respiratory failure. She has a dense paralysis on the right side and is unable to carry on a conversation. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli and pneumonia, with bibasilar consolidations on CXR. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and gentamicin, and has been monitored for septic shock, hypertension, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and cardiac changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's septic physiology and UTI with E. coli increase the risk of sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and tachypnea increase the risk of respiratory arrest and death.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia and normocytic normochromic hematology profile suggest chronic disease or infection, which can worsen her condition.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF and creatinine levels of 2.0 on admission and 1.2 today suggest prerenal etiology secondary to volume depletion and septic shock, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and death.
5. Cardiac changes: The patient's EKG changes, including ST depressions and upward trending CE, suggest demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, which can lead to myocardial infarction and death.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia and difficulty assessing mental status increase the risk of complications, such as falls, aspiration, and infections.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, including coffee ground emesis and guaiac-positive stool, suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
8. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobilization and medical condition increase the risk of VTE, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
9. Infection: The patient's UTI and pneumonia increase the risk of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), which can lead to sepsis and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor for septic shock and sepsis.
2. Monitor respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
3. Monitor anemia and normocytic normochromic hematology profile and consider transfusions if necessary.
4. Monitor ARF and adjust fluid and electrolyte management as needed.
5. Monitor cardiac changes and consider echo and troponin levels.
6. Monitor dementia and consider holding Namenda and Aricept until further assessment.
7. Monitor gastrointestinal symptoms and consider fleets enema and tube feedings if necessary.
8. Monitor for VTE and consider prophylaxis.
9. Monitor for infections and consider adjusting antibiotics and prophylaxis as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with admission with pneumonia and sepsis complicated by
   acute respiratory failure.  She now has difficulty with wean of
   ventilator support largely driven by the increase in secretions this
   morning.  In addition the marked changes in hemodynamics at the time of
   decrease in sedation may be related to anxiety/background HTN but more
   likely and more important would be evidence that patient is not ready
   to accept extubation successfully.
   Sepsis
She has multiple organisms identified and it may well be primary
   pulmonary insult with sepsis as result and aspiration pneumonia is
   perhaps most likely.

   Acute Respiratory Failure
Hypoxemic respiratory failure.  She has
   improved hemodynamics at this time.  She, however, has continued
   significant secretions and limited mental status to allow safe attempt
   at extubation
   -Continue with pneumonia Rx
   -PSV at 15/5
   -Will continue with PEEP increase if hypoxemia continuting.
   Hypertension-
   -Hydralazine and will up titrate B-blocker as stability of hemodynamics
   around extubation is essential.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis, complicated by acute respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation for an unknown duration and has been receiving antibiotics, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Gentamicin, and Aztreonam. She has been experiencing difficulty with weaning from the ventilator due to increased pulmonary secretions and has had changes in hemodynamics during the weaning process. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 153/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory support includes a CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, with a set tidal volume of 420 mL and a spontaneous tidal volume of 354 mL. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of secretions, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
3. Pneumonia-related complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to complications such as pleural effusion, empyema, or lung abscess.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to complications such as cardiac failure, cerebral hemorrhage, or retinopathy.
5. Dementia-related complications: The patient's dementia may lead to complications such as falls, aspiration, or medication errors.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's tube feeding may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate her underlying conditions.
7. Glycemic control issues: The patient's diabetes may lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which can worsen her underlying conditions.
8. Line-related complications: The patient's lines, including the arterial line and multi-lumen line, may lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or line occlusion.
9. Stress ulcer-related complications: The patient's stress ulcer may lead to complications such as bleeding, perforation, or stricture.
10. VAP-related complications: The patient's VAP may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or death."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in blood and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Nothing has grown in
   the sputum culture. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient
   received fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then
   trended down yesterday.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, nothing speciated out yet
   - currently on  aztreonam, gentamycin Day [**2-11**], yesterday vanco and levo
   were d/c
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation and now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 20/5 with 40% O2; however is very
   tachypneic. O2 sats in monitor are ok. [**Month (only) 60**] not be able to extubate in
   AM and require gas. Still requiring pressure support. Presence of gag
   reflex is unknown at baseline. Mental status is non-responsive. Patient
   without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - would like to add back gram + coverage as was d/c yesterday given
   flora findings above
   - + gag reflex
   - increased secretions, likely not candidate for extubation today
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation
   - consider restarting lisinopril once acute renal failure improves
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 [**Hospital1 **]), as per notes was suppose to be
   done yesterday but was not, decreased holding parameters to HR < 60 and
   SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. She has E. coli in her blood and urine, and her sputum culture has grown oropharyngeal flora with 3+ gram-positive cocci in pairs. She has been treated with aztreonam and gentamycin, and her blood pressure has been controlled. She is currently on CPAP with 40% oxygen and is tachypneic. Her mental status is non-responsive, and she has gag reflex absent. She has anemia, acute renal failure, and EKG changes consistent with demand ischemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic physiology and E. coli in her blood and urine put her at risk for septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and need for CPAP with 40% oxygen indicate respiratory failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been controlled, but she is at risk for hypertension due to her medical history and the use of vasopressors.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease or infection, and she may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, but she may still be at risk for acute renal failure due to her medical history and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. EKG changes: The patient's EKG changes consistent with demand ischemia may indicate cardiac dysfunction, and she may require further evaluation and treatment.
7. Dementia: The patient's mental status is non-responsive, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for dementia.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stool and coffee ground emesis from her NG tube indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
9. VAP: The patient's presence of gag reflex absent and her need for CPAP with 40% oxygen put her at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. DVT: The patient's presence of central lines and her medical history put her at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adding gram-positive coverage to the patient's antibiotic regimen based on the results of the sputum culture.
3. Continue to provide CPAP with 40% oxygen to support the patient's respiratory function.
4. Consider extubation once the patient's gag reflex is present and she is able to protect her airway.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider restarting ACEI once the patient's creatinine levels have stabilized.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation and treatment for dementia.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in blood and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Sputum culture with
   gram + cocci. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient received
   fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended
   down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, nothing speciated out yet
   - currently on  aztreonam, gentamycin Day [**2-11**], yesterday vanco and levo
   were d/c, spiked fever to 101
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation and now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 8/5 with 40% O2; with thick secretions. O2
   sats in monitor are ok. + Gag reflex. Mental status is non-responsive.
   Patient without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - start vanco back up, get ID approval
   - will decrease pressure support to [**4-9**] and wean sedation, consider
   trial of extubation today
   - would like to add back gram + coverage as was d/c yesterday given
   flora findings above
   - + gag reflex
   - increased secretions, likely not candidate for extubation today
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and
   titrate up beta blocker
   - consider restarting lisinopril once acute renal failure improves,
   home dose 2.5 ( would rather titrate up beta blocker at this time)
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 [**Hospital1 **]), as per notes was suppose to be
   done yesterday but was not, decreased holding parameters to HR < 60 and
   SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen
   Access: RIJ
   Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**]
   Code: currently full code, as initial DNR was reversed by HCP. [**Name (NI) **]
   need to re-establish if patient would be re-intubated pending failure
   of extubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS now with E coli in blood and
   urine. CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well. Sputum culture with
   gram + cocci. There is some mild enteritis as well. Patient received
   fluid resucitation; here presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended
   down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, nothing speciated out yet
   - currently on  aztreonam, gentamycin Day [**2-11**], yesterday vanco and levo
   were d/c, spiked fever to 101
   - currently off all pressors, off sedation and now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 8/5 with 40% O2; with thick secretions. O2
   sats in monitor are ok. + Gag reflex. Mental status is non-responsive.
   Patient without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - start vanco back up, get ID approval
   - will decrease pressure support to [**4-9**] and wean sedation, consider
   trial of extubation today
   - would like to add back gram + coverage as was d/c yesterday given
   flora findings above
   - + gag reflex
   - increased secretions, likely not candidate for extubation today
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting now of hypertension to 200 may be in
   the setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and
   titrate up beta blocker
   - consider restarting lisinopril once acute renal failure improves,
   home dose 2.5 ( would rather titrate up beta blocker at this time)
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 [**Hospital1 **]), as per notes was suppose to be
   done yesterday but was not, decreased holding parameters to HR < 60 and
   SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
    -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
    EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - recheck EKG now that tachycardia has improved
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen
   Access: RIJ
   Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**]
   Code: currently full code, as initial DNR was reversed by HCP. [**Name (NI) **]

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who presents from rehab with pneumonia and septic physiology. She has E. coli in her blood and urine and is currently on antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she has mild enteritis and a WBC count of 17.0. She has a chest x-ray showing bibasilar consolidations and is on CPAP/PSV with 40% O2. She has thick secretions and a gag reflex, but is not a candidate for extubation today. She has hypertension, anemia, ARF, and EKG changes, and is being treated accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology is being treated with antibiotics, but she is still at risk for further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being treated with CPAP/PSV, but she may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if her condition deteriorates.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being treated with antihypertensives, but she may require further management if her blood pressure remains elevated.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being treated with iron supplements, but she may require further management if her hematocrit remains low.
5. ARF: The patient's ARF is being treated with fluids and electrolytes, but she may require further management if her creatinine level remains elevated.
6. EKG Changes: The patient's EKG changes are being monitored, but she may require further evaluation if her cardiac function remains abnormal.
7. Dementia: The patient's dementia is being treated with medications, but she may require further management if her mental status deteriorates.
8. FEN: The patient's FEN is being treated with tube feedings, but she may require further management if her nutritional status remains poor.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, but she may require further management if she develops any of these complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to ensure that her septic physiology is being effectively treated.
2. Consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory failure worsens.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension, anemia, ARF, and EKG changes as necessary.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's dementia and FEN if her mental status or nutritional status deteriorates.
5. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with hypoxemic respiratory failure and now with imroved
   oxygenation and ventilation but with continued barriers to extubation
   primarily driven by persistent secretions and low grade fever.  This,
   it must be noted, is in the setting of rising WBC count.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient with Rx ongoing for probable pulmonary infection.
   -She has had return of gag reflex
   -Her sputum volume had decreased to suctioning every 4 hours by nursing
   with perhaps some additional by respiratory
   -She has maintained reasonable support with PSV at 8/5 with Ve
   requirement of 10 lpm
   -Given fever and WBC increased to 17 will maintain Vanco/Gent
   -Goal is to D/C sedation and trial extubation today
   2)Sepsis-
   -E.Coli seen in urine and blood
   -Sputum not revealing
   -Hemodynamics improved
   -Low grade fevers and rising WBC count are of concern and will maintain
   broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Vanco/Gent to continue
   3)Dementia-
   -Patient described as verbal with one word answers at baseline
   -Will hope to see further improvement with discontinuation of sedating
   medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with hypoxemic respiratory failure and now with imroved
   oxygenation and ventilation but with continued barriers to extubation
   primarily driven by persistent secretions and low grade fever.  This,
   it must be noted, is in the setting of rising WBC count.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient with Rx ongoing for probable pulmonary infection.
   -She has had return of gag reflex
   -Her sputum volume had decreased to suctioning every 4 hours by nursing
   with perhaps some additional by respiratory
   -She has maintained reasonable support with PSV at 8/5 with Ve
   requirement of 10 lpm
   -Given fever and WBC increased to 17 will maintain Vanco/Gent
   -Goal is to D/C sedation and trial extubation today
   2)Sepsis-
   -E.Coli seen in urine and blood
   -Sputum not revealing
   -Hemodynamics improved
   -Low grade fevers and rising WBC count are of concern and will maintain
   broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Vanco/Gent to continue
   3)Dementia-
   -Patient described as verbal with one word answers at baseline
   -Will hope to see further improvement with discontinuation of sedating
   medications.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, sepsis, and dementia. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and has shown some improvement in oxygenation and ventilation. However, there are still barriers to extubation, primarily driven by persistent secretions and low-grade fever.

The patient's laboratory results show a rising white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient has been diagnosed with probable pulmonary infection and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, but the low-grade fever and rising WBC count are of concern.

The patient's medical history is significant for dementia, and the patient's neurological examination is abnormal, with no response to verbal commands, no movement, and no tone.

The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator with a pressure support of 8 cmH2O, a peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas results show a pH of 7.38, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 33 mmHg, and a partial pressure of oxygen of 106 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance is significant, with a total input of 2,326 mL and a total output of 2,193 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 133 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,158 mL, and the patient's stool output is 238 mL.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, hydralazine, and aztreonam. The patient's nutritional status is compromised, with a nutrition plan of npo.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Sepsis-induced cardiac arrest
3. Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
4. Infection progression and septic shock
5. Neurological deterioration due to inadequate sedation and pain management
6. Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance
7. Nutritional deficiencies and compromised immune function

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci. There is some mild
   enteritis as wel as CTl. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended
   down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 8/5 with 40% O2; with thick secretions. O2
   sats in monitor are ok. + Gag reflex. Mental status is non-responsive.
   Patient without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - start vanco back up
   - will decrease pressure support to [**4-9**] and wean sedation, consider
   trial of extubation today
   - + gag reflex, still with thick yellow secretions
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen
   Access: RIJ

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci. There is some mild
   enteritis as wel as CTl. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended
   down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due to
   pneumonia. Patient on CPAP 8/5 with 40% O2; with thick secretions. O2
   sats in monitor are ok. + Gag reflex. Mental status is non-responsive.
   Patient without much secretions.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - start vanco back up
   - will decrease pressure support to [**4-9**] and wean sedation, consider
   trial of extubation today
   - + gag reflex, still with thick yellow secretions
   - Suction PRN
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with upward trending CE. This is likely demand
   ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and tachycardia under
   control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
   Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - holding namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, restarted tube feedings, holding this AM in the
   setting of considering extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen
   Access: RIJ
   Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**]
   Code: currently full code, as initial DNR was reversed by HCP. [**Name (NI) **]
   need to re-establish if patient would be re-intubated pending failure
   of extubation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 142/62 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.8 x 10^9/L, with a differential count of 90.0% neutrophils, 5.0% bands, 3.0% lymphocytes, and 2.0% monocytes. The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and her lactate level is 2.6 mmol/L.

The patient's radiology results show bibasilar consolidations on chest X-ray, consistent with pneumonia.

The patient's medical conditions include septic shock, respiratory failure, hypertension, anemia, acute renal failure, and dementia.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, gentamicin, fentanyl, midazolam, hydralazine, heparin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and namenda.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, and it is essential to continue monitoring her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting her medications as needed.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease or infection, and it is essential to continue monitoring her hematocrit and iron profile.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to volume depletion and septic shock, and it is essential to continue monitoring her creatinine level and adjusting her medications as needed.
6. Dementia: The patient's dementia is a concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring her mental status and adjusting her medications as needed.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. It is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs and laboratory results closely and adjusting her medications and treatments as needed to ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.
   Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - vanc day 2, gentamicin day [**3-13**].
   - Suction PRN
   - will hold on extubation this morning despite excellent vent settings
   secondary to copious secretions
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, re-start tube feedings in the setting of holding
   off on extubation today
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.
   Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - vanc day 2, gentamicin day [**3-13**].
   - Suction PRN
   - will hold on extubation this morning despite excellent vent settings
   secondary to copious secretions
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, re-start tube feedings in the setting of holding
   off on extubation today
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary
   secretions.  Mental status has been impaired but it is likely near her
   baseline function.  There were extensive discussions with the patient's
   sister and daughter to clarify current clinical course.  They would
   endorse full code status and re-intubation if patient were to fail
   trial of extubation.
   With that clarified patient has had good tolerance of PSV and retains
   altered mental status and pulmonary secretions as the primary barriers
   to extubation.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Has good tolerance of PSV wean but persistent and
   signficiant secreations remain at issue.  She has had improved
   responsiveness.  With suctioning there are fairly high volume of
   secreations noted and suctioning has been every 1-2 hours.  This in
   combination with impaired gag reflex does raise concerns for successful
   extubation.
   -Continue with PSV today
   -Continue with Vanco/Gent
   -Will wake up and re-trial SBT in am
   2)Sepsis-
   -Check C. Diff
   -Check differential
   -Reculture if fever seen
   -This leukocytsis will have to be explained but does not appear to be
   recurrence of sepsis at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary secretions. She has been intubated and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 0.4 and has normalized arterial blood gases (ABG).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 67 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 165/67 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin individual with normal head, ears, nose, and throat examination, distant heart sounds, and symmetric chest expansion with resonant percussion. Her abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, and her extremities show trace edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 84 x 10^9/L, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. Her lactate level is 2.6 mmol/L, and her albumin level is 2.2 g/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing respiratory failure with persistent pulmonary secretions, which are the primary barriers to extubation. She has good tolerance of PSV, but her impaired mental status and pulmonary secretions require continued support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: Continued secretion production and impaired gag reflex may lead to unsuccessful extubation and potential respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may indicate ongoing sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent pulmonary secretions may indicate pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and increased risk of complications.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases her risk of developing VAP, which could lead to further respiratory failure and increased risk of complications.
5. Stress ulceration: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids may increase her risk of stress ulceration, which could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and further complications.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness increase her risk of developing DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and further complications.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary secretions, which require ongoing mechanical ventilation and close monitoring. Her condition is complex, and potential medical complications can arise from her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.
   Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pnemonia
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - attempt extubation this morning as almost no pressure support
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, will titrate up today to 5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - tube feedings overnight, hold this AM for extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - attempt extubation this morning as almost no pressure support
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, will titrate up today to 5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presented to the ICU with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. She was intubated and received invasive ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on pressure support with 40% O2 and has thick secretions. She has a gag reflex, but her mental status is difficult to assess due to intubation.
* Cardiovascular: She has hypertension, which was initially managed with IV hydralazine, but is now being titrated up with beta blockers. She has anemia, with a hematocrit drop, and is likely experiencing prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to volume depletion and septic shock.
* Neurological: Her mental status is difficult to assess due to intubation, but she is responding to verbal stimuli.
* Infection: She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia, with a sputum culture growing gram-positive cocci. She is being treated with gentamicin and vancomycin.
* Gastrointestinal: She has had no bowel movements since admission, and her stool guaiac test is positive. She is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal: Her creatinine has improved from 2.0 to 0.7, and she is likely experiencing ATN. Her eGFR is 46, which may allow for the restart of ACEI.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is high due to her positive stool guaiac test and lack of bowel movements.
* Renal failure: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology may lead to further organ dysfunction or death.

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing her respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal status, as well as her infection and renal function. Close monitoring and frequent reassessment are necessary to address any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.
   Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.
   - repeat sputum culture wtih 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs and
   chains, with 2+ oropharyngeal flora, speciation partial only with oral
   flora currently
   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**3-13**], yesterday restrated vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data from sputum thus far has grown orophyaryngeal flora only,
   now with 3+ gram positive cocci in pairs, awaiting speciation
   - vanc day 2, gentamicin day [**3-13**].
   - Suction PRN
   - will hold on extubation this morning despite excellent vent settings
   secondary to copious secretions
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - will restart lisinopril today now that acute renal failure has
   resolved, home dose 2.5
   -Increase metoprolol today (to 50 TID),  holding parameters to HR < 60
   and SBP < 100
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 1.0.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept for now
   FEN:
   - residuals improve, re-start tube feedings in the setting of holding
   off on extubation today
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis physiology.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation. Her urine culture shows Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Providencia stuartii, both of which are sensitive to various antibiotics. However, the patient has received antibiotics, including aztreonam, vancomycin, and gentamicin, which may have contributed to the development of sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 17.0-22.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8-9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 91-133 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16-26.8 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140-144 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.7-4.1 mEq/L
* Calcium: 7.6-8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7-2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.0-2.5 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her intubation, but her skin is noted to be warm and dry, and her neurologic examination is incomplete.

The patient's medical history includes breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, which may have contributed to her current condition. Her recent laboratory results show elevated WBC count, which may indicate an infection. The patient's kidney function is slightly impaired, and her electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis physiology and positive urine culture suggest a high risk of sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
3. UTI: The patient's UTI may persist or worsen, leading to kidney damage and increased risk of sepsis.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's slightly impaired kidney function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
6. CVA: The patient's recent CVA may have contributed to her current condition, and further complications, such as hemorrhage or edema, may arise.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination. The patient's antibiotics should be continued, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and corrected as necessary. The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for dialysis if necessary."

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia, given sensitivities above will change
   to amikacin and keep vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions, however looks like working harder to breath with tachypnea.
   + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep suctioning this
   morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - will go up on pressure support today to 10 or 12 to improve breathing
   - continue sedation for now
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - restart tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine.
   CXR shows bibasilar consolidations as well concerning for possible
   pneumonia. Sputum culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown
   out so far in speciation. There is some mild enteritis as wel as CTl.

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia, given sensitivities above will change
   to amikacin and keep vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions, however looks like working harder to breath with tachypnea.
   + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep suctioning this
   morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - will go up on pressure support today to 10 or 12 to improve breathing
   - continue sedation for now
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - restart tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pneumonia, given sensitivities above will change
   to amikacin and keep vancomycin
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions, however looks like working harder to breath with tachypnea.
   + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep suctioning this
   morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - will go up on pressure support today to 10 or 12 to improve breathing
   - continue sedation for now
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - restart tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 82 year old female with h/o breast cancer, cva, htn
   who presented from rehab with pneumonia, uti with sepsis physiology.

 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2192-8-22**] 09:00 AM
 URINE CULTURE - At [**2192-8-23**] 12:23 AM
   -Yesterday per nursing thought that patient not be ready for extubation
   with lots of secretions.
   - restarted namenda and aricept
   - low potassium yesterday morning, got repletion with IV sliding scale
   - fingersticks was 37 yesterday morning, then subsequently 61 (got [**12-7**]
   amp d50) - which was not written for by M.D.
   - tube feeds were not re-started yesterday morning, even though it was
   decided on rounds to restart b/c did not extubate patient
   - spoke with evening nurse, restarted tube feeds, sent stool for c.
   diff (nurse [**First Name (Titles) 5426**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5427**] like c. diff) so placed patient on
   precautions
   - repeat ca and phos low, repleted, still low
   - repeat UA still with large LE, WBCs, RBcs, urine cx pending
   - got repleted but phos didn't change, off Versed overnight, had to go
   back on fentanyl, d/c fentayl drip 5 am will bolus as needed with goal

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presented to the ICU with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. She was intubated and received antibiotics, including gentamicin, vancomycin, and amikacin. Her condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, hypertension, anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and possible cardiac ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, with a need for pressure support and suctioning. There is a risk of further deterioration or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and there is a risk of further hypertension-related complications, such as cardiac ischemia or cerebral hemorrhage.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease or infection, and there is a risk of further blood loss or transfusion-related complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has improved, but there is still a risk of further kidney damage or progression to chronic kidney disease.
5. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's EKG changes suggest possible demand ischemia, and there is a risk of further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology is still present, and there is a risk of further sepsis-related complications, such as organ failure or death.
7. C. difficile Infection: The patient's stool culture is pending, but there is a risk of further C. difficile-related complications, such as diarrhea, colitis, or sepsis.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is still present, and there is a risk of further complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
9. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection is still present, and there is a risk of further complications, such as sepsis or kidney damage.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications and monitor for further complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions as needed to prevent further blood loss.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further kidney damage.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further cardiac testing, such as an echocardiogram, to assess cardiac function.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's septic physiology and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further sepsis-related complications.
7. Consider further testing, such as a C. difficile toxin assay, to confirm the diagnosis of C. difficile infection.
8. Consider further testing, such as a chest CT scan, to assess the severity of the patient's pneumonia.
9. Consider further testing, such as a urine culture, to assess the severity of the patient's urinary tract infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - currently on  gentamycin Day [**4-12**] to cover for urosepsis as well as
   possible healthcare associated pneumonia, vancomycin for possible
   healthcare associated pnemonia
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   -monitor WBC, CBC, diff
   - wbc count continuese to trend up
 will send repeat ua and urine
   culture as well as stool culture and c. diff and follow-up
   -monitor fever curve- patient initially febrile but became hypothermic
   requiring bear hugger, now normothermic
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure thought to be due
   to pneumonia. Patient on pressure support [**4-9**] with 40% O2; with thick
   secretions. + Gag reflex prior although not too much with deep
   suctioning this morning. Patient squeezing hands this morning.
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - attempt extubation this morning as almost no pressure support
   - will shut off sedation and see if mental status improves, stronger
   cough and stronger gag prior to extubation
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension
   - gave 10 IV hydral in the setting of hypertension to 200 may be in the
   setting of agitation, would like to get away from IV hydral and titrate
   up beta blocker as tolerated
   - lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, will titrate up today to 5 mg daily
   -metoprolol 50 mg TID, consider furthur uptitration as tolerated
   post-extubation
    Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, have not sent stool studies as
   patient has had no stool, however suspect positive
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   to 0.7.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion and
   septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not fresh.
   Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - trend creatinine
   -Maintain adequate BP and hydration
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This is
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. Now that BP and
   tachycardia under control, warm and perfusing, can follow-up cardiac
   function with echo.
   - repeat EKG from [**8-20**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular
   contractions. Poor R wave progression may be lead placement or possible
   old anterior myocardial infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.
   - ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
   Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
   Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
   - troponins slighlty increased, but in settig of sepsis may represent
   myocardial stunning, also echo is reassuming that there is no regional
   wall motion abnormalities
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - restart namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - tube feedings overnight, hold this AM for extubation
   -Monitor and replete electrolytes as needed.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presented from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. The patient was intubated and received antibiotics, including gentamicin and vancomycin, for suspected healthcare-associated pneumonia and urosepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on pressure support with 40% O2 and has thick secretions. She has a gag reflex, but it is not strong. The plan is to attempt extubation this morning.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with lisinopril and metoprolol. Her creatinine level has improved from 2.0 to 0.7, and she may be able to restart ACEI.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 0.7. She is at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) or infection.
* Electrolyte status: The patient has low potassium and phosphorus levels, which are being repleted.
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia, which is likely due to chronic disease or infection. Her iron profile suggests chronic disease or infection.
* Infectious status: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia, and is being treated with antibiotics. She also has a suspicion of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require continued respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and AKI may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
* Renal complications: The patient's AKI may progress to CKD or chronic renal failure.
* Infectious complications: The patient's UTI and pneumonia may not respond to antibiotics, and she may develop sepsis or septic shock.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's anemia and iron profile suggest chronic disease or infection, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or obstruction.
* Neurological complications: The patient's dementia and anemia may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

The patient's plan of care should include:

* Continued respiratory support and monitoring of her respiratory status.
* Management of her hypertension and AKI with ACEI and other medications.
* Repletion of electrolytes, including potassium and phosphorus.
* Monitoring of her hematological status and anemia.
* Continued treatment of her UTI and pneumonia with antibiotics.
* Monitoring of her infectious status and suspicion of C. diff infection.
* Consideration of gastrointestinal and neurological complications and appropriate management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, is admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. She has improved, with the ventilator weaned down, and is having increased secretions. She is off versed overnight and experiencing diarrhea. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli and Providencia, and is receiving IV antibiotics. She has a history of hypertension, anemia, and acute renal failure (ARF), which has improved. The patient is critically ill and is being treated with diuretics to manage fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's respiratory failure and prolonged use of the ventilator, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or cardiovascular instability.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated glucose levels and presence of diabetes may increase the risk of DKA.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient's diarrhea may be related to C. difficile infection, which can lead to colitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of hypertension and recent immobility may increase the risk of PE.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's tachypnea, poor cough, and respiratory failure may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
7. Worsening anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding, hemolysis, or bone marrow suppression.
8. Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen due to ongoing sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, or inadequate fluid management.
9. Infection-related complications: The patient's UTI and presence of Providencia may lead to infection-related complications, such as septic shock or meningitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
2. Maintain close monitoring of the patient's fluid status and adjust diuretic therapy accordingly.
3. Continue antibiotics for the UTI and consider adding coverage for C. difficile.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
5. Consider ordering a stat troponin to rule out cardiac injury.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing red blood cells if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy accordingly.
8. Consider ordering a stat CT scan to rule out PE or other complications.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 82-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, admitted with urosepsis and respiratory failure. She has improved, with her ventilator weaned down, and is experiencing increased secretions. She has diarrhea and is receiving antibiotics, including aztreonam, gentamicin, and vancomycin. The patient has a history of hypertension, anemia, and acute renal failure, which has improved. She is also receiving diuretics and has a code status of full code.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with tachypnea and poor cough, making extubation challenging. Pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary edema are potential complications.
2. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's fluid overload may lead to worsening pulmonary edema, which can further compromise respiratory function.
3. **UTI:** The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli and Providencia, which may not be fully treated with current antibiotics. Resistance to antibiotics is a concern, and the patient may require further treatment adjustments.
4. **Diarrhea:** The patient's diarrhea may be a sign of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, which can worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
5. **Hypertension:** The patient's hypertension may not be adequately controlled, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac failure or stroke.
6. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may not be fully treated, potentially leading to further complications, such as cardiovascular instability or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. **Acute Renal Failure:** Although the patient's acute renal failure has improved, it is essential to monitor her renal function closely to prevent further deterioration.
8. **VAP:** The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.
9. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's diarrhea and increased secretions may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. **Sepsis:** The patient's sepsis may not be fully resolved, and further complications, such as organ dysfunction or failure, can arise if not adequately managed.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing, which may worsen respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, but it may decrease if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock, and the current antibiotic regimen may not be adequate to treat the underlying infection. The patient's white blood cell count continues to trend up with bandemia, which may indicate ongoing sepsis.
3. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypertensive, and the antihypertensive regimen needs to be adjusted to control blood pressure. The patient's creatinine level has improved, but the patient may still be at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) due to septic shock and hypotension.
4. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic normochromic anemia, which may be due to chronic disease or infection. The patient's guaiac stool test is positive, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding, which needs to be investigated further.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has improved, but the patient may still be at risk for AKI due to septic shock, hypotension, and hypovolemia.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored due to the use of diuretics, antibiotics, and other medications.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's EKG changes suggest demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
8. Dementia: The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to intubation, and the patient's dementia may worsen if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
9. Infection: The patient has a history of urinary tract infection and pneumonia, and the patient may still be at risk for secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. Malnutrition: The patient's tube feeds may not be adequate to meet the patient's nutritional needs, and the patient may require additional nutritional support.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the ventilator settings as needed.
2. Review the patient's antibiotic regimen and adjust it as necessary to ensure adequate coverage of the underlying infection.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust the antihypertensive regimen as necessary to control blood pressure.
4. Investigate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust the patient's anticoagulation regimen as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
6. Consider performing a colonoscopy to investigate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust the patient's sedation regimen as necessary to prevent delirium.
9. Review the patient's infection control measures and adjust them as necessary to prevent secondary infections.
10. Consider performing a nutritional assessment to determine the patient's nutritional needs and adjust the patient's nutrition regimen accordingly."

   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
    Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine,
   as well as providencia stuartii in urine. CXR shows bibasilar
   consolidations as well concerning for possible pneumonia. Sputum
   culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown out so far in
   speciation. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.  Repeat
   urine culture now negative.
   - repeat sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-20**]): >25 PMNs and <10
   epithelial cells/100X field. 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM
   POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
   2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH
   OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-22**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL
   FLORA.
   - urine culture 9./17
 no growth final
   - c. diff negative [**8-22**]
   - Urine -urine cx - URINE CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-20**]):
   ESCHERICHIA COLI.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   PROVIDENCIA STUARTII.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   - currently on  amikacin and vancomycin, still with tachypneia,
   although secretions have improved
   - allergy to PCN
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   - wbc count continuese to trend up with bandemia
 repeat Ucx is clean,
   c diff negative, may suggest that pneumonia is not being adequately
   treated, however patient remains afebrile
   - chest x-ray from yesterday
   1) No significant change since [**2192-8-21**] with right pleural
   effusion
   and basilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
   2) Unchanged support lines and tubes.
   -continue to monitor fever curve, WBC
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia. Suspect that also be aspect of deconditioning. Patient on
   pressure support [**11-9**] with 40% O2; with improved secretions, hoever
   patient remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing, patient
   with  present but impaired gag reflex. Rsbi this morning 85.
   - trial of pressure support 8/0 then check after 30 minutes then
   consider vent liberation
   -  iv lasx 20 daily as patient net > 10 liters positive, may be
   impairing ability to get off vent
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
   - consider again increasing pressure support
   - off sedation
   Mental status
   - decreased mental status even when off the sedating medications, will
   check head CT to ensure that hasn
t had new ischemic event
   Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension,
   now restarted
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril today to 5
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID this morning
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
     Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   baseline.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion
   and septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not
   fresh. Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   - continue to follow
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This was
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. repeat EKG from [**8-20**]
   EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular contractions. Poor R wave
   progression may be lead placement or possible old anterior myocardial
   infarction. Compared to
   the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has shifted rightward. Ventricular
   ectopy is new.  ECHO from [**8-20**] - IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic
   dysfunction. Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic
   regurgitation. Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
    Dementia:  Currently intubated to difficult to assess mental status.
   - namenda and aricept yesterday
   FEN:
   - tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
   Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension who was admitted to the ICU from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. She has been treated with amikacin and vancomycin, and her secretions have improved, but she remains tachypneic and has not yet been weaned off the ventilator. Her mental status has decreased, and she is currently intubated. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin levels, indicating ongoing sepsis. She has also developed hypertension, which is being managed with antihypertensive medications. Her creatinine level has improved, but she remains at risk for acute kidney injury. Her EKG shows ST depressions and ventricular ectopy, which may be related to her septic shock and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's continued tachypnea and work of breathing may indicate ongoing respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition if not addressed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis, as indicated by her elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin levels, may continue to worsen her condition if not effectively managed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level has improved, but she remains at risk for acute kidney injury due to her ongoing sepsis and hypotension.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may continue to worsen if not effectively managed with antihypertensive medications.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's decreased mental status may continue to worsen if not addressed, which could impact her overall prognosis.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's EKG changes, including ST depressions and ventricular ectopy, may indicate ongoing cardiovascular complications, which could worsen her condition if not addressed.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's tube feeds may not be providing adequate nutrition, which could worsen her overall condition if not addressed.
8. Infection: The patient's ongoing sepsis and urinary tract infection may continue to worsen her condition if not effectively managed with antibiotics and other treatments."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving treatment for her conditions.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 170/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 7 mmHg

The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and is on pressure support with 40% oxygen. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, including gentamicin and vancomycin, to cover for urosepsis and possible healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a hematocrit drop, and is being treated with iron supplements. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL on admission, but has improved to 0.7 mg/dL today.

The patient has a history of cardiac disease, with ST depressions on EKG and negative troponins, but is currently being treated with beta blockers and is being monitored for cardiac function.

The patient has a history of dementia and is being treated with namenda and aricept. The patient is also receiving tube feeds and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and the patient may require further respiratory support.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic physiology is still present, and the patient may require further treatment to control the infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is still present, and the patient may require further treatment with iron supplements or blood transfusions.
4. Cardiac disease: The patient's cardiac disease is still present, and the patient may require further treatment with beta blockers or other medications to control the condition.
5. Dementia: The patient's dementia is still present, and the patient may require further treatment with medications or other interventions to manage the condition.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is still uncertain, and the patient may require further treatment with tube feeds or other interventions to ensure adequate nutrition.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances are still present, and the patient may require further treatment with medications or other interventions to manage the condition.
8. Infections: The patient's infections are still present, and the patient may require further treatment with antibiotics or other medications to control the infections.

In summary, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving treatment for her conditions. The patient has a history of anemia, cardiac disease, dementia, and nutritional deficiencies, and is at risk for further complications, including respiratory failure, septic shock, anemia, cardiac disease, dementia, nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with respiratory failure, intubated for 24 hours, and has persistent altered mental status with decreased responsiveness. She has decreased secretions and has tolerated diuresis well without hemodynamic compromise. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 144/54 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the team is considering a trial of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 30 minutes to evaluate her readiness for extubation. If the SBT is unsuccessful, tracheostomy may be necessary.
2. ID-Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of ID-pneumonia, and she is receiving antibiotics. However, the team should continue to monitor her for signs of worsening pneumonia, such as increased secretions, fever, or decreased oxygen saturation.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is a concern, and the team should continue to monitor her for signs of worsening encephalopathy. A head CT scan is planned to evaluate for any structural abnormalities.
4. Diuresis: The patient has tolerated diuresis well, but the team should continue to monitor her for signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
5. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the team should continue to monitor her for signs of infection, such as increased secretions, fever, or decreased oxygen saturation.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her prolonged immobility, and the team should continue to monitor her for signs of DVT, such as swelling or pain in the legs.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her prolonged immobility and critical illness, and the team should continue to monitor her for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   who presents from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and
   septic physiology.
   Septic Shock:  Patient was with SIRS with E coli in blood and urine, as
   well as providencia stuartii in urine. CXR shows bibasilar
   consolidations as well concerning for possible pneumonia. Sputum
   culture with gram + cocci however this has not grown out so far in
   speciation. Presentation lactate was 3.4, then trended down.  Repeat
   urine culture now negative.
   - repeat sputum culture - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-20**]): >25 PMNs and <10
   epithelial cells/100X field. 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM
   POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND CHAINS.
   2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   MULTIPLE ORGANISMS CONSISTENT WITH
   OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-22**]): SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL
   FLORA.
   - vanc trough 20.7 this AM so she is definitely therapeutic on vanc
   - urine culture 9./17
 no growth final
   - c. diff negative [**8-22**]
   - Urine -urine cx - URINE CULTURE (Final [**2192-8-20**]): ESCHERICHIA
   COLI.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. PROVIDENCIA STUARTII.
   10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
   - currently on  amikacin and vancomycin, allergy to PCN (previously on
   levoquin and aztreonam as well)
 levoquin was d/c in the setting of
   gram positive cocci in the sputum after 3 day course and aztreonam was
   d/c as no sensitivities identified to e. coli or providenciaa stuartii
   and aztreonam with poor gram + coverage
   - currently off all pressors, now hypertensive
   - wbc count continuese to trend up with bandemia
 repeat Ucx is clean,
   c diff negative, may suggest that pneumonia is not being adequately
   treated, however patient remains afebrile, also able to be extubated
   yesterday so clinically improved
   - chest x-ray [**8-24**] - PFI: New right round perihilar mass concerning for
   possible loculated fluid, abscess, tumor.
   - consider ct of chest for furthur evaluation
    Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia/sepsis. Suspect that also be aspect of deconditioning.
   Patient now off ventilator completely breathing on roomm air.  Given IV
   lasix yesterday had large diuresis
   -  will hold off on additional antibiotics at this time
   -culture data and antibiotics as above
   - Suction PRN
    Mental status
   - patient is now responsive to verbal stimuli, opening her eyes. Will
   squeeze hands in response to her name. moves legs spontaneously.
   Currently not speaking, although as per [**Hospital3 **] at  baseline
   answers with one word
   - may be in the setting of severe illness and previously being on
   sedation that patient has severe dementia at baseline
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension,
   now restarted
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril yesterday to 5, will again increase today to 10
   mg po daily
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID yesterday, will uptitrate to 100 mg TID
   with holding parameters for HR and SBP
   - will hold off on additional lasix today for pressure control
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   baseline.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion
   and septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not
   fresh. Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This was
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. repeat EKG from [**8-20**]
   EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular contractions. Poor R wave
   progression may be lead placement or possible old anterior myocardial
   infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has
   shifted rightward. Ventricular ectopy is new.  ECHO from [**8-20**] -
   IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated right
   ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta.
    Dementia:  patient still with decreased mental status despite being
   off the ventilator.
   - namenda and aricept yesterday
    FEN:
   - tube feeds
   -check pm lytes, replete electrolytes as needed.
    Prophylaxis: SC heparin, holding bowel regimen for diarrhea, ppi
    Access: RIJ, will d/c a-line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of pneumonia and sepsis, which can lead to respiratory failure. The patient was initially on ventilator support, but was successfully extubated yesterday. However, the patient's chest x-ray shows bibasilar consolidations, which may indicate ongoing pneumonia. The patient's respiratory culture shows gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which can lead to septic shock. The patient's lactate level trended down, but the patient remains hypertensive, which may indicate ongoing sepsis.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which can lead to cardiovascular complications. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated overnight, and the patient is currently taking antihypertensives.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. The patient's hematocrit level has dropped, and the patient is currently receiving blood transfusions.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF, which can lead to chronic kidney disease. The patient's creatinine level has improved, but the patient's eGFR is still decreased.
6. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, which can lead to cognitive decline and memory loss. The patient's mental status has improved slightly, but the patient remains responsive only to verbal stimuli.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. The patient's EKG shows ST depressions, which may indicate demand ischemia.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and sepsis. The patient's stool guaiac test is positive, which may indicate ongoing bleeding.
9. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of neurological disease, which can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and spinal cord injury. The patient's neurological status has improved slightly, but the patient remains responsive only to verbal stimuli.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   possible loculated fluid,
   abscess, tumor.
   - with concern for above findings, ordered ct chest and head
   Respiratory Failure: Initially respiratory failure likely due to
   pneumonia. Suspect that also be aspect of deconditioning. Patient on
   pressure support [**11-9**] with 40% O2; with improved secretions, hoever
   patient remains tachypneic with significant work of breathing, patient
   with  present but impaired gag reflex. Rsbi this morning 85.

   - decreased mental status , will check head CT
    Hypertension:
   - initially holding anti-hypertensives in the setting  of hypotension,
   now restarted
   - IV hydral PRN for elevated blood pressure, but trying to get on
   better beta blocker/ace regimen
   - increased lisinopril yesterday to 5, will again increase today
   -increased metoprolol to 75 TID yesterday, will continue to uptitrate
   as tolerated
   - lasix today for blood pressure control as well as fluid removal
   Anemia: Hematocrit drop; normocytic normochromic with iron profile
   sugesting chornic disease or infection. It is not that likely massive
   GI bleed in patient that did not move bowels since blood is prokinetic.
   Will guaiac stool when available.
   - crit is stable
   -Patient guaic positive in the ED, guiac positive stool
   - Coffee ground emesis from NG tube; guaiac negative
   - likely requires outpatient colonscopy, which is non-emergent
   - continue to follow
    ARF: Creatinine 2.0 on admission, from baseline of 0.6 today improved
   baseline.  Likely prerenal in etiology secondary to volume depletion
   and septic shock
 likely ATN. No cast seen in UA, but it was not
   fresh. Today
s eGFR is 46 (MDRD formula) so may restart ACEI.
   EKG Changes:  Patient with ST depressions in the setting of sinus
   tachycardia to the 130s with multiple negative troponins. This was
   likely demand ischemia in setting of hypotension. repeat EKG from [**8-20**]
   EKG Sinus rhythm. Premature ventricular contractions. Poor R wave
   progression may be lead placement or possible old anterior myocardial
   infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2192-8-18**] axis has
   shifted rightward. Ventricular ectopy is new.  ECHO from [**8-20**] -
   IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly dilated right
   ventricle. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderately dilated
   ascending aorta.
    Dementia:  patient still with decreased mental status despite being
   off the ventilator.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension, who presents to the ICU from rehab with pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and septic physiology. She was previously intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday. She has a right hilar mass seen on chest x-ray and is being treated with antibiotics for E. coli and Providencia stuartii in her blood and urine. She has developed hypertension overnight and is being treated with fentanyl for pain. Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic physiology and positive blood cultures for E. coli and Providencia stuartii suggest a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest x-ray shows bibasilar consolidations, which may indicate pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure and tachypnea suggest that pneumonia may not be adequately treated.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension overnight and the need for increased fentanyl suggest that her blood pressure may be difficult to control.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia and normocytic normochromic blood cells may indicate chronic disease or infection.
5. ARF: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.0 to 0.9, but her eGFR is still 46, which may indicate that she is at risk for acute kidney injury.
6. Cardiac Issues: The patient's EKG shows ST depressions, premature ventricular contractions, and poor R wave progression, which may indicate demand ischemia or old anterior myocardial infarction.
7. Dementia: The patient's decreased mental status despite being off the ventilator suggests that she may be at risk for further cognitive decline.
8. GI Issues: The patient's coffee ground emesis and guaiac positive stool suggest that she may have gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition.
9. VAP: The patient's need for suction PRN and her respiratory failure suggest that she may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
10. DVT: The patient's risk factors for DVT, including her age and immobility, suggest that she may be at risk for deep vein thrombosis.

Based on this information, it appears that the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, hypertension, anemia, ARF, cardiac issues, dementia, GI issues, VAP, and DVT. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting her treatment plan as necessary to prevent these complications and improve her overall health."
