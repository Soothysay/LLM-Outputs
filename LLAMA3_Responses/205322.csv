   [**2199-3-13**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
   normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is significant aortic stenosis that is
   probably severe (estimated aortic valve area ~0.8 cm2). No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
   Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. No ventricular thrombus identified.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with diabetes, hyperlipedemia, and hypertension without past
   known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST depression
   consistent with NSTEMI.
   # NSTEMI: TIMI score of 5. The patient has elevated biomarkers. Denies
   past CV disease but EKG suggest prior inferior MI. Echo shows
   significant systolic dysfunction. Will consider cardiac
   catheterization. Continue medical management for now.

   - high dose atorvastatin
   - trend biomarkers
   - cont tele
   - control HTN - beta blocker
   - guaiac stools
   - consider catheterization - patient with significant renal failure and
   respiratory distress
   # Shortness of breath, hypoxia: Continues to require oxygen for
   support. Acute pulmonary edema most likely secondary to AS and
   compromised cardiac function. Lack of effusions suggest acute evolution
   of NSTEMI. Less likely pneumonia although will evaluated with PA/Lat
   CXR today after some diuresis. The patient was started on a lasix gtt
   with poor urine output and a rise in creatinine. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   PE, although currently treating for PE, CT would be dangerous to
   kidneys and V/Q would be difficult due to amount of pulmonary
   involvement on CXR.
   - Cont lasix gtt
   - trend Cr
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   # Acute on chronic kidney disease: The patient has a [**Month (only) 4578**]
   creatinine of 1.2-1.4. Presents at 1.6. Worsened with attempts to
   diurese overnight.
   - trend creatinine
   - was given mucomyst before cath
   - metformin held
   - be careful with diuresis
   - UA and urine lytes
   # Relative hypotension: appears to be mentating well. No evidence of
   hypoperfusion on examination. If worsens would be concerned for
   cardiogenic shock and would need additional therapy including possible
   pressor support.
   # Hyperkalemia: likely secondary to [**Last Name (un) 2406**]. EKG without evidence of peaked
   T waves. Repeat K have been within normal limits.
   - trend lytes
   # Diabetes: controlled on metformin at home
   -Insulin drip
   -Hold home meds
   #Hypertension.  Patient is now normotensive likely due to mild
   cardiogenic shock. Continue beta blocker
   - Hold ACEi given compromised kidney function
   - Hold Nifedipine
   - Continue with low dose  beta blocker if pressure tolerates
   #Trauma to face, s/p fall onto right side.  Patient denies LOC, altered
   sensorium, weakness, palpitations, preceding chest pain, and postictal
   state.  Patient is neurologically intact on exam.  No broken bones
   visible on CXray.
   -Will monitor for continued signs and symptoms.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presents with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for NSTEMI, including heparin, Plavix, aspirin, and high-dose atorvastatin. His biomarkers are elevated, and he has significant systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram.

The patient has developed acute pulmonary edema, which is likely secondary to aortic stenosis (AS) and compromised cardiac function. He has also developed acute kidney injury, which is likely secondary to the use of lasix and the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease. His creatinine has risen from 1.2-1.4 to 1.6, and he is at risk for further deterioration.

The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hyperkalemia likely secondary to his kidney dysfunction. He is receiving insulin therapy to control his blood sugar levels, and his hypertension is being managed with beta blockers.

The patient has a history of trauma to his face, which was caused by a fall onto his right side. He has no broken bones visible on CXR, and his neurological examination is intact.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for developing cardiogenic shock, which could be life-threatening.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine has risen, and he is at risk for further deterioration, which could lead to the need for dialysis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows pulmonary edema, and there is a possibility that he may have pneumonia, which could worsen his condition.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to his immobility and the use of heparin.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer due to his critical illness and the use of corticosteroids.
6. Vascular access complications: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, which could lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or dislodgment.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to his compromised immune system and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.
9. Malignant arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for developing malignant arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening."

   Imaging: [**2199-3-13**] CXR: Pulmonary edema. More confluent opacity in the

   consolidation/pneumonia (or contusion is posttraumatic) can not be
   excluded. Consider repeat after diuresis.
   [**2199-3-13**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
   normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is significant aortic stenosis that is
   probably severe (estimated aortic valve area ~0.8 cm2). No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
   Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
   effusion. No ventricular thrombus identified.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
   normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is significant aortic stenosis that is
   probably severe (estimated aortic valve area ~0.8 cm2). No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
   Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation, and a trans-thoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular hypokinetic dysfunction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient continues to require oxygen support due to acute pulmonary edema, which is likely secondary to aortic stenosis and compromised cardiac function.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has elevated biomarkers, and the echocardiogram shows significant systolic dysfunction. The patient is being considered for cardiac catheterization.
* Renal: The patient has acute on chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. The patient was given mucomyst before catheterization and is being closely monitored for further changes in renal function.
* Electrolytes: The patient has hyperkalemia, which is likely secondary to the patient's underlying medical conditions. The patient's potassium levels are being closely monitored.
* Hemodynamics: The patient has relative hypotension, but appears to be mentating well and has no evidence of hypoperfusion on examination.
* Neurological: The patient is neurologically intact on examination, with no signs of altered sensorium, weakness, or palpitations.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's significant systolic dysfunction and acute pulmonary edema, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic kidney disease and compromised cardiac function increase the risk of further renal deterioration.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's acute pulmonary edema and compromised cardiac function increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and compromised cardiac function increase the risk of further electrolyte imbalances.
* Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and cardiac catheterization increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Cardiac catheterization: The patient is being considered for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate the extent of coronary artery disease and to determine the best course of treatment.
* Medical management: The patient is receiving medical management for NSTEMI, including heparin, Plavix, and aspirin.
* Diuresis: The patient is being carefully monitored for diuresis, with a focus on avoiding further renal deterioration.
* Glycemic control: The patient is receiving insulin drips to control blood sugar levels.
* Nutrition: The patient is NPO pending further evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his complex medical conditions and potential complications."

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent coronary angiography and successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a BMS. He has been experiencing relative hypotension, acute pulmonary edema, and acute kidney injury. He is also experiencing hyperkalemia and pernicious anemia. He is being treated with various medications, including clopidogrel, aspirin, atorvastatin, and beta blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of NSTEMI, depressed cardiac index, and moderate pulmonary hypertension, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which could worsen his condition.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.6, and he is experiencing poor urine output, which could worsen his kidney function.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's acute pulmonary edema could worsen his respiratory status and lead to further complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
5. Pernicious anemia: The patient's pernicious anemia could lead to anemia and other complications if not treated properly.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and history of NSTEMI, there is a risk of DVT, which could lead to further complications.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and immobility could increase his risk of VAP, which could lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's cardiac function and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue treatment for pulmonary edema and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue treatment for pernicious anemia and monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels.
6. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of DVT.
7. Consider rotating the patient's antibiotic therapy to reduce the risk of VAP.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment as necessary.
9. Consider adjusting the patient's beta blocker therapy to reduce the risk of cardiogenic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS in the proximal RCA. The patient has a complex medical history, including a recent fall, and is currently experiencing mild hypoxia, murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and acute pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation may lead to heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
	* Depressed cardiac index and moderate pulmonary hypertension may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Mild hypoxia and bibasilar crackles on lung examination may indicate early signs of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
	* Acute pulmonary edema may worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Elevated creatinine levels (1.9 mg/dL) may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
	* Poor perfusion and decreased cardiac output may worsen renal function.
4. Neurological Complications:
	* The patient's recent fall and lack of neurological deficits on examination may indicate a risk of future falls and neurological complications.
	* The patient's age and medical history may increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
5. Infection Complications:
	* The patient's history of diabetes and hypertension may increase the risk of infection.
	* The patient's recent fall and lack of fever, cough, or other symptoms may indicate a risk of secondary infection.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and address potential complications."

   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour post-cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient had a successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS, post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 103 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/66 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and their physical examination is significant for a soft, non-tender abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema is absent.

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 8.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 8.88 ng/mL
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal three-vessel coronary artery disease, with a 90% stenosis in the RCA, and a depressed cardiac index.

The patient's plan includes:

* ICU care
* Nutrition: Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Lines: 18-gauge and 20-gauge IV lines
* Prophylaxis: DVT (SQ UF heparin), stress ulcer (H2 blocker), and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis
* Medications: Infusions, antibiotics, and other medications as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* Heart failure, given the patient's depressed cardiac index and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction
* Pulmonary embolism, given the patient's moderate pulmonary hypertension
* Infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia, given the patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of antibiotics
* Bleeding complications, given the patient's use of anticoagulation therapy
* Contrast-induced nephropathy, given the patient's use of contrast media during the cardiac catheterization and PCI"

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He has three-vessel coronary artery disease, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. He underwent successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a BMS, and his biomarkers are trending downward. He has acute pulmonary edema, acute on chronic kidney disease, relative hypotension, and hyperkalemia. He is currently receiving oxygen therapy, IV fluids, and medications to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's relative hypotension and decreased cardiac index increase the risk of cardiogenic shock, which would require additional therapy, including possible pressor support.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute on chronic kidney disease and worsening creatinine levels increase the risk of acute kidney injury, which would require further monitoring and possible intervention.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute pulmonary edema and hypoxia increase the risk of respiratory failure, which would require further oxygen therapy and possible mechanical ventilation.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxia increase the risk of pneumonia, which would require further evaluation with PA/Lat CXR and possible antibiotics.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of DVT, which would require prophylactic therapy with SQ UF Heparin.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness and medications increase the risk of stress ulcer, which would require prophylactic therapy with H2 blocker.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP, which would require further evaluation and possible antibiotics.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's diabetes and hyperlipidemia increase the risk of metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia, which would require further monitoring and possible intervention."

   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old elderly individual who underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure, including a 90% stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA) with a successful placement of a bare metal stent (BMS). The patient has a history of three-vessel coronary artery disease, left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, depressed cardiac index, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.6°F (36.4°C), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels and mildly elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms.
	* Depressed cardiac index may indicate reduced cardiac output, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
	* Moderate pulmonary hypertension may increase the risk of right ventricular failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Bleeding complications:
	* The patient's hemoglobin levels are slightly decreased, and platelet count is within normal limits. However, the patient's coagulation profile is not reported, which may indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Infection complications:
	* The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but the risk of infection cannot be ruled out.
4. Renal complications:
	* The patient's creatinine levels are mildly elevated, which may indicate kidney dysfunction. The patient's glomerular filtration rate is not reported, but the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease cannot be ruled out.
5. Respiratory complications:
	* The patient's oxygen therapy may be necessary for an extended period, increasing the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications:
	* The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, which may indicate cardiac-related neurological complications, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease, and successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a BMS. The patient also has left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, depressed cardiac index, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated biomarkers, including troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, as well as mild hyperkalemia. His EKG shows sinus tachycardia and ST depression, and his physical examination reveals mild hypoxia, murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and acute pulmonary edema.

The patient's medical history includes a recent fall, which may be related to aortic stenosis, and a history of pernicious anemia, which is being treated with B12 injections.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac arrest due to depressed cardiac index and moderate pulmonary hypertension
	* Aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation may worsen cardiac function
	* Pulmonary edema may progress if preload dependence is not managed
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury due to poor perfusion and elevated creatinine
	* Hyperkalemia may worsen if not managed
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema and compromised cardiac function
	* Pneumonia is less likely given CXray findings and physical exam
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to depressed cardiac index and moderate pulmonary hypertension
	* Cognitive impairment due to age and underlying medical conditions
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis due to compromised immune function and underlying medical conditions
	* Pneumonia is less likely given CXray findings and physical exam"

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with diabetes, hyperlipedemia, and hypertension without past
   known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST depression
   consistent with NSTEMI.
   .
   # NSTEMI: TIMI score of 5.  Patient [**Name (NI) 10793**] has resolved.  S/P cath PCI
   w/BMS.  Patient denies past CV disease, but EKG suggests prior inferior
   MI.  Biomarkers remain elevated due to kidney function.
   -Semi-urgent cardiac catheterization within 48 hours from presentation.
   -Control HTN.
   -High dose Atorvastatin.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) 1167**], [**First Name3 (LF) 68**], IV heparin (guaic stools)
   -Low dose BB
   .
   #SOB, mild hypoxia. Murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral
   regurgitation.  Acute Pul edema most likely secondary to compromised
   cardiac function.  Recent fall may be related to AS.  Lack of effusions
   suggest acute evolution and NSTEMI contribution.  Less likely PNA given
   CXray findings, physical exam, and  lack of lack of fever, cough, or
   other symptoms.  Trauma evaluation felt that contusion was unlikely and
   patient does not demonstrate severe chest wall tenderness, deformities,
   or echymoses.
   -. Avoid intravascular depletion given Cr and AS, preload dependence.
   .
   #Elevated Cr, likely [**Last Name (un) 2406**] secondary to poor perfusion.  S/P Cath and 5
   doses N-acetlycysteine, patient continues to exhibit signs of renal
   hypoperfusion with elevated Cr 1.9, dry MM, and dark urine.  IVF given
   slowly out of concern for AS.  Patient's chronic renal disease is
   likely due to diabetes and hypertension with [**Last Name (un) 4578**] function of
   1.2-1.4.
   - Give 500cc bolus fluids
   - Follow Cr.
   -Hold metformin.
   -Maintain euvolemic by assessing BP, MM, and UOP while avoiding
   pulmonary edema as assessed by Pox and exam.
   .
   # Diabetes.  Patient required 8U insulin yesterday, but was NPO
   throughout day.
   -Insulin SS
   -Hold home meds
   .
   #Hypertension.  Patient is now normotensive/ relatively hypotensive
   likely due to mild cardiogenic shock and volume depletion. Continue
   beta blocker.  Hold home Nefidipine.
   -Hold ACEi relative hypotension and compromised kidney function.  Start
   prior to DC if BP tolerable.
   .
   #Electrolytes.  Hyperkalemia resolved. likely [**3-12**] [**Last Name (un) 2406**].  Mg PRN.
   Relative hypocalcemia likely due to decreased albumin.
   -Follow EKG for T waves, arrhythmia.  Consider Ca gluconate if needed.
   .
   #Trauma to face, s/p fall onto right side.  Patient denies LOC, altered
   sensorium, weakness, palpitations, preceding chest pain, and postictal
   state.  Patient is neurologically intact on exam.  No broken bones
   visible on CXray.
   -Will monitor for continued signs and symptoms.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a bare metal stent (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and is being treated with B12 supplements.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 116/66 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. His cardiac index is depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2, and his pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiac tamponade due to the PCI procedure
	* Heart failure due to depressed cardiac index and pulmonary hypertension
	* Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to contrast-induced nephropathy and decreased cardiac output
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to diabetes and hypertension
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia due to aspiration or respiratory failure
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to cardiac failure and pulmonary hypertension
4. Neurological complications:
	* Cerebral edema due to increased intracranial pressure
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to cardiac embolism or hypoperfusion
5. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
	* Small bowel obstruction or ileus due to decreased motility
6. Infection complications:
	* Sepsis due to bacteremia or pneumonia
	* Endocarditis due to cardiac catheterization and PCI

The patient's care plan should focus on managing these potential complications, including optimizing cardiac function, maintaining renal function, and preventing respiratory and neurological complications. Close monitoring of the patient's condition and timely intervention are essential to prevent and manage these complications."

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a bare-metal stent (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery. The patient has a complex medical history, including aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR), which may contribute to his symptoms.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Blood pressure (BP) 116/66 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 103 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate (RR) 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has mildly elevated right and moderately elevated left-sided filling pressures, with moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (PASP 49 mmHg).
* Laboratory results: The patient has elevated troponin-T levels (8.88 ng/mL), elevated creatinine (1.9 mg/dL), and decreased hemoglobin (9.4 g/dL).
* Imaging: The patient has a 90% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery, which was successfully treated with PCI and BMS.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) may contribute to symptoms such as shortness of breath (SOB), mild hypoxia, and murmurs.
	* The patient's cardiac index is depressed, which may indicate decreased cardiac function.
2. Renal complications:
	* The patient has elevated creatinine levels (1.9 mg/dL), which may indicate kidney dysfunction.
	* The patient has received N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy, which may help to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Neurological complications:
	* The patient has a history of falls and may be at risk for further falls due to compromised cardiac function and potential electrolyte imbalances.
	* The patient's neurological exam is normal, but it is essential to monitor for continued signs and symptoms of neurological deterioration.
4. Infection complications:
	* The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and may be at risk for infections due to compromised immune function.
	* The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for stress ulcer and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
5. Respiratory complications:
	* The patient has mild hypoxia, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
	* The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and may require further respiratory support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of infection and adjust prophylactic antibiotics as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as echocardiography or stress testing, to assess the patient's cardiac function and identify potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: CCATH
   1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three
   vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive
   disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with 70%
   stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
   proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis
   with diffuse disease distally.
   2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
   moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm Hg, PWCP
   mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was
   low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac index
   was
   depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was high
   normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance was
   elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
   3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision BMS,
   post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
   4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and Choice
   PT [**Name (NI) 10791**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
   additional
   radiation and contrast exposure.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Left greater than right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Depressed cardiac index.
   4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   5. Successful PCI of the RCA with BMS.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M with diabetes, hyperlipedemia, and hypertension without past
   known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST depression
   consistent with NSTEMI.
   .
   # NSTEMI: TIMI score of 5.  Patient [**Name (NI) 10793**] has resolved.  S/P cath PCI
   w/BMS.  Patient denies past CV disease, but EKG suggests prior inferior
   MI.  Biomarkers remain elevated due to kidney function.
   -Semi-urgent cardiac catheterization within 48 hours from presentation.
   -Control HTN.
   -High dose Atorvastatin.
   -Continue [**Last Name (LF) 1167**], [**First Name3 (LF) 68**], IV heparin (guaic stools)
   -Low dose BB
   .
   #SOB, mild hypoxia. Murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral
   regurgitation.  Acute Pul edema most likely secondary to compromised
   cardiac function.  Recent fall may be related to AS.  Lack of effusions
   suggest acute evolution and NSTEMI contribution.  Less likely PNA given
   CXray findings, physical exam, and  lack of lack of fever, cough, or
   other symptoms.  Trauma evaluation felt that contusion was unlikely and
   patient does not demonstrate severe chest wall tenderness, deformities,
   or echymoses.
   -. Avoid intravascular depletion given Cr and AS, preload dependence.
   .
   #Elevated Cr, likely [**Last Name (un) 2406**] secondary to poor perfusion.  S/P Cath and 5
   doses N-acetlycysteine, patient continues to exhibit signs of renal
   hypoperfusion with elevated Cr 1.9, dry MM, UOP 36cc/hr this AM, and
   dark urine.  JVP overestimates fluid status given MR.  IVF given slowly
   out of concern for AS.  Patient's chronic renal disease is likely due
   to diabetes and hypertension with [**Last Name (un) 4578**] function of 1.2-1.4.
   - Give 500cc bolus fluids
   - Follow Cr.
   -Hold metformin.
   -Maintain euvolemic by assessing BP, MM, and UOP while avoiding
   pulmonary edema as assessed by Pox and exam.
   .
   #Narrow complex AT. Patient remains stable.  No intervention now.
   .
   # Diabetes.  Patient required 8U insulin yesterday, but was NPO
   throughout day.
   -Insulin SS
   -Hold home meds
   .
   #Hypertension.  Patient is now normotensive/ relatively hypotensive
   likely due to mild cardiogenic shock and volume depletion. Continue
   beta blocker.  Hold home Nefidipine.
   -Hold ACEi relative hypotension and compromised kidney function.  Start
   prior to DC if BP tolerable.
   .
   #Electrolytes.  Hyperkalemia resolved. likely [**3-12**] [**Last Name (un) 2406**].  Mg PRN.
   Relative hypocalcemia likely due to decreased albumin.
   -Follow EKG for T waves, arrhythmia.  Consider Ca gluconate if needed.
   .
   #Trauma to face, s/p fall onto right side.  Patient denies LOC, altered
   sensorium, weakness, palpitations, preceding chest pain, and postictal
   state.  Patient is neurologically intact on exam.  No broken bones

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.2°C, heart rate 103 beats per minute, blood pressure 116/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on nasal cannula.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) 15 mmHg, pulmonary wedge pressure (PWCP) mean 23 mmHg, and pulmonary arterial pressure (PASP) 49 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 8.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, and troponin T 8.88 ng/mL.
* Echocardiogram: Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, depressed cardiac index, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
* Other findings: Mild hypoxia, murmurs concerning for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, and acute pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Cardiogenic shock due to compromised cardiac function
	+ Aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation leading to worsening heart failure
	+ Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload
* Renal complications:
	+ Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to poor perfusion and contrast exposure
	+ Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbation due to diabetes and hypertension
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Pneumonia (PNA) due to aspiration or respiratory failure
	+ Respiratory failure due to acute pulmonary edema
* Metabolic complications:
	+ Hyperglycemia due to diabetes and stress response
	+ Electrolyte imbalance due to kidney dysfunction and medication use
* Other complications:
	+ DVT and PE due to immobility and hypercoagulability
	+ Sepsis due to infection or inflammation

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after a fall onto his right side.

The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization with stenting of the right coronary artery (RCA) and has been prescribed medications including clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has also been diagnosed with acute pulmonary edema, which is being treated with oxygen therapy and diuresis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated biomarkers, including troponin-T and CK-MB, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) suggests prior inferior myocardial infarction. His echocardiogram shows significant systolic dysfunction.

The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, hypoxia, and bilateral crackles in the lung fields. His laboratory results also show hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and anemia.

The patient's medical history includes a fall onto his right side, which resulted in trauma to his face, and he has been treated with B12 injections for pernicious anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's acute pulmonary edema may worsen if not properly treated, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications if not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly treated, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay may increase his risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and compromised circulation may increase his risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and potentially life-threatening complications.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He has a history of recent BMS placement in the RCA. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm and blood pressure of 110/64 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. His physical examination is notable for bilateral radial and pedal pulses, and he has a soft, non-tender abdomen. His laboratory results show elevated biomarkers, including troponin-T and CK-MB. He has a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL and a potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L. His imaging studies show an improving asymmetrically distributed combined air space and interstitial pattern on CXR, which may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient's CXR shows an improving asymmetrically distributed combined air space and interstitial pattern, which may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further diuresis and oxygen therapy.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.2-1.4 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL, which may be due to acute kidney injury. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further evaluation and management.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 4.0 mEq/L, which may be due to hyperkalemia. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, which may be due to cardiogenic shock. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further evaluation and management.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows an improving asymmetrically distributed combined air space and interstitial pattern, which may be due to pneumonia. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further evaluation and management.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his age and immobility. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further evaluation and management.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his age and medical condition. This is a potential complication of NSTEMI and may require further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider further diuresis and oxygen therapy for the patient's acute pulmonary edema.
3. Consider further evaluation and management for the patient's acute kidney injury.
4. Consider further evaluation and management for the patient's hyperkalemia.
5. Consider further evaluation and management for the patient's cardiogenic shock.
6. Consider further evaluation and management for the patient's pneumonia.
7. Consider further evaluation and management for the patient's DVT.
8. Consider further evaluation and management for the patient's stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 90-year-old male with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension who presented with chest discomfort and ST depression consistent with NSTEMI. He has undergone catheterization and stenting of the RCA with BMS. He has elevated biomarkers, and his EKG suggests prior inferior MI. He has significant systolic dysfunction, and his kidney function is compromised.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's CXR shows asymmetrically distributed combined air space and interstitial pattern, which may be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema in the setting of recent MI. Continued radiographic follow-up may be helpful to exclude underlying infection.
2. **Cardiogenic Shock:** The patient's tachycardia may be due to relative hypotension, and if it worsens, it may be a sign of cardiogenic shock, which would require additional therapy, including possible pressor support.
3. **Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease:** The patient's creatinine has worsened from 1.2-1.4 to 1.6, and he has been treated with diuretics, which may have exacerbated the kidney injury. He is at risk for further kidney damage from contrast-induced nephropathy and may require close monitoring of his kidney function.
4. **Hyperkalemia:** The patient's potassium levels are elevated, likely secondary to his kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of his electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. **Tachyarrhythmias:** The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of underlying cardiac dysfunction, and if it persists, it may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. **Infection:** The patient's CXR shows a possible pulmonary infiltrate, which may be due to infection. Further evaluation, including a PA/Lat CXR, is necessary to exclude underlying infection.
7. **Pneumonia:** The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxia may be due to pneumonia, which would require further evaluation and treatment.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his diuretic therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medication as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his medication as necessary.
4. Continue to evaluate the patient's pulmonary status and adjust his oxygen therapy as necessary.
5. Consider starting ACEi once the patient's kidney function improves.
6. Repeat echo on Monday to assess the patient's cardiac function.
7. Refer the patient to cardiac rehab as an outpatient.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust his medication as necessary.
9. Consider starting a stress ulcer prophylaxis regimen.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust his insulin therapy as necessary."
