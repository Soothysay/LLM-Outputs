You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with dementia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and a history of depression/anxiety. He presented to the hospital after a witnessed mechanical fall at a rehabilitation facility with a comminuted left intertrochanteric femoral fracture, which was pinned in the emergency department (ED) with a plan to undergo operative fixation in the morning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 94 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 150/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His respiratory status is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a high normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 29.5%. His white blood cell count is elevated at 12.8 cells/μL, with a possible stress reaction or hemoconcentration. His creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, with a baseline creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL in the rehabilitation facility.

The patient's imaging studies show no acute intracranial abnormality on head computed tomography (CT) scan, no fracture of the cervical spine on CT spine, and a comminuted proximal left femur fracture on hip X-ray. His CT abdomen and pelvis show no acute intra-abdominal findings, but a 3 mm nonobstructing renal calculus and fluid-filled gallbladder without wall thickening.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Left femur fracture: Pinning in the ED, with orthopedic consultation for operative fixation today.
2. Hypotension: Resolving, with serial abdominal exams and repeat EKG.
3. Abdominal distension: Unclear baseline, with serial abdominal exams and aggressive bowel regimen.
4. Anemia: High normocytic, with serial Hct and transfusion goal of Hct 30.
5. Leukocytosis: Elevated, with possible stress reaction, hemoconcentration, or undiagnosed infectious source.
6. CKD: Unclear recent baseline creatinine, with renally dosed medications and monitoring of BUN and creatinine.
7. Dementia with behavioral disturbances: Continuing Quetiapine 150 mg daily.
8. Depression/anxiety: Continuing Citalopram 40 mg daily, with hold on Lorazepam due to increased narcotics and concern for impending delirium.
9. Elevated troponin: Baseline compared to prior, with repeat EKG.
10. BPH: Foley in place, with hold on Terazosin due to concern for hypotension.
11. GERD: Continuing PPI once advanced beyond NPO, with consideration of IV PPI empirically for possible GI source.
12. FEN: Maintenance IVF, with repletion of electrolytes PRN and ice chips/NPO for OR.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible undiagnosed infectious source.
2. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and potential respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's elevated troponin and history of cardiac disease.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's history of gastrointestinal disease and potential bleeding risk.
5. Infection: Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and potential immunocompromise.
6. Delirium: Given the patient's history of dementia and potential medication-induced delirium.
7. Wound complications: Given the patient's history of surgery and potential wound infection.
8. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and potential respiratory compromise.

The patient's code status is currently DNR (do not resuscitate), but the healthcare proxy has requested that the patient be made full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M, Russian speaking only, with dementia, CKD, BPH; presenting
   after witnessed mechanical fall at rehab with comminuted left
   intertrochanteric femoral fracture, pinned in ED with plan to go to OR
   in AM.
   .
   # Left femur fracture: Had pin placed in ED, leg kept in traction
   overnight. Ortho consult plan for operative fixation today. Given CKD,
   age, poor mental status at baseline, patient is high operative risk
   candidate for high risk surgery.  Most recent cardiac assessment Echo
   [**5-/2153**] with Ef 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild
   AR, MR & pulmonary artery hypertension.
    - NPO post-MN given mental status, position
    - Transfuse to Hct > 30, will re-check hematocrit today
    - Post-pin films pending
    - Pain management with standing Tylenol per rectum & PRN morphine
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved prior to admission to the ICU. Possibly [**2-10**]
   meds (Morphine IV multiple times), bleeding (no clear source though
   abdomen is somewhat firm; CT negative), undiagnosed infection (CXR
   prelim clear, U/A fairly unrevealing), cardiac event (flat troponins,
   poor quality EKG).  Most concerning features are new anemia, distended
   abdomen and ?behavioral change if ambulating without walker.
    - Final reads CT abdomen / pelvis, CXR
    - Serial adominal exams
    - Serial Hct, with transfusion goal: Hct 30
    - Telemetry
    - Repeat EKG
    - If recurs, consider TTE, check random cortisol
    - T&C x 4 units
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Unclear baseline.  Unclear if TTP but some
   element of voluntary guarding.  Formal CT report pending, but large
   amount of stool clearly visible in rectal vault. Prelim Abd/Pelvis
   without concerning features for acute pathology.
    - Serial abdominal exam
    - Final read CT Abd/Pelvix
    - Aggressive bowel regimen (give suppository today), consider
   disimpaction if tenderness or distension worsens.
   .
   # Anemia: High normocytic. Sub-optimal response to blood transfusions
   overnight. Goal Hct 30, given surgery. On B12 as outpatient. No
   evidence of external bleeding; no hematoma over hip but thigh firmness
   L>R this morning
    - Serial Hct Q6H
    - stool guaiac x 3
    - maintain active type/screen, several units cross matched for OR
   - Monitor thigh tension
 will call Ortho to do compartment pressures
   if concerning
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated to 12.8 with resolution to 9 on multiple
   repeat labs.  Possible stress reaction, hemoconcentration or
   undiagnosed infectious source. U/A unrevealing (few bacteria, negative
   leuks/nitrites). CXR negative for consolidation, pneumothorax, or
   pleural effusions.
    - Final read CT abdomen / pelvis
    - Monitor CBC
    - Culture if spikes fever
   .
   # CKD: Unclear recent baseline creatinine.  Most recent creatinine in
   OMR was 2.1 in [**8-16**].  Electrolytes generally normal. FeNa 0.7%,
   consistent with perfusion-related kidney injury. Improved from 1.9 on
   admission to 1.7 this morning, after IV fluids overnight.
    - Prior labs from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab RE: current baseline
    - Renally dose medications
    - Monitor BUN/creatinine
   .
   # Dementia with behavioural disturbances: In behavioural unit at [**Hospital 328**]
   Rehab.
   - Continue Quetiapine 150 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Niece will visit today
 try to orient patient and have family at
   bedside as often as possible
   .
   # Depression / Anxiety: Unclear severity.
    - Continue Citalopram 40 mg po daily
    - Hold Lorazepam given increased narcotics, concern for impending
   delirium
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Baseline compared to prior. EKG in MICU unchanged
   from prior
   .
   # BPH: Foley in place, hold Terazosin given concern for hypotension.
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI once advance beyond NPO.  If continued HCT drop
   would start IV PPI empirically for possible GI source.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, ice chips / NPO for
   OR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   intertrochanteric femoral fracture, pinned in ED with plan to go to OR
   in AM.
   .
   # Left femur fracture: Had pin placed in ED, leg kept in traction
   overnight. Ortho consult plan for operative fixation today. Given CKD,
   age, poor mental status at baseline, patient is high operative risk
   candidate for high risk surgery.  Most recent cardiac assessment Echo
   [**5-/2153**] with Ef 55%, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild
   AR, MR & pulmonary artery hypertension.
    - NPO post-MN given mental status, position
    - Transfuse to Hct > 30, will re-check hematocrit today
    - Post-pin films pending
    - Pain management with standing Tylenol per rectum & PRN morphine
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved prior to admission to the ICU. Possibly [**2-10**]
   meds (Morphine IV multiple times), bleeding (no clear source though
   abdomen is somewhat firm; CT negative), undiagnosed infection (CXR
   prelim clear, U/A fairly unrevealing), cardiac event (flat troponins,
   poor quality EKG).  Most concerning features are new anemia, distended
   abdomen and ?behavioral change if ambulating without walker.
    - Final reads CT abdomen / pelvis, CXR
    - Serial adominal exams
    - Serial Hct, with transfusion goal: Hct 30
    - Telemetry
    - Repeat EKG
    - If recurs, consider TTE, check random cortisol
    - T&C x 4 units
   .
   # Abdominal distension: Unclear baseline.  Unclear if TTP but some
   element of voluntary guarding.  Formal CT report pending, but large
   amount of stool clearly visible in rectal vault. Prelim Abd/Pelvis
   without concerning features for acute pathology.
    - Serial abdominal exam
    - Final read CT Abd/Pelvix
    - Aggressive bowel regimen (give suppository today), consider
   disimpaction if tenderness or distension worsens.
   .
   # Anemia: High normocytic. Sub-optimal response to blood transfusions
   overnight. Goal Hct 30, given surgery. On B12 as outpatient. No
   evidence of external bleeding; no hematoma over hip but thigh firmness
   L>R this morning
    - Serial Hct Q6H
    - stool guaiac x 3
    - maintain active type/screen, several units cross matched for OR
   - Monitor thigh tension
 will call Ortho to do compartment pressures
   if concerning
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated to 12.8 with resolution to 9 on multiple
   repeat labs.  Possible stress reaction, hemoconcentration or
   undiagnosed infectious source. U/A unrevealing (few bacteria, negative
   leuks/nitrites). CXR negative for consolidation, pneumothorax, or
   pleural effusions.
    - Final read CT abdomen / pelvis
    - Monitor CBC
    - Culture if spikes fever
   .
   # CKD: Unclear recent baseline creatinine.  Most recent creatinine in
   OMR was 2.1 in [**8-16**].  Electrolytes generally normal. FeNa 0.7%,
   consistent with perfusion-related kidney injury. Improved from 1.9 on
   admission to 1.7 this morning, after IV fluids overnight.
    - Prior labs from [**Hospital 328**] Rehab RE: current baseline
    - Renally dose medications
    - Monitor BUN/creatinine
   .
   # Dementia with behavioural disturbances: In behavioural unit at [**Hospital 328**]
   Rehab.
   - Continue Quetiapine 150 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Niece will visit today
 try to orient patient and have family at
   bedside as often as possible
   .
   # Depression / Anxiety: Unclear severity.
    - Continue Citalopram 40 mg po daily
    - Hold Lorazepam given increased narcotics, concern for impending
   delirium
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Baseline compared to prior. EKG in MICU unchanged
   from prior
   .
   # BPH: Foley in place, hold Terazosin given concern for hypotension.
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI once advance beyond NPO.  If continued HCT drop
   would start IV PPI empirically for possible GI source.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes PRN, ice chips / NPO for
   OR
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots given unclear source of blood loss, to OR in
   AM; post-OR will need anticoagulant given high risk Orthopedics surgery
 will reassess possibility of starting heparin SQ this afternoon if
   hemodynamically stable

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 90-year-old male with dementia, CKD, and BPH, was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed mechanical fall at a rehabilitation facility with a comminuted left intertrochanteric femoral fracture. The patient was pinned in the emergency department and was planned for operative fixation in the morning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/82 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a high normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 30.9%. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 12.8, but has resolved to 9.8 on repeat labs. The patient's creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and his electrolytes are generally normal.

The patient's imaging studies show no acute intracranial abnormality on head CT, and a CT of the cervical spine shows bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at multiple levels. A hip X-ray shows an acute comminuted proximal left femur fracture, and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis shows no acute intra-abdominal findings.

The patient's medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of depression and anxiety. The patient is also taking medications for dementia, including quetiapine and citalopram.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's anemia and respiratory compromise may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's elevated troponin level and history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of depression and anxiety may increase the risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's CKD and history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia may increase the risk of renal failure.
6. Surgical complications: The patient's high-risk surgery and history of bleeding may increase the risk of surgical complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Blood transfusions to correct anemia
2. Antibiotics for potential infection
3. Pain management with morphine and acetaminophen
4. Respiratory support with oxygen therapy
5. Cardiovascular support with vasopressors and inotropes as needed
6. Renal support with fluid management and electrolyte replacement
7. Surgical fixation of the left femur fracture
8. Prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but the family has requested that the patient be converted to full code status."
