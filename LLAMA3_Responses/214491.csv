   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   .
   # Chest pain. Differential includes ACS, cocaine induced chest pain,
   pericarditis versus costacondiritis. Unlikely ACS as recent cath [**2155**]
   no CAD (however could be cocaine induced ischemia), no acute changes on
   EKG and was recently admitted with negative rule out. Pain is not
   positional and no changes on EKG to suggest pericarditis. Pain is not
   reproducible to palpation to suggest costachondritis. Most likely
   cocaine induced chest pain based on recent use and prior history.
   - ROMI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He presented with shortness of breath and chest pain in the setting of cocaine abuse and missing hemodialysis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for management of his condition.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.3°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm) with a sinus rhythm
* Blood pressure: 161/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 182 K/uL
* Creatinine: 9.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.23 ng/mL

The patient has been treated with IV diltiazem for tachycardia, and nitroglycerin for hypertension. He has also received dialysis, and his electrolytes are being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CXR shows bilateral airspace opacities, likely due to pulmonary edema. This can lead to respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a productive cough and a history of cocaine abuse, which increases his risk of infection. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics may be necessary if the cultures are positive.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial arrhythmia and is currently experiencing tachycardia. This can increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has a history of ESRD. This increases his risk of hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which can increase his risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap is elevated, which may be due to renal failure from chronic kidney disease. This can lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
7. Cocaine withdrawal: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse, and withdrawal symptoms can occur when he stops using the drug. This can lead to cardiovascular instability, respiratory depression, and other complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent these complications and ensure his safe and effective treatment."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and chest pain. He has a history of cocaine abuse and missed his scheduled HD session. The patient is currently receiving HD and has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, likely secondary to volume overload. He also has hypertension, hyperkalemia, and tachycardia, which are being managed with various medications. The patient is also being treated for possible cocaine-induced chest pain and is awaiting blood culture results.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Volume overload: The patient's pulmonary edema and effusions may worsen if he does not receive adequate HD and diuresis.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may persist or worsen if he does not receive adequate oxygen therapy and diuresis.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may worsen if he does not receive adequate HD and potassium-lowering therapy.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen if he does not receive adequate beta-blocker therapy and if his underlying cardiac condition is not well-managed.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if he does not receive adequate antihypertensive therapy and if his volume overload is not well-managed.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD may worsen if he does not receive adequate HD and if his underlying kidney disease is not well-managed.
7. Cocaine abuse: The patient's cocaine abuse may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and increased risk of infection.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment for his underlying kidney disease and if his electrolyte imbalances are not well-managed.
9. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen if he does not receive adequate treatment and support, which may lead to decreased compliance with his medical regimen and increased risk of suicide."

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   # Chest pain
   Likely angina with some myocardial ischemia, not severe enough for
   enzyme leak. Although PNA unlikely, may be pleuritic component (less
   likely)
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   # Hypoxia
   Missed HD with significant volume overload. Superimposed infection not
   obvious on CXR, but possible given rising WBC and productive cough. PE
   on differential but alternate explanations adequate.
   - HD and diuresis
   - Attempt to wean respiratory support (no n.c.)
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter
   Patient with baseline Aflutter; often demonstrating 2:1 conduction.
   Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert back to long-acting dilt. on discharge
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes.
   # Hyperkalemia/hyperphsophatemia
   With ESRD and poor adherence to HD.
   - Tele for now (and likely on floor depending on events in record)
   - Continue HD
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI
   # Hypertension
   Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   # ESRD on HD
   Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD again today
   - Managment of K
   - Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who missed his dialysis appointment and used cocaine. He presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/69 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula. His white blood cell count is trending up, and he has a bilateral pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has missed HD, leading to significant volume overload, and may have a superimposed infection.
2. Tachycardia/Aflutter: The patient has a baseline atrial arrhythmia, and his heart rate is elevated.
3. Hyperkalemia/Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has ESRD and poor adherence to HD, leading to electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypertension: The patient has secondary hypertension due to volume overload.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient is overdue for HD and needs continued management of his kidney disease.
6. Depression: The patient's missed HD and recent admission for similar complaints may be contributing to his depression.
7. Cocaine abuse: The patient's cocaine use is a significant concern and may be exacerbating his medical conditions.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 21, likely secondary to his CKD.

The patient is being managed with statins, aspirin, and dilaudid for pain control, and is being encouraged to stop using cocaine. He is receiving HD and diuresis, and his electrolytes are being managed. The patient is also being monitored for signs of infection and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
   60M with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, atrial arrhythmia, CHF, presenting with
   shortness of breath and chest pain in setting of cocaine abuse and
   missing hemodialysis.
   # Chest pain
   Likely angina with some myocardial ischemia, not severe enough for
   enzyme leak. Although PNA unlikely, may be pleuritic component (less
   likely)
   - Continue statin; hold ACEI with increased K. Received ASA by EMS,
   continue 81 mg daily
   - BP control/decrease of myocardial demand
   - For pain control dilaudid, percocet and benzodiazepines prn
   - Encourage cessation of cocaine abuse
   # Hypoxia
   Missed HD with significant volume overload. Superimposed infection not
   obvious on CXR, but possible given rising WBC and productive cough. PE
   on differential but alternate explanations adequate.
   - HD (next session tomorrow) and diuresis
   - Attempt to wean respiratory support (no n.c.)
   - Hold off on antibiotics as no fever, no leukocytosis; likely volume
   overload given clinical history
   # Tachycardia/Aflutter
   Patient with baseline Aflutter; often demonstrating 2:1 conduction.
   Patient required diltiazem 10 mg IV for HR 170s.
   - Avoid BBs due to history of cocaine use.
   - Convert back to long-acting dilt. on discharge
   - Cannot anticoagulate long term given GIBs per past notes.
   # Hyperkalemia/hyperphsophatemia
   With ESRD and poor adherence to HD.
   - Tele for now (and likely on floor depending on events in record)
   - Continue HD
   - If ECG changes (peaked Ts) develop, give calcium, insulin and D50
   - Glucose control to encourage intracellular entry
   - Hold ACEI
   # Hypertension
   Secondary to volume overload.
   - Avoid BB due to cocaine use
   - Diltiazem 60 mg QID
   - If poorly controlled 190s or greater start nitro drip
   # ESRD on HD
   Overdue for HD as above.
   - HD again today
   - Managment of K
   - Continue renagel/nephrocaps/renal diet
   # Asterixis and Mental Status
   Typical DDx with asterixis include hypercarbia, uremia and hepatic
   encephalopathy. Each also produce mental status changes. He is somewhat
   inattentive. Most likely uremic
   - Follow
   # Cocaine abuse
   [**Last Name **] problem for patient.
   - SW consult.
   # Metabolic acidosis.
   Anion gap 21. Lactate normal. Likely secondary to renal failure from
   CKD.
   - Management as above.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who missed his dialysis session and took cocaine, presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. He has a history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), atrial arrhythmia, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is being treated for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): Given the patient's history of CAD and chest pain, there is a risk of MI, which could be exacerbated by the cocaine use.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrate on CXR and rising white blood cell count suggest a possible superimposed infection, which could lead to PE.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea may indicate respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by the volume overload and possible infection.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial arrhythmia and tachycardia increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which could be exacerbated by the cocaine use.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's ESRD and poor adherence to hemodialysis increase the risk of hyperkalemia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap of 21 and lactate normal suggest a possible metabolic acidosis, which could be secondary to renal failure from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
7. Infection: The patient's rising white blood cell count and productive cough suggest a possible infection, which could be superimposed on the patient's underlying conditions.
8. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid overload and hypertension suggest a possible volume overload, which could exacerbate his underlying conditions.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and radiological imaging to identify any potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pulmonary edema. He has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic kidney disease, and polysubstance abuse. The patient's 24-hour events include dialysis removal of 4.7L of fluid, and he continues to require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 109bpm, and blood pressure of 133/73mmHg. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.31.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished, thin individual with symmetric chest expansion and diminished breath sounds. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and his peripheral vascular examination shows absent radial and digital pulses. His abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and his neurologic examination shows an attentive patient who follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8, hemoglobin of 9.4g/dL, platelet count of 156, and creatinine of 9.9mg/dL. His troponin-T is elevated at 0.43, and his glucose is 84mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and tachypnea increase his risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and flutter may worsen with continued stress and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infection: The patient's polysubstance abuse history and chronic kidney disease increase his risk of infection.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and history of polysubstance abuse increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypertension: The patient's chronic kidney disease and polysubstance abuse history increase his risk of hypertension.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's chronic kidney disease and polysubstance abuse history increase his risk of hyperkalemia.
7. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and polysubstance abuse history increase his risk of worsening renal failure.

Based on the patient's conditions and laboratory results, it is essential to continue close monitoring of his vital signs, respiratory support, and laboratory results to prevent or address potential complications."
