   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   CC: s/p esophageal stent placment admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory
   distress
   .
   HPI: This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA,
   s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal
   stenting, now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   The follow history is taken from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 **] notes. The
   patient underwent EGD in [**2113-9-30**] for w/u anemia. She was found to
   have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma. On [**11-1**], she
   underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube
   placment. She was discharged home on [**11-9**] but returned to the ED later
   that day for hematemasis. EGD was done showing some clots in the
   stomach but no active bleeding. The follwing day she had another
   episode of hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively
   intubated for airway protection.  She underwent repeat endoscopy which
   showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis
   with oozing. She then underwent exlap on [**11-11**] where a tear in the
   capusle of the spleen was found, but was not able to be repaired given
   concerns with disrupting the anastomosis. [**Female First Name (un) **] was controlled with
   thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped. She then underwent an
   arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseuoaneurysm. She was transfussed
   multipe unitls during these few days, HCT around 26. She was on Zosyn
   and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.
   .
   She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] SICU for treatment on the pseudoaneurysm.
   She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic artery aneursym. She was
   weaned off the ventilator. However, she was noted to be on 3L NC duirng
   ambulance transport. Lasix was given. There was a question of vomiting
   enroute. She was then reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and
   hypotension on [**11-18**]. She was diuresed for the following two days and
   then extubated on [**11-20**]. On [**11-20**], she underwent CT chest, which only
   showed moderate pleural effusions. On [**11-22**], she was switched from
   Zosyn to Cefepime.
   .
   During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the GE
   junction by the NG tube. NGT was pulled back and secured.Gastrografin
   swallow  on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of
   the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm. She was then transfered
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for esophagastric stenting.
   .
   Here she underwent ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal 9cm x10mm
   stent proximal clipping. She stent placement was verified by a
   pediatric scope. She had been electively intubated prior to the
   procedure and was extubated post ERCP. Post proceedure, she was
   ordered125ml/hr NS; she likely received 400cc LR during the procedure.
   She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's,
   no documented hypoxia.  She was then reintubated in the PACU. She was
   given lasix 20mg IV in the PACU. She was transfered to the floor on AC
   500x 14, FI02 50%, PEEP 5.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p
   resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting,
   now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Characterized as tachypnea. This is the fourth
   time she has been intubated - 1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3)
   for ERCP 4)respiratory distress. Per the family, she had significant
   anxiety on one extubation to the extent that she needed to be
   reintubated immediately [**2-13**] distress; she was anxious that her husband
   was not present. This level of anxiety may have resulted in
   reintubation today. However, there is also evidence of volume overload
   on CXR and given the rapidity with which she went into distress, she
   may have had flash pulmonary edema. No PNA, no sputum production, fever
   or leukocytosis. No hypoxia on ABG. Of note, she was sat'ing 98% on 3L
   NC prior to ERCP.
   - intubated, propofol and fentanyl
   - diurese with lasix 10mg IV, f/u UOP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p
   resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting,
   now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Characterized as tachypnea. This is the fourth
   time she has been intubated - 1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3)
   for ERCP 4)respiratory distress. Per the family, she had significant
   anxiety on one extubation to the extent that she needed to be
   reintubated immediately [**2-13**] distress; she was anxious that her husband
   was not present. This level of anxiety may have resulted in
   reintubation today. However, there is also evidence of volume overload
   on CXR and given the rapidity with which she went into distress, she
   may have had flash pulmonary edema. No PNA, no sputum production, fever
   or leukocytosis. No hypoxia on ABG. Of note, she was sat'ing 98% on 3L
   NC prior to ERCP.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric cancer, s/p resection, and esophageal stenting. She was admitted to the ICU after intubation for respiratory distress. The patient has a complex medical history, including breast cancer, partial thyroidectomy, and bladder cancer. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, which has led to multiple intubations. The patient's current condition is characterized by tachypnea, no documented hypoxia, and evidence of volume overload on CXR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anastomotic leak: The patient has a contained anastomotic leak to the left of the remaining stomach, which may lead to further complications, such as infection, abscess formation, or perforation.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's repeated episodes of respiratory distress may lead to further complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or respiratory failure.
3. Volume overload: The patient's evidence of volume overload on CXR may lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of bleeding, surgery, and intubation may increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to further complications, such as organ failure or death.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastric cancer and gastrectomy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension and thyroid cancer may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of breast cancer and partial thyroidectomy may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive impairment.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory distress, anastomotic leak, and volume overload. The plan is to intubate the patient and provide mechanical ventilation, diurese with lasix, and nebs. The patient will also receive antibiotics for prophylaxis against infection. The plan is to consider peri-extubation CPAP and nitro drip, as well as echo for diastolic dysfunction. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further work-up and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   CC: s/p esophageal stent placment admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory
   distress
   .
   HPI: This is a 74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA,
   s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal
   stenting, now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   The follow history is taken from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 **] notes. The
   patient underwent EGD in [**2113-9-30**] for w/u anemia. She was found to
   have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma. On [**11-1**], she
   underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube
   placment. She was discharged home on [**11-9**] but returned to the ED later
   that day for hematemasis. EGD was done showing some clots in the
   stomach but no active bleeding. The follwing day she had another
   episode of hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively
   intubated for airway protection.  She underwent repeat endoscopy which
   showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis
   with oozing. She then underwent exlap on [**11-11**] where a tear in the
   capusle of the spleen was found, but was not able to be repaired given
   concerns with disrupting the anastomosis. [**Female First Name (un) **] was controlled with
   thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped. She then underwent an
   arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseuoaneurysm. She was transfussed
   multipe unitls during these few days, HCT around 26. She was on Zosyn
   and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.
   .
   She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] SICU for treatment on the pseudoaneurysm.
   She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic artery aneursym. She was
   weaned off the ventilator. However, she was noted to be on 3L NC duirng
   ambulance transport. Lasix was given. There was a question of vomiting
   enroute. She was then reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and
   hypotension on [**11-18**]. She was diuresed for the following two days and
   then extubated on [**11-20**]. On [**11-20**], she underwent CT chest, which only
   showed moderate pleural effusions. On [**11-22**], she was switched from
   Zosyn to Cefepime.
   .
   During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the GE
   junction by the NG tube. NGT was pulled back and secured.Gastrografin
   swallow  on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of
   the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm. She was then transfered
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for esophagastric stenting.
   .
   Here she underwent ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal 9cm x10mm
   stent proximal clipping. She stent placement was verified by a
   pediatric scope. She had been electively intubated prior to the
   procedure and was extubated post ERCP. Post proceedure, she was
   ordered125ml/hr NS; she likely received 400cc LR during the procedure.
   She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's,
   no documented hypoxia.  She was then reintubated in the PACU. She was
   given lasix 20mg IV in the PACU. She was transfered to the floor on AC
   500x 14, FI02 50%, PEEP 5.

   # Respiratory distress: Characterized as tachypnea. This is the fourth
   time she has been intubated - 1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3)
   for ERCP 4)respiratory distress. Per the family, she had significant
   anxiety on one extubation to the extent that she needed to be
   reintubated immediately [**2-13**] distress; she was anxious that her husband
   was not present. This level of anxiety may have resulted in
   reintubation today. However, there is also evidence of volume overload
   on CXR and given the rapidity with which she went into distress, she
   may have had flash pulmonary edema. No PNA, no sputum production, fever
   or leukocytosis. No hypoxia on ABG. Of note, she was sat'ing 98% on 3L

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   s/p resection transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal
   stenting, now admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory stress.
   The follow history is taken from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 **] notes. The
   patient underwent EGD in [**2113-9-30**] for w/u anemia. She was found to
   have a gastric mass, poorly differentiated adenocarinoma. On [**11-1**], she
   underwent partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube
   placment. She was discharged home on [**11-9**] but returned to the ED later
   that day for hematemasis. EGD was done showing some clots in the
   stomach but no active bleeding. The follwing day she had another
   episode of hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively
   intubated for airway protection.  She underwent repeat endoscopy which
   showed a small separtion in one portion of the esophagastric anatomosis
   with oozing. She then underwent exlap on [**11-11**] where a tear in the
   capusle of the spleen was found, but was not able to be repaired given
   concerns with disrupting the anastomosis. [**Female First Name (un) **] was controlled with
   thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped. She then underwent an
   arteriogram showing a 6mm splnic pseuoaneurysm. She was transfussed
   multipe unitls during these few days, HCT around 26. She was on Zosyn
   and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.
   .
   She was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] SICU for treatment on the pseudoaneurysm.
   She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic artery aneursym. She was
   weaned off the ventilator. However, she was noted to be on 3L NC duirng
   ambulance transport. Lasix was given. There was a question of vomiting
   enroute. She was then reintubated on [**11-18**] for respiratory distress and
   hypotension on [**11-18**]. She was diuresed for the following two days and
   then extubated on [**11-20**]. On [**11-20**], she underwent CT chest, which only
   showed moderate pleural effusions. On [**11-22**], she was switched from
   Zosyn to Cefepime.
   .
   During this time a CT abdomen, demonstrated perforation of the GE
   junction by the NG tube. NGT was pulled back and secured.Gastrografin
   swallow  on [**2113-11-23**] showed a contained anastomotic leak to the left of
   the remaining stomach measuring approx 6x3cm. She was then transfered
   to [**Hospital1 1**] for esophagastric stenting.
   .
   Here she underwent ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal 9cm x10mm
   stent proximal clipping. She stent placement was verified by a
   pediatric scope. She had been electively intubated prior to the
   procedure and was extubated post ERCP. Post proceedure, she was
   ordered125ml/hr NS; she likely received 400cc LR during the procedure.
   She then developed respiratory distress with respiratory rates in 40's,
   no documented hypoxia.  She was then reintubated in the PACU. She was
   given lasix 20mg IV in the PACU. She was transfered to the floor on AC
   500x 14, FI02 50%, PEEP 5.

   # Respiratory distress: Characterized as tachypnea. This is the fourth
   time she has been intubated - 1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3)
   for ERCP 4)respiratory distress. Per the family, she had significant
   anxiety on one extubation to the extent that she needed to be
   reintubated immediately [**2-13**] distress; she was anxious that her husband
   was not present. This level of anxiety may have resulted in
   reintubation today. However, there is also evidence of volume overload
   on CXR and given the rapidity with which she went into distress, she
   may have had flash pulmonary edema. No PNA, no sputum production, fever
   or leukocytosis. No hypoxia on ABG. Of note, she was sat'ing 98% on 3L
   NC prior to ERCP.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who underwent gastric cancer resection and esophageal stenting. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, which has been a recurring issue since her initial admission. The patient has a history of gastric cancer, breast cancer, partial thyroidectomy, and bladder cancer. She is currently intubated and sedated, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 99%.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including ERCP with esophagogastric metal stent placement, which was complicated by a contained anastomotic leak. She has also had multiple episodes of hematemesis, which has been managed with endoscopy and thrombin-soaked gel foam.

The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory distress, which is thought to be related to volume overload and possibly flash pulmonary edema. She is being treated with diuretics, nebs, and FiO2. The patient's anastomotic leak is being managed with antibiotics and antifungal medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress could progress to respiratory failure, which would require invasive mechanical ventilation and potentially lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
2. Anastomotic leak: The patient's contained anastomotic leak could worsen and lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's multiple episodes of hematemesis and anastomotic leak increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and respiratory distress increase her risk of developing pneumonia, which could be complicated by the patient's underlying medical conditions.
5. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's TWI on EKG could be indicative of diastolic dysfunction, which could lead to heart failure and further complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hematemesis and anastomotic leak increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
7. Wound infection: The patient's midline healing incision could become infected, leading to further complications and prolonged hospitalization.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Continue to manage the patient's anastomotic leak with antibiotics and antifungal medication, and consider further interventions such as stent placement or surgical revision.
3. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction.
4. Consider early mobilization and physical therapy to prevent respiratory and gastrointestinal complications.
5. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort with medication and other interventions, and consider referral to pain management specialists if necessary.
6. Consider referral to gastroenterology and cardiology specialists for further management of the patient's anastomotic leak and diastolic dysfunction.
7. Continue to educate the patient and her family about her condition, treatment options, and potential complications to ensure informed decision-making."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complicated GI history who was admitted for stent placement in the connection between her esophagus and stomach. She developed acute respiratory distress post-extubation following the procedure and was reintubated in the PACU. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 100%. She has a history of anemia, and her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/48 mmHg, and a temperature of 37.7°C. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation. She may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of anemia, which may be a sign of underlying sepsis. She is receiving antibiotics, but further evaluation is needed to rule out sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's ECG shows T-wave inversions laterally, which may be a sign of cardiac ischemia. She is receiving beta blockers and diuretics, but further monitoring is needed to rule out cardiac complications.
4. Volume overload: The patient has a history of volume overload, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress. She is receiving diuretics, but further evaluation is needed to rule out volume overload.
5. Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress. She is receiving bronchodilators, but further evaluation is needed to rule out aspiration.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress. She is receiving antibiotics, but further evaluation is needed to rule out infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to evaluate the patient for sepsis and cardiac complications, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's volume status and adjust her diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Consider adding bronchodilators to the patient's treatment plan to help manage her respiratory distress.
5. Consider adding IV TNG to the patient's treatment plan to help manage her respiratory distress.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
7. Consider adding stress ulcer prophylaxis to the patient's treatment plan to help manage her risk of stress ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old female, is a post-gastrectomy patient with a recently diagnosed gastric cancer who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory stress. She was intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her condition is stable, with no significant changes in her vital signs, laboratory results, or imaging studies. She is at risk for pulmonary edema post-extubation and will require close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema post-extubation, which can be life-threatening. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and fluid balance is essential.
2. Anastamotic Leak: The patient has a history of anastamotic leak, which can lead to sepsis and other complications. Continuous antibiotics and antifungal therapy are necessary to prevent infection.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a J-tube and tube feeds, which can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status is essential.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving medications to control her blood pressure. Close monitoring of her cardiovascular status is essential to prevent cardiovascular complications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppressed state. Close monitoring of her laboratory results and imaging studies is essential to detect any signs of infection early.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her anastamotic leak and immunosuppressed state. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect any signs of sepsis early.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential to prevent respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted with acute respiratory failure post-extubation in the PACU. The patient's condition has been stabilized, and they are currently being managed in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/66 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a SpO2 of 94% on 40% FiO2. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show that they have a white blood cell count of 12.6, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 465 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal limits, with a sodium of 138 mmol/L, potassium of 4.6 mmol/L, and chloride of 28 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, which has been poorly controlled in the past, leading to flash pulmonary edema. The patient is currently receiving treatment with metoprolol and valsartin, and their blood pressure is being closely monitored.

The patient's physical examination is significant for crackles in the dependent lung fields, indicating a possible pulmonary edema. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and their extremities are without edema.

The patient's neurologic examination is significant for attentive behavior, with the ability to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli. The patient's tone is not assessed due to their respiratory distress.

The patient's diagnosis is acute respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to their poorly controlled hypertension. The patient's plan is to receive lasix and IV TNG to decrease preload, and to anticipate extubation in the morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are at risk for developing pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response, which can lead to sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and flash pulmonary edema put them at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are at risk for developing respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory distress make them susceptible to infection.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase their risk of bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and they require close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was recently diagnosed with gastric cancer, underwent resection, and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory stress. She was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently being monitored for potential complications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/59 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary edema post-extubation, which may be exacerbated by her recent gastric surgery and potential anastomotic leak.
2. Anastomotic Leak: The patient has a history of anastomotic leak and is at risk for further complications, including sepsis and peritonitis.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent gastric surgery and potential anastomotic leak increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be life-threatening.
4. Wound Infection: The patient's midline healing incision is at risk for infection, which may be complicated by her recent surgery and potential anastomotic leak.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent respiratory failure and potential anastomotic leak increase her risk for further respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's recent surgery and potential anastomotic leak increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Infection: The patient's recent surgery and potential anastomotic leak increase her risk for infection, which may be life-threatening.
8. Nutritional Complications: The patient's recent surgery and potential anastomotic leak increase her risk for nutritional complications, including malnutrition and dehydration.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current plan includes ongoing monitoring for potential complications, including pulmonary edema, anastomotic leak, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She will also require ongoing nutritional support and close monitoring of her laboratory results. Further surgical consultation and management will be necessary to address her anastomotic leak and potential gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old female, was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently being managed in the ICU. She is complaining of nausea, but her pain is under control. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 98% on 3L NC. Her vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/59 mmHg. She has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place.

The patient has a recent history of gastric cancer, and underwent resection and esophageal stenting. She was intubated for respiratory stress and is now being managed in the ICU. She has a J-tube in place for tube feeds and a JP drain in place for management of anastamotic leak.

Potential medical complications:

1. Anastamotic leak: The patient's recent history of gastric cancer and esophageal stenting increases the risk of anastamotic leak. Close monitoring of the patient's abdominal status and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to identify any complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent history of respiratory stress and intubation increases the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to identify any complications.
3. Infection: The patient's recent history of gastric cancer and esophageal stenting increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to identify any complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient's recent history of gastric cancer and esophageal stenting increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to identify any complications.
5. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's recent history of gastric cancer and esophageal stenting increases the risk of diastolic dysfunction. Further evaluation with echocardiography may be necessary to identify any complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's recent history of gastric cancer and esophageal stenting increases the risk of hypertension. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to identify any complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's recent history of gastric cancer and esophageal stenting increases the risk of hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of the patient's blood glucose levels and further evaluation with imaging studies may be necessary to identify any complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with recently diagnosed gastric cancer, who underwent resection and was transferred to the ICU for esophageal stenting. The patient was intubated for respiratory stress and is now extubated.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including lasix, zofran, and compazine for nausea, as well as furosemide, labetalol, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate for other conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/59 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 98%. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is being monitored for pulmonary edema.

The patient's abdominal wound is healing well, with minimal serosanguinous fluid drainage and no signs of infection.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.1, hemoglobin of 28.9, and platelet count of 479. The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and the patient's troponin-T level is 0.02 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for pulmonary edema post-extubation and will need to be monitored closely.
2. Anastamotic leak: The patient will continue to receive cefepime and fluconazole, and a surgery consult will be obtained.
3. S/p gastrectomy: The patient will continue to receive tube feeds and J-tube, and will transition back to percocet and dilauded for pain management.
4. TWI on EKG: The patient's TWI in V5, V6 has resolved, and enzymes are flat.
5. HTN: The patient will continue to receive metoprolol and diovan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient is at risk for pulmonary edema post-extubation and will need to be monitored closely.
2. Anastamotic leak: The patient may experience further complications related to the anastamotic leak, such as infection or bleeding.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the gastrectomy and may require further management.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's HTN and cardiac history may increase their risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the surgical site and may require further management.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and they will require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was recently diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent resection. She was transferred to the ICU after intubation for respiratory stress and was extubated today. She is currently receiving various medications, including lasix, zofran, and compazine, and has a nasogastric tube and tube feeds. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/59 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and a PSV/SBT ventilator mode. She has a history of anastomotic leak and is being treated with cefepime and fluconazole. She also has a history of hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol and diovan.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's recent intubation and respiratory stress may increase her risk of developing pulmonary edema, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Anastomotic leak: The patient's history of anastomotic leak and ongoing treatment with cefepime and fluconazole may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as infection or bleeding.
3. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and ongoing treatment with metoprolol and diovan may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or kidney damage.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastric cancer and ongoing treatment with tube feeds may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's history of recent surgery and ongoing treatment with antibiotics may increase her risk of developing infection.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent intubation and respiratory stress may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which could worsen her overall condition.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and ongoing treatment with metoprolol and diovan may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Kidney damage: The patient's history of hypertension and ongoing treatment with lasix may increase her risk of developing kidney damage.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of tube feeds may increase her risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a postoperative patient with respiratory failure, currently extubated and receiving nasal cannula oxygen. They have a history of hypertension, which is not well controlled, and are receiving antibiotics and fluconazole for an anastomotic leak. The patient has been diuresed and is experiencing nausea, which is being managed with medication. They are tired and have a normal heart rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 153/79 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Their respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and intermittent positive pressure ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels. Their troponin-T level is normal, and their electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory failure and history of anastomotic leak, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's anastomotic leak is ongoing, and there is a risk of further complications, such as bleeding or infection.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well controlled, and there is a risk of further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there is a risk of further complications, such as respiratory arrest or need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection: The patient's history of anastomotic leak and respiratory failure increases their risk of developing an infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anastomotic leak increases their risk of bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and history of cardiac surgery increase their risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient well known to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] service as just transferred to the
   medical floor yesterday.  Now s/p cardiac arrest, reportedly vfib,
   resusitated and intubated.  Lfabs notable for hypkalemia and
   hypophosphatemia which have been repleted.  Following transfer to ICU
   patient had placement of right IJ under US guidance, uncomplicated
   procedure.  Became hypotensive after procedure.  CXR shows line in
   SVC/RV juncture, no PTX. Line pulled back.  No hematoma at insertion
   site.  Resusitated with 2 L NS, labs notable for hct 24, repate 19.8.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and there is an unclear etiology. The patient is at risk for torsades de pointes due to electrolyte abnormalities and proarrhythmic medications.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to infectious etiology, blood loss, or cardiac failure. The patient's hemoglobin is dropping, and abdominal exam shows increased distension and tenderness.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The patient has a reduced ejection fraction and may be at risk for volume overload.
4. Bleeding: The patient is actively bleeding, likely into the abdomen, and may require surgery.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the cardiac arrest, hypotension, and respiratory failure.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has a distended abdomen and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and the patient may be at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient may be at risk for bleeding complications.
10. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and the patient may be at risk for malnutrition and related complications.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor the patient closely and manage the patient's care aggressively to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transfered from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, intitially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after intubation for respiratory distress from
   pulmonary edema, resolved, now re-admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after pulsless
   VT/VF arrest.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus ryhthm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Rpt EKG now shows no evidence of new ischemia
   -- cycle enzymes, ROMI (expect some elevations given chest
   compressions)
   -- cardiology consult re: heparinization and further w/u
   -- cardiac monitoring, keep [**Hospital1 **] pads on
   -- continue medical management with ASA daily. Of note, received
   metoprolol and valsartan this AM, but will hold for now given
   borderline BPs. Would restart if BPs stable
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Resp Failure: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Prior to today, the most recent respiratory distress was
   [**2-13**] flash pulmonary edema, but this is not evident on post-intubation
   CXR. She had no fever or secretions to suggest new PNA, although her
   WBC count remains elevated. CXR without new infiltrate. Her agonal
   respirations could have simply been due to associated resolved VT/VF
   arrest and shock - doubt there is a primary respiratory failure.
   -- ABG shows good oxygenation, now switched over to PSV. Wean to [**5-16**]
   today with goal of extubation in next 24 hours
   -- received about 1-1.5 liters peri-code. Would diurese with goal -1L
   today
   -- have nitro gtt available for extubation, keep BPs <150
   -- nebs standing and prn
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with ASA, statin, hold BB and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   .
   # CHF - The patient was noted on Echo to have both systolic and
   diastolic CHF.
   -- fluid management as above, would diurese with lasix for goal -1L
   today
   -- holding [**Last Name (un) 284**] and BB for the moment, restart post extubation when BPs
   are stable
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Surgery has been following with no
   specific recommendations. Per them, the patient is to remain NPO, but
   may have tube feeds via J-tube.
   -- continue on cefepime, fluconazole
   -- hold TFs for now peri-extubation
   .
   # S/p gastrectomy:
   -- J-tube and tube feeds
   -- Pain meds prn
   .
   # Benign HTN:
   -- holding metoprolol and diovan
   .
   # DVT Prophylaxis: heparin subcutaneous
   .
   #) FEN:
   -- hold TFs for now, is to remain NPO
   -- repelte lytes to K 4.0, Mg 2.0 given concern for cardiac status
   .
   # Access
   -- has femoral line placed in code, will re-site to IJ

   return of patient to [**Hospital3 4838**]. Consider giving anxiolytics
   for the ambulance ride to decrease anxiety. Make sure blood pressure is
   controlled to prevent flash pulmonary edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema, which resolved. She was later readmitted to the ICU after a pulseless VT/VF arrest.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing bleeding from a splenic hematoma, requiring multiple units of blood transfusions. She has also been diagnosed with probable CAD, CHF, and anastomotic leak.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Continued bleeding from the splenic hematoma, which can lead to further blood loss and organ failure.
2. Development of cardiac arrhythmias or ischemic events due to CAD, which can be exacerbated by the patient's ongoing bleeding and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Progression of CHF, leading to further fluid overload and respiratory failure.
4. Anastomotic leak, which can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and organ failure.
5. Development of DVT or PE due to immobility and prolonged hospitalization.
6. Respiratory failure due to ongoing bleeding, cardiac dysfunction, or anastomotic leak.
7. Sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing bleeding, anastomotic leak, or other underlying infections.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Ongoing blood transfusions to correct anemia and bleeding.
2. Cardiac monitoring and management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic events.
3. Fluid management to prevent fluid overload and CHF.
4. Anastomotic leak management, including tube feeds and antibiotics.
5. DVT prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneous injections.
6. Respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
7. Pain management with analgesics and anxiolytics.

The patient's disposition is currently ICU care, with plans for transfer to the floor when stable. However, due to her ongoing critical condition, she will require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration: s/p embolization by IR with recently
   stable Hcts. Patient had known old splenic laceration, but reason for
   re-bleed is unclear.  It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated
   by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest,
   suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q4H
   -- Monitor vitals closely
   -- Transfuse for any drop in Hct
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus rhythm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Repeat EKG this a.m.
   -- Repeat echo
   -- Cycle enzymes
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- holding metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- echocardiogram to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic
   significance.
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently the patient is at high risk of aspiration given
   secretions in esophagus and requires airway protection.
   -- Most recent ABG shows good oxygenation and ventilation. Continue
   current vent settings
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with statin.
   -- Hold ASA, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- f/u cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   -- repeat echo as above
   .
   # CHF: No role for diuresis in setting of recent massive bleeding.
   .
   # Tachycardia: DDx includes hypovolemia ([**2-13**] hemorrhage), pain, sepsis.
   -- pull central venous line placed at outside hospital
   -- treat pain adequately
   -- low threshold for blood transfusion
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely [**2-13**] hypoperfusion in the setting of
   cardiac arrest and hemorrhage from splenic lac.
   -- monitor urine output and BP
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Prior to the patient
s recent
   bleeding, the plan was for the patient to remain NPO, with feeds via
   J-tube. Currently patient has massively distended abdomen and fluid in
   esophagus.
   -- d/c antibiotics
   -- hold TFs given massive abdominal distending and fluid in esophagus
   .
   # S/p gastrectomy:
   -- holding tube feeds
   -- Pain meds prn
   -- f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Benign HTN:
   -- holding metoprolol and diovan
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: holding tube feeds, replete lytes aggressively to maintain
   K>4.0, Mg>2.0
   Glycemic Control:
   Lines:  Femoral line placed during code + new IJ; femoral line will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after suffering a pulseless VT/VF arrest, followed by a diagnosis of splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. The patient has a history of gastric cancer, and the reason for the re-bleed is unclear.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.7°C, HR 109 bpm, BP 109/62 mmHg, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving multiple units of blood and platelets, and her HCT has stabilized at 33%.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 6,260 mL of IV fluids and has a total fluid output of 567 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and her ECG shows sinus rhythm. She is receiving medications to manage her cardiac condition.
* Abdominal status: The patient has a tense and distended abdomen with a midline incision and a JP drain in place. She has a J-tube in place for nutrition.
* Extremities: The patient has clean dressings in place over her right femoral artery puncture site and left femoral central venous line.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Continued bleeding from the splenic laceration
* Development of acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia and cardiac arrest
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, ischemia, and infarction
* Sepsis due to infection and hypoperfusion
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to fluid overload and lung injury
* Gastrointestinal complications such as anastomotic leak and abdominal distension
* Neurological complications such as stroke and seizures due to hypoperfusion and cardiac arrest

The patient's care plan includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance
* Administration of medications to manage cardiac and respiratory status
* Maintenance of adequate nutrition and hydration
* Monitoring of abdominal and extremity status
* Prevention of complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Communication with the family and patient regarding the patient's condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration: s/p embolization by IR with recently
   stable Hcts. Patient had known old splenic laceration, but reason for
   re-bleed is unclear.  It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated
   by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest,
   suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q4H
   -- Monitor vitals closely
   -- Transfuse for any drop in Hct
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus rhythm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Repeat EKG this a.m.
   -- Repeat echo
   -- Cycle enzymes
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- holding metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- echocardiogram to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic
   significance.
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently the patient is at high risk of aspiration given
   secretions in esophagus and requires airway protection.
   -- Most recent ABG shows good oxygenation and ventilation. Continue
   current vent settings
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with statin.
   -- Hold ASA, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- f/u cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   -- repeat echo as above
   .
   # CHF: No role for diuresis in setting of recent massive bleeding.
   .
   # Tachycardia: DDx includes hypovolemia ([**2-13**] hemorrhage), pain, sepsis.
   -- pull central venous line placed at outside hospital
   -- treat pain adequately
   -- low threshold for blood transfusion
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Prior to the patient
s recent
   bleeding, the plan was for the patient to remain NPO, with feeds via
   J-tube. Currently patient has massively distended abdomen and fluid in
   esophagus.
   -- d/c antibiotics
   -- hold TFs given massive abdominal distending and fluid in esophagus
   .
   # S/p gastrectomy:
   -- holding tube feeds
   -- Pain meds prn
   -- f/u surgery recs

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless VT/VF arrest. She had recently undergone gastric cancer resection and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient was diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. She has a history of cardiac arrest, and an echocardiogram revealed LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and risk of aspiration.

Medical Complications:

1. Splenic laceration: The patient has a splenic laceration that requires ongoing transfusion and monitoring. The reason for the re-bleed is unclear, but it may be related to CPR or pre-existing abdominal pain.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a pulseless VT/VF arrest, and an echocardiogram revealed LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. This may be an ischemic event.
3. Pericardial effusion: A CT chest revealed a pericardial effusion, which requires further evaluation and management.
4. Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: The patient is at high risk of aspiration due to secretions in the esophagus and requires airway protection.
5. Probable CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and medical management with a statin is recommended.
6. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, but diuresis is not indicated in the setting of recent massive bleeding.
7. Tachycardia: The patient has a tachycardia that may be due to hypovolemia, pain, or sepsis.
8. Anastamotic leak: The patient has an anastamotic leak s/p stenting, which requires further management.
9. S/p gastrectomy: The patient has a history of gastrectomy, and tube feeds are being held.
10. Benign HTN: The patient has a history of benign HTN, and medications such as metoprolol and diovan are being held.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs closely and transfuse as needed.
2. Repeat EKG and echo to further evaluate cardiac function.
3. Cycle enzymes to monitor for cardiac damage.
4. F/u cardiology recommendations.
5. Hold ASA, BB, and other medications as previously mentioned.
6. Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfuse as needed.
7. Continue mechanical ventilation and airway protection.
8. F/u surgery recommendations.
9. Replete electrolytes aggressively to maintain K>4.0 and Mg>2.0.
10. Consider placing peripherals and removing the femoral line."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 SPLENIC HEMORRHAGE:  Now s/p emoblization by IR, serial hcts this
   morning have been stable, last transfused around [**2-14**] am.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to massive abdominal hemorrhage,
   hypotension, poor renal perfusion.  Making urine this am following
   aggressive volume resusitation with blood products and IV NS.  Cr
   slightly increased this morning. Anuric overnight up to 7 am, now
   making urine.
 CARDIAC ARREST:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been triggered by acute hemorrhage,
   possible ischemia in that setting, cardiac enzymes have been flat.
   Repeat ECG this morning.  ASA on hold.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Remains intubated and
   sedated in setting of abdominal bleed.  Now component of volume
   overload.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress related in setting of acute events, was
   pancultured.  Will not broaden antibacterial/antifungal therapy at this
   point albeit can reconsider if she is at all hemodynamically unstable.
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN:  Holding antihypertenisve.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient appears to be volume-overloaded
   and would likely not tolerate extubation without further diruesis.
   -- Diurese with goal net negative 1L today
   -- Continue mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct generally
   stable although slowly trending down.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q6H
   -- Transfuse for Hct<30
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events
   -- Cardiac enzymes unchanged
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- restart metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- Echocardiogram shows fat pad but not effusion
   .
   # CHF: Volume overload
   -- Diurese slowly with goal net negative 1 L today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 22.2.  Could be reaction to acute stress of
   bleed, but also concerning for infection. Have already pulled femoral
   line placed during code.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female admitted to the ICU after a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, resection, and subsequent complications. She has been intubated five times due to respiratory failure, hematemesis, and cardiac arrest. She has a splenic artery laceration requiring embolization, and her hemoglobin levels are trending down. She has also experienced cardiac arrest, probable CAD, and is at risk for an ischemic event. She has a pericardial effusion, CHF, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and anastamotic leak following gastrectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk for further respiratory distress or failure.
2. Splenic artery laceration: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, and she may require further transfusions to maintain a stable hemoglobin level.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is concerning, and she is at risk for further cardiac events, including ischemic events.
4. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion is a concern, and she may require further evaluation and management.
5. CHF: The patient's CHF is a concern, and she may require further diuresis and management to alleviate volume overload.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a reaction to acute stress or a sign of infection, and further evaluation and management are necessary.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a concern, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and potential treatment options.
8. Anastamotic leak: The patient's anastamotic leak following gastrectomy is a concern, and further evaluation and management are necessary to ensure proper healing and prevent further complications.
9. HTN: The patient's HTN is a concern, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and potential treatment options.
10. Breast CA: The patient's history of breast CA is a concern, and further evaluation and management are necessary to ensure proper treatment and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration: s/p embolization by IR with recently
   stable Hcts. Patient had known old splenic laceration, but reason for
   re-bleed is unclear.  It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated
   by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest,
   suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q4H
   -- Monitor vitals closely
   -- Transfuse for any drop in Hct
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus rhythm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Repeat EKG this a.m.
   -- Repeat echo
   -- Cycle enzymes
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- holding metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- echocardiogram to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic
   significance.
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently the patient is at high risk of aspiration given
   secretions in esophagus and requires airway protection.
   -- Most recent ABG shows good oxygenation and ventilation. Continue
   current vent settings
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with statin.
   -- Hold ASA, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- f/u cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   -- repeat echo as above
   .
   # CHF: No role for diuresis in setting of recent massive bleeding.
   .
   # Tachycardia: DDx includes hypovolemia ([**2-13**] hemorrhage), pain, sepsis.
   -- pull central venous line placed at outside hospital
   -- treat pain adequately
   -- low threshold for blood transfusion
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely [**2-13**] hypoperfusion in the setting of
   cardiac arrest and hemorrhage from splenic lac.
   -- monitor urine output and BP
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Prior to the patient
s recent
   bleeding, the plan was for the patient to remain NPO, with feeds via
   J-tube. Currently patient has massively distended abdomen and fluid in
   esophagus.
   -- d/c antibiotics
   -- hold TFs given massive abdominal distending and fluid in esophagus
   .
   # S/p gastrectomy:
   -- holding tube feeds
   -- Pain meds prn
   -- f/u surgery recs
   .
   # Benign HTN:
   -- holding metoprolol and diovan
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: holding tube feeds, replete lytes aggressively to maintain
   K>4.0, Mg>2.0

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications related to her gastric cancer diagnosis, including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of old splenic laceration, which was recently exacerbated by a pulseless VT/VF arrest and required massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic (102 bpm), hypotensive (129/68 mmHg), and hypoxemic (97% SpO2)
* Respiratory status: Intubated and mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous line and arterial line in place
* Fluid balance: Total input of 5,534 mL, total output of 499 mL, with a balance of 5,035 mL
* Laboratory results: Hemoglobin (Hb) 10.8 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) 34%, platelet count (Plt) 224,000/μL, white blood cell count (WBC) 17.6, and creatinine (Cr) 1.4 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Splenic artery laceration: The patient has a history of old splenic laceration, which was recently exacerbated by a pulseless VT/VF arrest and required massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. The patient's Hct is currently 34%, which is within the normal range.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which was treated with CPR and defibrillation. The patient's EKG shows sinus rhythm, and the patient is being monitored for signs of cardiac instability.
3. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which was detected on CT chest. The patient's EKG shows sinus rhythm, and the patient is being monitored for signs of cardiac instability.
4. Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, which is necessary to protect the patient's airway due to the risk of aspiration.
5. Probable CAD: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, and the patient's EKG shows signs of cardiac disease. The patient is being monitored for signs of cardiac instability.
6. CHF: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, and the patient's EKG shows signs of cardiac disease. The patient is being monitored for signs of cardiac instability.
7. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is currently 102 bpm, which is above the normal range. The patient's tachycardia may be due to hypovolemia, pain, or sepsis.
8. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is currently 1.4 mg/dL, which is above the normal range. The patient's acute renal failure may be due to hypoperfusion in the setting of cardiac arrest and hemorrhage from splenic lac.
9. Anastamotic leak: The patient has a history of gastrectomy and stenting, and the patient's current condition may be related to an anastamotic leak.
10. S/p gastrectomy: The patient has a history of gastrectomy and is currently receiving nutrition via J-tube.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and hemodynamic status closely.
* Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed.
* Transfuse for any drop in Hct.
* Maintain K>4.0, Mg>2.0, and Ca++>8.0 mg/dL.
* Hold ASA, BB, and [Last Name (un) 284] as above.
* F/u cards c/s.
* Cycle enyzmes as above.
* Serial EKGs.
* Repeat echo as above.
* Monitor urine output and BP.
* Maintain renal perfusion.
* D/c antibiotics.
* Hold TFs given massive abdominal distending and fluid in esophagus.
* F/u surgery recs.
* Hold metoprolol and diovan.
* Continue to replete lytes aggressively to maintain K>4.0, Mg>2.0.
* Continue to monitor the patient's airway and respiratory status closely.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal status closely.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function closely.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration: s/p embolization by IR with recently
   stable Hcts. Patient had known old splenic laceration, but reason for
   re-bleed is unclear.  It is possible that the bleeding was exacerbated
   by CPR, but the patient had abdominal pain prior to her arrest,
   suggesting that the bleed could have begun before the arrest.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q4H
   -- Monitor vitals closely
   -- Transfuse for any drop in Hct
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest -- now with return to sinus rhythm. No known
   cardiac history but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there
   is concern for an ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Repeat EKG this a.m.
   -- Repeat echo
   -- Cycle enzymes
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- holding metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- echocardiogram to further characterize and evaluate hemodynamic
   significance.
   .
   # Mechanical ventilation/Airway protection: Pt has now been intubated 5
   times (1) hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory
   distress following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently the patient is at high risk of aspiration given
   secretions in esophagus and requires airway protection.
   -- Most recent ABG shows good oxygenation and ventilation. Continue
   current vent settings
   .
   # Probable CAD
   [**Hospital **] medical management with statin.
   -- Hold ASA, BB, and [**Last Name (un) 284**] as above
   -- f/u cards c/s
   -- cycle enyzmes as above
   -- serial EKGs
   -- repeat echo as above
   .
   # CHF: No role for diuresis in setting of recent massive bleeding.
   .
   # Tachycardia: DDx includes hypovolemia ([**2-13**] hemorrhage), pain, sepsis.
   -- pull central venous line placed at outside hospital
   -- treat pain adequately
   -- low threshold for blood transfusion
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely [**2-13**] hypoperfusion in the setting of
   cardiac arrest and hemorrhage from splenic lac.
   -- monitor urine output and BP
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # Anastamotic leak: s/p stenting. Prior to the patient
s recent
   bleeding, the plan was for the patient to remain NPO, with feeds via
   J-tube. Currently patient has massively distended abdomen and fluid in
   esophagus.
   -- d/c antibiotics
   -- hold TFs given massive abdominal distending and fluid in esophagus
   .
   # S/p gastrectomy:
   -- holding tube feeds
   -- Pain meds prn
   -- f/u surgery recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. She had a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer and underwent resection. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for esophageal stenting. 

The patient suffered a pulseless VT/VF arrest and was diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. She had a known old splenic laceration, but the reason for re-bleed is unclear. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 129/68 mmHg, with a heart rate of 102 bpm. She is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.8 g/dL, platelet count is 184 K/uL, and white blood cell count is 17.6 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is 0.03 ng/mL.
* Physical examination: The patient is intubated and sedated, with a tense and distended abdomen. She has a midline incision and a JP drain in place.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a history of recent surgery and bleeding.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a history of cardiac arrest and hemorrhage.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, and she has a history of cardiac arrest and LV systolic dysfunction.
* Pulmonary complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and she has a history of pulmonary edema.
* Abdominal complications: The patient has a tense and distended abdomen, and she has a history of recent surgery and bleeding.
* Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a history of massive bleeding from a splenic laceration, and she may be at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring her hemodynamic status closely and transfusing blood products as needed.
* Maintaining active warming with multiple units crossed.
* Repeat EKG and echo studies to further evaluate her cardiac status.
* Serial ABG studies to monitor her respiratory status.
* Monitoring her urine output and blood pressure to assess her renal function.
* Maintaining a low threshold for blood transfusion.
* Holding antibiotics and tube feeds due to the patient's abdominal distension and fluid in the esophagus.
* F/u with cardiology and surgery regarding the patient's cardiac and abdominal status."

   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):
   Splenic hemorrhage s/p IR intervention.  Last transfused last night.
   Hct stable today, BP stable.  Following serial CBCs.
 HYPOVOLEMIA (VOLUME DEPLETION - WITHOUT SHOCK): Secondary to
   hemorrhage as above. Has been intravascularly volume repleted with
   blood products.
 CARDIAC ARREST:  PVCs on the monitor. Following electrolytes and
   repleting as needed.  Restart beta blocker.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): Still component of volume
   overload.  Now that she is hemodaynamically stable will diurese.
   Lighten sedation.  Continue PSV.  Will reassess this afternoon
   regarding possibility of extubation.
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Main factor limiting her from coming off
   the vent.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress related in setting of massive hemorrhage
   but also need to consider infection.  Will send blood, urine cultures.
   If this continues to increase and she has fevers consider abdominal CT
   scan as the splen bleed/thrombus may become infected. Continue current
   antibiotics/antifungal therapy.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased, probable ATN secondary to bleed,
   hypotension, hypoperfusion and she did received some contrast in IR.
   Examine urine sediment, urine lytes prior to lasix, check bladder
   pressure.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Repeat labs this afternoon, consider free water
   replacement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): Still component of volume
   overload.  Now that she is hemodaynamically stable will diurese.
   Lighten sedation.  Continue PSV.  Will reassess this afternoon
   regarding possibility of extubation.
 CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Main factor limiting her from coming off
   the vent.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  [**Month (only) 11**] be stress related in setting of massive hemorrhage
   but also need to consider infection.  Will send blood, urine cultures.
   If this continues to increase and she has fevers consider abdominal CT
   scan as the splen bleed/thrombus may become infected. Continue current
   antibiotics/antifungal therapy.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr increased, probable ATN secondary to bleed,
   hypotension, hypoperfusion and she did received some contrast in IR.
   Examine urine sediment, urine lytes prior to lasix, check bladder
   pressure.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Repeat labs this afternoon, consider free water
   replacement.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and splenic hemorrhage. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/67 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypovolemia, and acute renal failure, as well as elevated liver enzymes and troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mechanical ventilation is not optimized, or if there is a delay in weaning from the ventilator.
2. Splenic Hemorrhage: The patient's splenic hemorrhage may continue to bleed, leading to further blood loss and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if further blood loss occurs, or if there is a delay in transfusing additional blood products.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure may worsen if not managed with diuretics and other medications.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to neurological complications if not managed with free water replacement.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the splenic hemorrhage and the presence of foreign bodies, such as the endotracheal tube and arterial line.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications early.
2. Optimize the mechanical ventilation settings to ensure the patient is receiving the best possible respiratory support.
3. Manage the patient's anemia with blood transfusions as needed, and consider other treatments such as erythropoietin.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with diuretics and other medications, and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider sending blood and urine cultures to rule out infection.
6. Manage the patient's hypernatremia with free water replacement and consider other treatments such as diuretics.
7. Consider antibiotics and antifungal therapy to prevent and treat infection, and consider abdominal CT scan if the patient develops signs of infection.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider medications such as beta blockers to manage hypertension and tachycardia."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient appears to be volume-overloaded
   and would likely not tolerate extubation without further diruesis.
   -- Diurese with goal net negative 1L today
   -- Continue mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct generally
   stable although slowly trending down.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q6H
   -- Transfuse for Hct<30
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events
   -- Cardiac enzymes unchanged
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- restart metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- Echocardiogram shows fat pad but not effusion
   .
   # CHF: Volume overload
   -- Diurese slowly with goal net negative 1 L today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 22.2.  Could be reaction to acute stress of
   bleed, but also concerning for infection. Have already pulled femoral
   line placed during code.
   -- pan culture
   -- check differential
 shows 88 neutrophils and 5 bands
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN,
   obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- check bladder pressure
   -- renal U/S
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Followed by surgery and GI
   -- restart tube feeding via J-tube
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- restart metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a complex medical history, including gastric cancer, recent splenic laceration, and cardiac arrest. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient is also experiencing volume overload, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's continued need for mechanical ventilation and potential for respiratory distress or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and potential for infection, particularly in the setting of a recent splenic laceration and cardiac arrest.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure and potential for further deterioration in kidney function.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and potential for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrectomy and anastomotic leak, with potential for further complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential for further hemorrhage, as well as her history of cardiac arrest and potential for further cardiac complications.
7. Infection: The patient's potential for infection, particularly in the setting of a recent splenic laceration and cardiac arrest.
8. Fluid overload: The patient's ongoing fluid overload and potential for further fluid accumulation, which could exacerbate her respiratory and cardiovascular instability.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation: To support the patient's respiratory function and prevent further respiratory distress.
2. Diuresis: To manage the patient's volume overload and prevent further fluid accumulation.
3. Antibiotics: To prevent and treat potential infections, particularly in the setting of a recent splenic laceration and cardiac arrest.
4. Cardiovascular medications: To manage the patient's cardiovascular instability and prevent further cardiac complications.
5. Pain management: To manage the patient's pain and discomfort, particularly in the setting of her recent surgical procedures.
6. Nutrition: To provide the patient with adequate nutrition and hydration, particularly in the setting of her ongoing bleeding and potential for further fluid loss.

The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient continues to be volume-overloaded
   on physical exam and CXR and would likely not tolerate extubation
   without further diruesis.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 2L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears stable
   at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- Check Hct Q8H
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Found on CT chest. Patient is s/p CPR.
   -- Echocardiogram shows fat pad but not effusion
   .
   # CHF: Volume overload
   -- Diurese slowly with goal net negative 2L today
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC stable at 21.6 today.  Latest differential from
   yesterday  shows 88 neutrophils and 5 bands.  The patient continues to
   be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious process, although
   abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN,
   obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome.  Kidney U/S
   unremarkable.
   -- Send urine Eos
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- continuing to check bladder pressures
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds yesterday.
   -- Add IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- hold tube feeding for now
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex

 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):  Hct
   has stablized following IR intervention to splenic artery.  Bladder
   pressures elevated overnight, now down to 18.  Appreciate surgical
   evaluation overnight.  If hct decreases consider repeat abdominal CT
   and/or tagged RBC scan.  INR 1.5 today, will give vitamin K.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Continues to be volume
   overloaded, requires further diuresis.  Replete electrolytes as
   needed.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to hypoperfusion in setting of
   abdominal hemmorhage and dye load in IR procedure.  Renal US
   unremarkable.  Dosing meds accordingly.  Good reponse to lasix despite
   rising Cr.  Check urine eosinophils.
 CARDIAC:  Back on the beta blocker.  Repeat echo not significantly
   changed.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Continues with only low grade fevers.  Level stable to
   slightly down this morning.  No change in antibiotics/antifungal
   therapy at this time.  Low threshold to broaden if she is clinically
   unstable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pressures elevated overnight, now down to 18.  Appreciate surgical
   evaluation overnight.  If hct decreases consider repeat abdominal CT
   and/or tagged RBC scan.  INR 1.5 today, will give vitamin K.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Continues to be volume
   overloaded, requires further diuresis.  Replete electrolytes as
   needed.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to hypoperfusion in setting of
   abdominal hemmorhage and dye load in IR procedure.  Renal US
   unremarkable.  Dosing meds accordingly.  Good reponse to lasix despite
   rising Cr.  Check urine eosinophils.
 CARDIAC:  Back on the beta blocker.  Repeat echo not significantly
   changed.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Continues with only low grade fevers.  Level stable to
   slightly down this morning.  No change in antibiotics/antifungal
   therapy at this time.  Low threshold to broaden if she is clinically
   unstable.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a splenic hemorrhage and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and sedated, making it difficult to assess their history.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, coagulopathy, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and leukocytosis. The patient's condition is being managed with diuresis, antibiotics, and antifungal therapy.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 328 mL and a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is being maintained at 97% with an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a normal heart rhythm and blood pressure. The patient's abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with tenderness and grimacing with palpation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, with an ALT of 13 IU/L and an AST of 13 IU/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and an electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and the healthcare team is working to optimize their care. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen if they continue to bleed or if their bone marrow is unable to produce enough red blood cells.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if they develop pneumonia or if their mechanical ventilation is not optimized.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if they continue to experience hypoperfusion or if their underlying kidney disease is not addressed.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis can worsen if they develop an infection or if their underlying condition is not managed effectively.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular status can worsen if they develop cardiac arrhythmias or if their blood pressure is not well-controlled.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with a splenic hemorrhage and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is being managed with diuresis, antibiotics, and antifungal therapy, and their respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and impaired renal function, and their condition is being closely monitored. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of anemia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, and cardiovascular instability."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 year old female with recently diagnosed gastric CA, s/p resection,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then
   extubated and called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p
   pulseless VT/VF arrest, then diagnosed with splenic laceration
   requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, the patient continues to be volume-overloaded
   on physical exam and CXR and would likely not tolerate extubation
   without further diruesis.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 2L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric cancer, who was initially admitted for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. She was extubated and transferred to the medical floor, but was readmitted to the ICU after a pulseless VT/VF arrest and diagnosis of a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. She has a history of cardiac arrest and is being monitored on telemetry for frequent ectopy. She also has a pericardial effusion, volume overload, and acute renal failure. She has leukocytosis and is being treated for suspected anastamotic leak after gastrectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to continued volume overload and the need for further diuresis.
2. Splenic artery laceration: The patient's Hct may continue to trend down, requiring further transfusions and monitoring.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac history and recent cardiac arrest increase the risk of future cardiac events.
4. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion may worsen, requiring further evaluation and management.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
6. Anastamotic leak: The patient's anastamotic leak may worsen, requiring further surgical intervention.
7. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload may lead to further respiratory distress and cardiac compromise.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate a underlying infection, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
9. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may worsen, requiring further potassium supplementation.
10. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's hypomagnesemia may worsen, requiring further magnesium supplementation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis to manage volume overload and respiratory failure.
2. Monitor the patient's Hct and transfuse as needed to maintain a stable hematocrit.
3. Continue cardiac monitoring and treatment for cardiac arrest.
4. Evaluate the patient's pericardial effusion further and consider echocardiogram or CT chest.
5. Manage the patient's acute renal failure with fluid restriction and diuretics.
6. Continue antibiotics for suspected anastamotic leak and consider adding gram-positive coverage pending culture results.
7. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation for underlying infection.
8. Replete potassium and magnesium levels as needed to maintain normal levels.
9. Continue pain management and consider further evaluation for underlying causes of pain.
10. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further evaluation for cardiac disease."

   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, pt is 2 L negative O/N with marked improvement
   in exam and CXR (improvement of b/l LE and UE (hand) edema and
   relatively clear respiratory exam)
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)

   5. Leukocytosis: WBC improved to 19.0 from 21.6 .  The patient
   continues to be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious
   process, although abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, obstruction, intraabdominal
   compartment syndrome.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.
   -- Send urine Eos

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She has a complex medical history, including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, pulseless VT/VF arrest, splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

Current conditions:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. She has had five previous episodes of intubation due to hematemesis, respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest. The current assessment is that she is improving, with marked improvement in her exam and CXR.
2. Splenic artery laceration: The patient had embolization by interventional radiology, and her Hct appears stable. She requires ongoing transfusions and monitoring of her Hct.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit, which is being treated with 1L D5W maintenance.
4. Probable CAD: The patient had an echo with LV systolic dysfunction, suggesting CAD. She requires ongoing monitoring on telemetry and may require further cardiac evaluation.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC has improved, but she still has a high WBC count. She is being monitored for signs of infection and may require further antibiotics.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has a differential diagnosis of ATN, obstruction, and intraabdominal compartment syndrome. She requires ongoing monitoring of her urine output and renal perfusion.
7. Anastamotic leak: The patient had a gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak, which is being managed with tube feeds and IV Reglan.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress or cardiac arrest if her ventilation is not optimized.
2. Splenic artery laceration: The patient may experience further bleeding or splenic rupture if her Hct is not maintained.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient may experience further electrolyte imbalances if her free water deficit is not addressed.
4. Probable CAD: The patient may experience further cardiac events if her CAD is not managed properly.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient may experience further signs of infection or sepsis if her WBC count is not managed properly.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient may experience further kidney damage or failure if her renal perfusion is not maintained.
7. Anastamotic leak: The patient may experience further complications from her gastrectomy, including infection or bleeding.

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Diuresis with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today.
2. Checking lytes tid and repleting for K>4, Mg>2.
3. Continuing mechanical ventilation and trying PS 5/5.
4. Weaning sedation (propofol).
5. Monitoring Hct and transfusing as needed.
6. Maintaining active T+S with multiple units crossed.
7. Considering repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down.
8. Monitoring on telemetry and considering further cardiac evaluation.
9. Continuing antibiotics and considering adding gram-positive coverage.
10. Monitoring urine output and renal perfusion.
11. Maintaining renal perfusion and checking bladder pressures.
12. Adding IV Reglan for vomiting and holding tube feeds for now.
13. F/u GI and surgery recommendations.
14. Continuing metoprolol and holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding.
15. Continuing Arimidex.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing monitoring and management of her complex medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 67 kg male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and subsequent splenectomy. He has been receiving antibiotics for an anastomosis leak and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. His laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte imbalances. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter and arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anastomosis leak: The patient's anastomosis leak is a significant concern, as it can lead to further bleeding, infection, and organ damage. Close monitoring of his surgical site and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular ectopy increases his risk of further cardiac events. Continuous cardiac monitoring and management of his cardiac rhythm are essential.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia or atelectasis, requires close monitoring and management. Mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy may be necessary to support his respiratory function.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may be secondary to hypovolemia, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications. Close monitoring of his renal function and management of his fluid status are crucial.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which requires prompt recognition and management.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to blood loss, hemolysis, or bone marrow suppression. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin levels and transfusion therapy may be necessary.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and splenectomy increases his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation. Close monitoring of his abdominal status and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate is 83 beats per minute, blood pressure is 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and bladder pressure is 18 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 801 mL of fluid and has lost 2,760 mL of fluid through urine and other means, resulting in a net loss of 1,959 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) through an endotracheal tube, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 9.2 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count is 21.6, platelet (Plt) count is 183, and lactate level is 0.8 mmol/L.
* Physical examination: The patient is intubated, sedated, and non-responsive. The neck is rigid, and the lungs are clear anteriorly. The abdomen is distended, and there is trace edema in the extremities.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's low-grade fever and elevated WBC count may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's ventricular ectopy and cardiac arrest may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed with adequate respiratory support and treatment of underlying causes.
* Anastomosis leak: The patient's anastomosis leak may lead to further complications, such as bleeding, infection, or bowel obstruction, if not treated promptly.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated with blood transfusions or other supportive measures.
* Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF may worsen if not managed with adequate fluid resuscitation and treatment of underlying causes.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely and to adjust treatment plans accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, anemia, and respiratory failure, and is currently being treated for anastomosis leak, pneumonia, and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 21.6 x 10^9/L, and the patient's platelet count is 183 x 10^9/L.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 384 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a cardiac output of 7 L/min. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin-T level of 0.03 ng/mL.

The patient's nutritional status is stable, with a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) infusion of 681 mL and an oral intake of 361 mL.

The patient's glycemic control is stable, with a glucose level of 84 mg/dL.

The patient's prophylactic measures include lovenox for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and midazolam for sedation.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the patient is currently being treated in the ICU with a plan to screen for long-term acute care (LTAC) placement.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient may still be at risk for respiratory failure if the patient's underlying condition worsens.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the patient may still be at risk for cardiac arrest if the patient's underlying condition worsens.
4. Anastomosis leak: The patient's anastomosis leak may lead to further complications, such as peritonitis or abscess formation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Currently, pt is 2 L negative O/N with marked improvement
   in exam and CXR (improvement of b/l LE and UE (hand) edema and
   relatively clear respiratory exam)
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- can start checking HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- due to free water deficit. Will give 1L D5W
   maintenance
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: frequent ectopy but no other events, if ectopy
   give metoprolol IV.
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC improved to 19.0 from 21.6 .  The patient
   continues to be afebrile with no localized evidence of infectious
   process, although abdomen is the most likely source.
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), consider adding
   gram positive coverage pending culture results
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, obstruction, intraabdominal
   compartment syndrome.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.
   -- Send urine Eos
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   -- continuing to check bladder pressures
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications related to gastric adenocarcinoma, including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, splenic laceration, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no ectopy on telemetry, and hypernatremia has improved with the administration of D5W. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory exam is relatively clear.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 19.0
* Hct: 27.6
* Plt: 202
* Cr: 1.7
* TCO2: 25
* Glucose: 79
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 14.8/36.0/1.3, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 54/3/0.03, ALT / AST: 13/13, Alk Phos / T Bili: 107/0.8, Differential-Neuts: 88.0%, Band: 5.0%, Lymph: 4.0%, Mono: 2.0%, Eos: 1.0%, Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.4 g/dL, LDH: 349 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The plan is to diurese with a goal of net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today, check electrolytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg>2, and continue mechanical ventilation.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient has undergone splenic artery embolization. The plan is to follow up with IR and surgery recommendations, transfuse for Hct<26, maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed, and consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down.
* Hypernatremia: The patient has been given 1L D5W maintenance.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of probable CAD. The plan is to monitor on telemetry, give metoprolol IV if ectopy occurs, follow up with cardiology recommendations, hold ASA, and maintain K>4, Mg>2.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC has improved to 19.0 from 21.6. The plan is to follow up with blood and urine cultures, continue antibiotics, consider adding gram-positive coverage pending culture results, and hold off on CT a/p for now.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has a differential diagnosis of ATN from hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome. The plan is to send urine Eos, monitor urine output, maintain renal perfusion, and continue to check bladder pressures.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition (NPO, hold tube feeds, replete lytes aggressively to maintain K>4.0, Mg>2.0 consider TPN), glycemic control (insulin SC), lines (interval jugular CVL), prophylaxis (DVT: pneumoboots, stress ulcer: pantoprazole, VAP), and comments (communication: family, code status: DNR, disposition: ICU).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory exam is relatively clear, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying medical conditions.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient may still be at risk for bleeding or other complications related to her splenic artery laceration.
* Hypernatremia: The patient may still be at risk for further electrolyte imbalances or other complications related to her hypernatremia.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of probable CAD and may still be at risk for cardiac arrest or other cardiac complications.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC has improved, but she may still be at risk for infection or other complications related to her leukocytosis.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has a differential diagnosis of ATN from hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, obstruction, intraabdominal compartment syndrome, and may still be at risk for further complications related to her acute renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol, increase dosing to tid
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern for new
   infiltrates on CXR.  Low grade fevers.
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), low threshold to
   add gram positive coverage and additional Pseudomonal coverage
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving,
   intraabd. Compartment syndrome unlikely.  Renal function improving
   slightly today.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- consider re-start tube feeding today
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol, increase dosing to tid
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern for new
   infiltrates on CXR.  Low grade fevers.
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), low threshold to
   add gram positive coverage and additional Pseudomonal coverage
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving,
   intraabd. Compartment syndrome unlikely.  Renal function improving
   slightly today.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory status has improved slightly, but a new infiltrate is noted on her chest X-ray.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of probable CAD, and her cardiac arrest was likely due to an ischemic event. She is currently on telemetry and has no ectopy.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, which is improving slightly. The differential diagnosis includes ATN from hypoperfusion and contrast-induced nephropathy.
* Hematology: The patient has leukocytosis, which is trending down. She has a low-grade fever and concern for new infiltrates on CXR.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has anastomotic leak and has been experiencing episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but she is still at risk for dehydration.
* Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotensive episodes, which may have contributed to her acute renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 19.0, Hct 27.6, Plt 202
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 26 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 79 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 349 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care is as follows:

* Respiratory: Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5, and wean sedation.
* Cardiovascular: Monitor on telemetry, hold ASA, and continue metoprolol, atorvastatin, and other cardiac medications.
* Renal: Monitor urine output, maintain renal perfusion, and consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down.
* Hematology: Trend WBCs, fever curves, and continue antibiotics.
* Gastrointestinal: Continue IV Reglan for vomiting, consider re-start tube feeding, and f/u GI and surgery recs.
* Hypernatremia: Continue to monitor and replete lytes aggressively.
* Hypotension: Continue metoprolol and hold Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening of infiltrates on CXR
* Cardiac arrest due to continued ischemic event
* Acute renal failure due to ATN or contrast-induced nephropathy
* Leukocytosis and new infiltrates on CXR, which may indicate sepsis or infection
* Anastomotic leak and emesis, which may lead to further complications such as abscess or peritonitis
* Hypernatremia and dehydration, which may lead to further complications such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 66.7 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU due to cardiac arrest and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on antibiotics for suspected sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 152/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and the patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 19.0 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 26 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's intubation and sedation. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessable, and the patient's skin, neurologic, and abdominal examinations are not documented.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss from the spleen, with a plan to follow hemoglobin levels and transfuse as necessary.
* Fever, with a plan to continue antibiotics and await microbiology results.
* Cardiac arrest, with a plan to continue metoprolol and monitor for ventricular ectopy.
* Respiratory failure, with a plan to continue diuresis and monitor for improvement.
* Acute kidney injury, with a plan to continue monitoring and adjusting fluid management as necessary.
* Anastomosis leak, with a plan to continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
* Nutrition, with a plan to hold total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for now and reassess in the morning.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further monitoring and microbiology results are necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular ectopy make them at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications as necessary are important.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's continued need for mechanical ventilation and diuresis suggest that they are at risk for further respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory therapy as necessary are important.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid management and electrolyte levels as necessary are important.
* Anastomosis leak: The patient's anastomosis leak and continued need for antibiotics suggest the possibility of ongoing infection. Close monitoring and adjustment of antibiotics as necessary are important.
* Blood loss anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to blood loss from the spleen. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion as necessary are important."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition is stable, but there are concerns regarding potential complications.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, ventricular ectopy, and anemia secondary to blood loss from the spleen. The patient is receiving antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications to manage these conditions.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with worsening CXR infiltrates and increased secretions. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV and is being closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure.

The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 152/75 mmHg and a heart rate of 89 beats per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and evidence of blood loss. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is notable for distended abdomen, hypoactive bowel sounds, and trace edema in the extremities.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening CXR infiltrates and increased secretions increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's anemia and evidence of blood loss increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular ectopy increase the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Anastomosis leak: The patient's anastomosis leak increases the risk of complications such as infection and bleeding.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's distended abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis.

The patient's care plan should include close monitoring of their respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic status, as well as management of their anemia and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's antibiotic and antifungal therapy should be continued, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis. The patient's anastomosis leak should be managed with antibiotics and a stent, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall individual weighing 66.7 kg, admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. They are intubated, sedated, and non-responsive. The patient has a history of anemia, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and anastomosis leak. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: Tmax 100, Tcurrent 100, HR 89 bpm, BP 152/75 mmHg, RR 24 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 97%. The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV, and FiO2 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's radiology results show worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss from spleen: stable, follow Hct, JP output.
2. Fever: still present, concerned about new infiltrates on CXR, expand coverage to include vanco and consider broadening gram-negative coverage.
3. Cardiac arrest, ventricular ectopy: continue metoprolol.
4. Respiratory failure: did well with PSV 5/5 yesterday, but worsening CXR today, continue current settings.
5. ARF: stable.
6. Anastomosis leak: on abx, stent in place.
7. Nutrition: retry TFs.
8. ICU care: continue prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: due to fever, worsening infiltrates on CXR, and elevated white blood cell count.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: due to ventricular ectopy and cardiac arrest history.
3. Respiratory failure: due to worsening CXR and elevated lactate levels.
4. Anastomosis leak: due to the presence of anastomosis leak and stent in place.
5. Infection: due to anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and presence of central lines and drains.
6. Fluid imbalance: due to fluid balance data showing a negative balance of -1,207 mL.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: due to abnormal laboratory results, such as elevated potassium and magnesium levels.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology results to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has undergone surgery and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Anemia secondary to blood loss from the spleen: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.7 g/dL, which is low. The patient is being followed closely, and the hemoglobin level is being monitored.
2. Cardiac arrest with ventricular ectopy: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently being treated with metoprolol.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and diuresis is being continued.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is stable, and the patient is being monitored closely.
5. Anastomosis leak: The patient has an anastomosis leak, which is being treated with antibiotics. A stent is in place to help the patient recover.
6. Fever: The patient's fever has improved, and the patient is being treated with antibiotics pending microbiological evaluation.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 123 mg/dL, which is low. The patient is being monitored closely for hypoglycemic episodes.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is high, and the patient is being treated with correcting measures.

The patient has a complex medical condition, and the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the anastomosis leak and the presence of antibiotics.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular ectopy increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory distress.
4. Renal failure: The patient's ARF and the presence of diuretics increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's anastomosis leak and the presence of antibiotics increase the risk of infection.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypoglycemia and the presence of diuretics increase the risk of hypotension.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's electrolyte imbalance increases the risk of hyperkalemia.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall, 66.7 kg male with a history of cardiac arrest, anemia, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 393 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 152/75 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient has a history of bleeding, with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and is receiving blood transfusions. His platelet count is 202 K/uL, and his prothrombin time (PT) is 14.8 seconds.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and he is receiving hemodialysis. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and his lactate level is 0.8 mmol/L.

The patient's anastomosis leak is being treated with antibiotics, and he is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is slightly decreased, indicating a potential risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular ectopy may increase his risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may exacerbate his cardiac condition and increase his risk of bleeding.
5. AKI: The patient's AKI may progress to end-stage renal disease if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Anastomosis leak: The patient's anastomosis leak may lead to further bleeding and complications if not treated promptly.
7. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which may lead to sepsis and other complications.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Hold Lasix today in the setting of preparation for CT scan
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5
   -Pull back ETT tube
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue Metoprolol at tid dosing with holding parameters
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis, Fevers: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern
   for new febrile episodes.  No clear source of infection, likely
   abdominal source vs. VAP vs. line infection vs. thromboembolic event
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Sputum, Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue broad coverage with Cefepime, Fluconazole, Flagyl and
   Vancomycin for now pending culture data
   --CT chest / abdomen and pelvis with PO and IV contrast after
   pre-hydration, Mucomyst, bicarb to look for evidence of infection.
   --Needs PIV access for contrast injection
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   --F/u RUE U/S
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Renal function continues to improve.  Kidney
   U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving.
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- continue tube feeding today at low goal rate
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, and has since been readmitted multiple times due to various complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PS of 10/5. Her CXR shows new infiltrates, and she is being held on Lasix pending a CT scan.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient's Hct is stable, and she is being monitored for bleeding and transfusion requirements.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have resolved, but she is being monitored for any changes.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a probable cardiac arrest due to probable CAD, and is being monitored on telemetry. She is being held on ASA and Metoprolol, and is receiving Atorvastatin.
* Leukocytosis and fevers: The patient's WBC is trending down, but she is still febrile. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is undergoing further evaluation for a source of infection.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, and she is being monitored for urine output and Cr levels.
* Gastrointestinal issues: The patient is experiencing episodes of emesis after tube feeds, and is being treated with IV Reglan and tube feeds at a low goal rate.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further interventions to improve her lung function.
* Bleeding: The patient's Hct is stable, but she may still be at risk for bleeding due to her splenic artery laceration.
* Infection: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis suggest that she may have an infection, which could worsen her condition if not treated promptly.
* Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiac arrest and probable CAD make her at risk for further cardiac complications.
* Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's episodes of emesis and tube feeds may indicate a need for further gastrointestinal evaluation and management.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and respiratory support
* Monitoring for bleeding and transfusion requirements
* Treating fevers and leukocytosis with broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment as needed
* Managing gastrointestinal issues with IV Reglan and tube feeds
* Continuing cardiac medications and monitoring for cardiac complications
* Performing further diagnostic tests, including a CT scan and kidney U/S, to evaluate the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol, increase dosing to tid
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern for new
   infiltrates on CXR.  Low grade fevers.
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), low threshold to
   add gram positive coverage and additional Pseudomonal coverage
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving,
   intraabd. Compartment syndrome unlikely.  Renal function improving
   slightly today.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- consider re-start tube feeding today
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Diurese with goal net negative 0.5 to 1.0 L today
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation, try PS 5/5
   - ct wean sedation (propofol)
   .
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue metoprolol, increase dosing to tid
   -- continue atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern for new
   infiltrates on CXR.  Low grade fevers.
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue antibiotics (cefepime and fluconazole), low threshold to
   add gram positive coverage and additional Pseudomonal coverage
   --Will hold off on CT a/p for now
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Differential diagnosis includes ATN from
   hypoperfusion during hypotensive episodes, contrast-induced
   nephropathy.  Kidney U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving,
   intraabd. Compartment syndrome unlikely.  Renal function improving
   slightly today.
   -- monitor urine output
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- consider re-start tube feeding today
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress, and today's CXR shows concerning new infiltrates. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and further deterioration is possible.
2. Splenic Artery Laceration: Although the patient's Hct appears stable, there is a risk of further bleeding or splenic rupture. Close monitoring and transfusion for Hct < 26 are necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: Although the patient's hypernatremia has resolved, monitoring is necessary to ensure it does not recur.
4. Cardiac Arrest/Probable CAD: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and there is a risk of further ischemic events or arrhythmias. Close monitoring on telemetry and cardiology recommendations are necessary.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC is trending down, but there is concern for new infiltrates on CXR and low-grade fevers. Further evaluation and antibiotics are necessary.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving slightly, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to ATN or contrast-induced nephropathy. Close monitoring of urine output and renal perfusion is necessary.
7. Anastamotic Leak: The patient's gastrectomy is complicated by anastamotic leak, which may lead to further complications such as sepsis or fistula formation.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and further management is necessary to prevent complications such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
9. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and WBC trend down may indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation and antibiotics are necessary.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastric CA now s/p resection with esophageal stent
   [**Hospital 9460**] hospital course has been complicated by splenic artery
   bleed, VT/VF arrest on the floor, she has had persistent issues of
   pulmonary edema driving need for continued ventilatory support.  She
   has had recurrent fever and has had a modest decrease in SBP across
   time.  This is in the absence of bandemia but is concerning for new
   source of infection with skin source suspected based on exam but
   cultures are pending.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with concern for new source of infection
   with fever and hypotension.  We will have to continue full support  in
   the itnerim with PSV now showing adequate support but with substantial
   increase in RR to maintain effective tidal volume.
   -Move to A/C support today
   -Follow ABG
   -Will use minimum of sedation at this time
   -Add MDI
s for bronchospasm noted on exam this morning
   2)Sepsis-With recurrent fevers we have abdominal source, VAP, Skin
   source, possible DVT, sinusitis and of course fungal infection
   resistant to fluconazole.  Given the above concerns we will
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Fluconazole
   -Send sputum culture and will continue to follow CXR
   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.
   -Wil move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst
   -Will send urine for culture
   -Will check C-Diff today
   3-Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improvement in creatinine noted through today
   -Will continue to assure adequate hydration
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Nutren Pulmonary (Full) - [**2113-12-3**] 02:57 PM 10 mL/hour

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastric CA now s/p resection with esophageal stent
   [**Hospital 9460**] hospital course has been complicated by splenic artery
   bleed, VT/VF arrest on the floor, she has had persistent issues of
   pulmonary edema driving need for continued ventilatory support.  She
   has had recurrent fever and has had a modest decrease in SBP across
   time.  This is in the absence of bandemia but is concerning for new
   source of infection with skin source suspected based on exam but
   cultures are pending.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with concern for new source of infection
   with fever and hypotension.  We will have to continue full support  in
   the itnerim with PSV now showing adequate support but with substantial
   increase in RR to maintain effective tidal volume.
   -Move to A/C support today
   -Follow ABG
   -Will use minimum of sedation at this time
   -Add MDI
s for bronchospasm noted on exam this morning
   2)Sepsis-With recurrent fevers we have abdominal source, VAP, Skin
   source, possible DVT, sinusitis and of course fungal infection
   resistant to fluconazole.  Given the above concerns we will
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Fluconazole
   -Send sputum culture and will continue to follow CXR
   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.
   -Wil move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst
   -Will send urine for culture
   -Will check C-Diff today
   3-Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improvement in creatinine noted through today
   -Will continue to assure adequate hydration
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Nutren Pulmonary (Full) - [**2113-12-3**] 02:57 PM 10 mL/hour

   Total time spent: 45 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with gastric cancer who has undergone resection with an esophageal stent. She has a complicated hospital course, including a splenic artery bleed, VT/VF arrest, and persistent issues with pulmonary edema, requiring continued ventilatory support.

The patient has recurrent fevers, with a current temperature of 101.1°F (38.4°C), and has a negative fluid balance across the night. She has erythema in the J-tube site and IV vancomycin has been added to the treatment regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 16.5 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 13 IU/L and an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 13 IU/L. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient will continue to receive full ventilatory support, with a plan to move to airway clearance support today. ABG will be followed, and sedation will be minimized.
2. Sepsis: The patient has recurrent fevers and is at risk for new sources of infection. Cultures are pending, and the patient will receive antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl, as well as fluconazole. A CT scan will be ordered to evaluate the abdominal source of infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved, and she will continue to receive adequate hydration.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Worsening of respiratory failure, leading to further decline in lung function
* Development of new sources of infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis
* Progression of acute renal failure, leading to chronic kidney disease
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Development of liver failure due to elevated liver enzymes
* Increased risk of mortality due to underlying cancer and comorbidities.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Hold Lasix today in the setting of preparation for CT scan
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5
   -continue to autodiurese, goal euvolemia
   -Will need diagnostic thoracentesis to evaluate worsening leukocytosis,
   large fluid collection on CT scan, concerning for
   emphyema/parapneumonic effusion-> will send cytology (r/o malignant
   effusion), glucose, LDH, pH etc..
   2. LEUKOCYTOSIS- source unclear, likely intra-abdominal or empyema vs
   aspiration PNA
   -- pan Cx, f/u Urine, Blood, Sputum, Stool Cx for C.diff
   -- dx thoracentesis for ?empyema/ infection vs malignant effusion
 will
   need IP c/s
   -- surgery c/s for J-tube evaluation-> bilious draininage and pt having
   bilious emesis
   -- touch base w/ ERCP fellow re: placement NGT/OGT previously said
   unable to place d/t esoph stenting
   -- f/u pleural fluid studies
   -- ct vroad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, fluconazole, flagyl,
   vancomycin)
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection, esophageal stenting, and has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times due to various complications.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation at a pressure of 10 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and their arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 39 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 268 mmHg.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 22.5 K/uL, which is elevated. The source of the leukocytosis is unclear, but it is likely related to an intra-abdominal or empyema/parapneumonic effusion.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient has a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization by interventional radiology (IR).
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level has resolved, but they are still at risk for developing hypernatremia due to their underlying medical conditions.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but they are still at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI).
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 99/53 mmHg, and they are receiving antihypertensive medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they are at risk for developing respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBC count is a sign of inflammation, and it may indicate the presence of an underlying infection or inflammatory condition.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient's splenic artery laceration is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's risk for developing hypernatremia is high due to their underlying medical conditions and the use of diuretics.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but they are still at risk for developing AKI.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is uncontrolled, and they are at risk for developing hypertension-related complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation at a pressure of 10 cmH2O and a FiO2 of 40%.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory rate and ABG results closely to assess their respiratory status.
3. Perform a diagnostic thoracentesis to evaluate the patient's leukocytosis and potential empyema/parapneumonic effusion.
4. Continue to manage the patient's splenic artery laceration with close monitoring and management.
5. Monitor the patient's serum sodium level closely to prevent hypernatremia.
6. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with close monitoring and management.
7. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications.
8. Consider performing a repeat tagged RBC scan if the patient's hematocrit continues to trend down.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status with telemetry monitoring.
10. Consider referring the patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon for further evaluation and management of their cardiac condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with gastric adenocarcinoma who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications, including respiratory failure, splenic artery laceration, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PS of 10 cmH2O. She has new infiltrates on her CXR, and her respiratory status is concerning.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient has undergone embolization, and her Hct is stable.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have resolved, but she will continue to be monitored.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a probable cardiac arrest, and her cardiac status is being monitored.
* Leukocytosis and fever: The patient's WBC count is trending down, but she has had recurrent fevers, and the source of infection is unclear.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but she will continue to be monitored.
* Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has had episodes of emesis after tube feeds and will continue to receive IV Reglan and tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's recurrent fevers and unclear source of infection make sepsis a concern.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's new infiltrates on her CXR and her need for continued ventilatory support make respiratory failure a concern.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's probable cardiac arrest and her need for continued cardiac monitoring make cardiac complications a concern.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of anastomotic leak and her current gastrointestinal issues make gastrointestinal bleeding a concern.
* DVT: The patient's history of VTE and her current immobility make DVT a concern.
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's recurrent fevers and unclear source of infection make sepsis-related organ dysfunction a concern.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation with a PS of 10 cmH2O.
* Moving to A/C support today.
* Following ABG.
* Using minimum sedation at this time.
* Adding MDI for bronchospasm.
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Sending sputum culture and following CXR.
* Evaluating for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies.
* Pursuing CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further evaluating for pulmonary source.
* Pre-treating with bicarb and mucormyst for CT scan.
* Sending urine for culture.
* Checking C-Diff today.
* Continuing to assure adequate hydration for the patient's acute renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Hold Lasix today in the setting of preparation for CT scan
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5
   2.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   3. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue Metoprolol at tid dosing with holding parameters
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   .
   5. Leukocytosis, Fevers: WBC continuing to trend down, however concern
   for new febrile episodes.  No clear source of infection, likely
   abdominal source vs. VAP vs. line infection vs. thromboembolic event
   --Trend WBCs, fever curves
   -- F/u Sputum, Blood and Urine cultures
   -- continue broad coverage with Cefepime, Fluconazole, Flagyl and
   Vancomycin for now pending culture data
   --CT chest / abdomen and pelvis with PO and IV contrast after
   pre-hydration, Mucomyst, bicarb to look for evidence of infection.
   --Needs PIV access for contrast injection
   --f/u final CXR read from today
   --F/u RUE U/S
   .
   6. Acute renal failure: Renal function continues to improve.  Kidney
   U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving.
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- continue tube feeding today at low goal rate
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   -- pain meds PRN
   .
   # HTN:
   -- continue metoprolol
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   74 yo female with gastric CA now s/p resection with esophageal stent
   [**Hospital 9460**] hospital course has been complicated by splenic artery
   bleed, VT/VF arrest on the floor, she has had persistent issues of
   pulmonary edema driving need for continued ventilatory support.  She
   has had recurrent fever and has had a modest decrease in SBP across
   time.  This is in the absence of bandemia but is concerning for new
   source of infection with skin source suspected based on exam but
   cultures are pending.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with concern for new source of infection
   with fever and hypotension.  We will have to continue full support  in
   the itnerim with PSV now showing adequate support but with substantial
   increase in RR to maintain effective tidal volume.
   -Move to A/C support today
   -Follow ABG
   -Will use minimum of sedation at this time
   -Add MDI
s for bronchospasm noted on exam this morning
   2)Sepsis-With recurrent fevers we have abdominal source, VAP, Skin
   source, possible DVT, sinusitis and of course fungal infection
   resistant to fluconazole.  Given the above concerns we will
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Fluconazole
   -Send sputum culture and will continue to follow CXR
   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.
   -Wil move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst
   -Will send urine for culture
   -Will check C-Diff today
   3-Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improvement in creatinine noted through today
   -Will continue to assure adequate hydration

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   -Will have to evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies
   -Will pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further
   evaluate for pulmonary source as well and will move to
 contrast
   through the feeding tube and IV contrast is possible as we have
   improvement in creatinine today.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with gastric adenocarcinoma, s/p resection, and esophageal stenting. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Currently, she is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and her current CXR shows new infiltrates. She requires continued mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5.
2. Splenic Artery Laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration requiring embolization, and her Hct appears stable. However, she requires close monitoring of her Hct and platelet count, and transfusion may be necessary if her Hct falls below 26.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but she requires continued monitoring to ensure that her sodium levels remain within a normal range.
4. Cardiac Arrest/Probable CAD: The patient had a cardiac arrest, and her echo showed LV systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. She requires close monitoring for signs of ischemia, and her medications may need to be adjusted.
5. Leukocytosis and Fevers: The patient has leukocytosis and recurrent fevers, which may be due to a new source of infection. She requires close monitoring of her WBC count and fever curve, and cultures should be sent to determine the source of the infection.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and her kidney U/S is unremarkable. She requires close monitoring of her urine output and creatinine level, and her medications may need to be adjusted to ensure adequate renal perfusion.
7. Anastomotic Leak: The patient had a gastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak, and she is currently receiving tube feeds. She requires close monitoring of her tube feed intake and output, and her medications may need to be adjusted to manage her symptoms.
8. HTN: The patient has hypertension, and her medications may need to be adjusted to manage her blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 14.9
* Hct: 32.5
* Platelet count: 54
* Creatinine: 1.7
* Sodium: 115
* Potassium: 4.5
* Magnesium: 2.5
* Phosphorus: 2.6
* Calcium: 6.8
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 349 IU/L
* Troponin-T: 0.03
* ALT: 13
* AST: 13
* Alk Phos: 107
* T Bili: 0.8

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast: shows a large left-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the left lower lobe, small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, and a gastroesophageal stent with interval decrease in extraluminal air.
* RUE U/S: negative for DVT.
* Kidney U/S: unremarkable.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5.
* Monitor her WBC count and fever curve, and send cultures to determine the source of the infection.
* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Cefepime, Fluconazole, Flagyl, and Vancomycin.
* Send sputum culture and continue to follow CXR.
* Evaluate for DVT with UE and LE non-invasive studies.
* Pursue CT scan for evaluation of abdominal source and further evaluate for pulmonary source.
* Move to pre-treat with bicarb and mucormyst.
* Send urine for culture.
* Check C-Diff today.
* Continue to assure adequate hydration and monitor her creatinine level.
* Continue tube feeds at low goal rate.
* Monitor her pain level and adjust her pain medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor her blood pressure and adjust her medications as needed.
* Continue to monitor her cardiac status and adjust her medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis in the setting of gastrointestinal malignancy and a stent in the gastroesophageal junction with ongoing drainage of intra-peritoneal collection. She has had persistent fevers, moderate hypotension, and no alternative source of infection found. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and is at risk for aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and hypotension suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not addressed promptly.
2. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to her gastrointestinal malignancy and stent placement, which can lead to respiratory failure and pneumonia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a primary defect in compliance, which can be exacerbated by her aspiration risk.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to hypotension and dehydration, which can be worsened by her ongoing sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal malignancy and stent placement increase her risk of bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
6. Infection: The patient's ongoing sepsis and risk of aspiration increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's tube feeds have been held due to evaluation of J-tube placement, which can lead to malnutrition and further compromise her immune function.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's ongoing fluid and electrolyte imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to address ongoing sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation as necessary.
3. Implement measures to prevent aspiration, such as elevating the head of the bed and suctioning the patient regularly.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
5. Consider gastroenterology consultation to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal malignancy and stent placement.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte balance and adjust as necessary to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Hold Lasix today in the setting of preparation for CT scan
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue mechanical ventilation at PS 10/5
   -continue to autodiurese, goal euvolemia
   -Will need diagnostic thoracentesis to evaluate worsening leukocytosis,
   large fluid collection on CT scan, concerning for
   emphyema/parapneumonic effusion-> will send cytology (r/o malignant
   effusion), glucose, LDH, pH etc..
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.
   -- f/u all outsdtanding Urine, Blood, Sputum, pleural fluid Cx
   -- Discuss with surgery about any other possible surgical intervention
   -- f/u pleural fluid studies
   -- ct vroad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, fluconazole, flagyl,
   vancomycin)

   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications, including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, pulseless VT/VF arrest, and splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

Current status:

* The patient is intubated and sedated, not responding to voice commands.
* She has a left pleural effusion, which was diagnosed through diagnostic thoracentesis, and is being treated with Levophed for hypotension.
* The patient has a J-tube in place, which is draining bilious fluids and appears erythematous with puckered skin, concerning for skin infection.
* She has a history of anastomotic leak and is experiencing episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
* The patient has acute renal failure, which is improving, and is being treated with IV fluids and diuretics.
* She has hypernatremia, which has resolved, and is being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated. There is a concern for new infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which may indicate worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which are concerning signs of sepsis. The source of sepsis is unclear, but it is likely intra-abdominal.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient has a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization. The patient's hemoglobin level appears stable at this point, but the patient will need to be monitored for any signs of bleeding.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, which has resolved. However, the patient will need to be monitored to ensure that it does not recur.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is improving. The patient will need to be monitored for any signs of worsening renal function.
6. Skin infection: The patient's J-tube site appears erythematous with puckered skin, which is concerning for skin infection. The patient will need to be monitored for any signs of infection.
7. Anastomotic leak: The patient has a history of anastomotic leak and is experiencing episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds. The patient will need to be monitored for any signs of worsening anastomotic leak.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which may indicate an ischemic event. The patient will need to be monitored for any signs of cardiac instability.

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
* Monitor the patient's splenic artery laceration and hemoglobin level to ensure that it does not bleed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hypernatremia and acute renal failure to ensure that it does not recur.
* Monitor the patient's J-tube site for any signs of infection and adjust treatment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's anastomotic leak and adjust treatment as needed.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, s/p resection, and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient has had multiple episodes of intubation, including one due to pulseless VT/VF arrest, and has been diagnosed with splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: intubated on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis: fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, with unclear source, likely intra-abdominal, but other sources possible
* Splenic artery laceration: Hct appears stable, but f/u with IR and surgery recommended
* Hypernatremia: resolved, but continue to monitor
* Possible cardiac arrest/probable CAD: no known cardiac history, but echo with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so concern for ischemic event as etiology
* Acute renal failure: worsening, likely ATN secondary to sepsis/hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
* Anastomotic leak: s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak s/p stenting, with episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds
* HTN: hold metoprolol given hypotension, and holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
* h/o breast CA: continue Arimidex

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: continued need for mechanical ventilation, risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Sepsis: progression to septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death
3. Splenic artery laceration: further bleeding, splenic rupture, or infection
4. Acute renal failure: progression to chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis, or death
5. Anastomotic leak: further complications, such as peritonitis, abscess, or fistula
6. HTN: worsening hypertension, cardiac complications, or stroke
7. Cardiac arrest: further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias, infarction, or death

Recommendations:

1. Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
2. Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, fluconazole, flagyl, vancomycin) for sepsis
4. Monitor CVP and trend Hct
5. F/u with IR and surgery recommendations for splenic artery laceration
6. Continue to monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, infarction, or death
7. F/u with GI and surgery recs for anastomotic leak
8. Monitor for signs of worsening acute renal failure, such as increasing creatinine or oliguria
9. Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
10. Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis, such as fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, and adjust antibiotics as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.

   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- Holding Metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: Acuet worsening, likely ATN secondary to
   sepsis/ hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   appears erythematous w/ puckered skin concerning for skin infx although
   gen [**Doctor First Name **] does not think this is concerning
   -she continues to have bilious emesis
   -surgery says to place NGT under fluoro guidance, called GI was against
   NGT d/t esoph stenting
   -due to worsening left pleural effusion, had diagnostic thoracentesis.
   600cc of serosanginous turbid fluid removed, with lab data showing
   exudative effusion, cytology pending.  No empyema.
   -Had palliative care c/s  ordered
   -Gave multiple fluid boluses d/t poor UOP
   -Around 1am, the patient is tachycardic to 120s, hypotensive.  Hct was

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting. She was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, and later readmitted to the MICU for pulseless VT/VF arrest and splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent increase in oxygen requirement and new infiltrates on chest X-ray.
* Sepsis: She has fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, with a possible source of infection in the intra-abdominal area, but other sources such as infected central venous lines and sinuses are also possible.
* Splenic artery laceration: Her hematocrit appears stable, but she is at risk for further bleeding and may require repeat transfusions.
* Hypernatremia: This has resolved, but she will need to be monitored for any future electrolyte imbalances.
* Cardiac arrest: She had a recent cardiac arrest and is at risk for another ischemic event, with a possible diagnosis of CAD.
* Acute renal failure: Her renal function is worsening, with a possible diagnosis of ATN secondary to sepsis/hypotension or contrast-induced nephropathy.
* Gastrointestinal issues: She has had episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds and is at risk for further complications.
* Hypertension: She has hypertension, which is being managed with medication, but will need to be monitored closely due to her recent cardiac arrest and bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Sepsis: Septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death
* Splenic artery laceration: Further bleeding, splenic rupture, and death
* Hypernatremia: Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and seizures
* Cardiac arrest: Re-arrest, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death
* Acute renal failure: Chronic kidney disease, dialysis dependence, and death
* Gastrointestinal issues: Gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis
* Hypertension: Cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke

The patient's goals of care include discussing goals of care with oncology, and the family meeting has been scheduled to discuss these goals. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and do not re-intubate."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, splenic laceration, and cardiac arrest. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is concerning due to the following:

1. Bilious drainage from the J-tube site, which may indicate a skin infection or abscess.
2. Worsening left pleural effusion, which may be causing respiratory distress.
3. Leukocytosis, which may be indicative of an underlying infection.
4. Hypotension, which may be causing poor perfusion to vital organs.
5. Acute renal failure, which may be causing electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis or septic shock due to the potential skin infection or abscess.
2. Respiratory failure due to the worsening pleural effusion.
3. Infection or empyema due to the pleural fluid.
4. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias due to hypotension and poor perfusion.
5. Renal failure or worsening of existing renal dysfunction.
6. Electrolyte imbalances due to the acute renal failure.
7. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to the patient's compromised respiratory status.
8. Malignant effusion or tumor recurrence due to the patient's history of gastric adenocarcinoma.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Diagnostic thoracentesis to evaluate the pleural effusion and rule out malignant effusion.
2. Antibiotics to treat potential infections.
3. Vasopressors to support blood pressure and perfusion.
4. Fluid management to maintain euvolemia and prevent fluid overload.
5. Pain management to prevent discomfort and promote respiratory comfort.
6. Nutritional support through tube feeding.
7. Cardiovascular management to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic events.
8. Renal management to monitor for worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is not to be reintubated. The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the medical floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -belly seems rigid, bilious fluid draining from J-tube site which
   appears erythematous w/ puckered skin concerning for skin infx although
   gen [**Doctor First Name **] does not think this is concerning
   -she continues to have bilious emesis
   -surgery says to place NGT under fluoro guidance, called GI was against
   NGT d/t esoph stenting
   -due to worsening left pleural effusion, had diagnostic thoracentesis.
   600cc of serosanginous turbid fluid removed, with lab data showing
   exudative effusion, cytology pending.  No empyema.
   -Had palliative care c/s  ordered
   -Gave multiple fluid boluses d/t poor UOP
   -Around 1am, the patient is tachycardic to 120s, hypotensive.  Hct was
   stable.  The patient was started on Levophed for hypotension.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations. Today met diuresis goals, but CXR concerning for new
   infiltrates.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.
   -- f/u all outsdtanding Urine, Blood, Sputum, pleural fluid Cx
   -- Discuss with surgery about any other possible surgical intervention
   -- f/u pleural fluid studies
   -- ct broad spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, fluconazole, flagyl,
   vancomycin)
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- continue Metoprolol at tid dosing with holding parameters
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: Renal function continues to improve.  Kidney
   U/S unremarkable.  Bladder pressures improving.
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- continue tube feeding today at low goal rate

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 10**]<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns are identified:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory distress, and there are concerns about new infiltrates on the CXR.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which are indicative of sepsis. The source of the infection is unclear, but it is likely to be intra-abdominal. Other possible sources, such as infected central venous lines and sinuses, should be considered.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient has a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization. The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but the patient is at risk for further bleeding.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level has resolved, but it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which is likely related to probable CAD. The patient should be monitored closely for any signs of cardiac instability.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but the patient is still at risk for further deterioration. Kidney ultrasound is unremarkable, and bladder pressures are improving.
7. Anastomotic leak: The patient has an anastomotic leak, which is complicated by emesis and tube feeding.
8. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with medications.
9. Breast cancer: The patient has a history of breast cancer and is taking Arimidex.
10. Skin infection: The patient has a skin infection around the J-tube site, which is concerning for skin infx.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain medications, and antihypertensives. The patient's vital signs are being closely monitored, and the patient is being treated for various medical conditions. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the patient is not to be reintubated."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic colon cancer now with evolution of
   persistent sepsis in the setting of multiple intra-abdominal fluid
   collections which have been addressed with drainage but with persistent
   respiratory failure and fever despite antibiotic therapy in the setting
   of hospital course complicated by V-Fib arrest.  This is in the setting
   of continued rising WBC count and we have pursued repeat imaging and
   drainage of pleural fluid without obvious evidence of acute infection
   to provide a unifying new insult to be addressed.  This leaves us with
   persistent insult of colon cancer with intra-abdominal fluid collection
   and with worsening of renal failure and persistent respiratory failure
   all making and reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9499**]
   with time.
   1)SEPSIS-This appears to be continued insult with intra-abdominal
   process and we do not have any further findings to suggest alternative
   source at this time.  Of the list of possible alternative sources the
   sinuses, central line remain possible but less likely.  Pleural
   effusion was drained and does not seem to be a primary source.  We do
   have concern for persistent collection driving picture and will have to
   consider any possible further investigations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who has developed sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The patient has undergone various interventions, including drainage of intra-abdominal fluid collections, antibiotic therapy, and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: Continued insult from the intra-abdominal process, with a rising WBC count and no obvious alternative source of infection. This may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires full A/C support, and further deterioration of respiratory function may lead to increased risk of respiratory arrest.
3. Renal failure: Worsening renal function may lead to electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
4. Cancer progression: The patient's metastatic colon cancer may continue to progress, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient has had a history of V-Fib arrest, and further cardiac instability may lead to cardiac arrest.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Sepsis: Continue antibiotic therapy, consider further investigations to identify alternative sources of infection, and discuss with surgery.
2. Respiratory failure: Continue full A/C support, monitor blood gas findings, and adjust PIP as necessary.
3. Renal failure: Monitor urine lytes, perform renal ultrasound, and follow creatinine levels. Check bladder pressure and consider further interventions as necessary.
4. Cancer: Discuss current role of malignancy and potential further treatments with the patient and family.
5. Cardiac arrest: Maintain stability of rhythm and monitor cardiac function.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: Trial J-tube feeds.
2. Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale.
3. Lines: Maintain arterial line, multi-lumen line, and 20-gauge line.
4. Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP prophylaxis.

The patient's code status is DNR, and the disposition is ICU. The patient is critically ill, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, recently diagnosed and undergoing treatment. She was initially admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, then readmitted to the MICU after a pulseless VT/VF arrest and diagnosis of a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of respiratory failure, hematemesis, and cardiac arrest, and is at risk for further complications.

The note highlights several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated five times due to respiratory distress, and is currently receiving volume-controlled mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which may be indicative of sepsis. The source of the infection is unclear, but may be intra-abdominal, infected central venous line, or sinusitis.
3. Splenic artery laceration: The patient has a splenic artery laceration that was treated with embolization, and is at risk for further bleeding.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may be a complication of her underlying medical condition or treatment.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is worsening, and may be secondary to sepsis, hypotension, or contrast-induced nephropathy.
6. Anastomotic leak: The patient has a history of gastrectomy complicated by anastomotic leak, which may be contributing to her current symptoms.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be a complication of her underlying medical condition or treatment.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, which may be related to her underlying medical condition or treatment.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is receiving volume-controlled mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat potential infections.
3. Fluid management: The patient is receiving IV fluids to manage her hypotension and hypovolemia.
4. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain medication to manage her discomfort.
5. Nutrition: The patient is NPO and is not receiving tube feeds or TPN due to her anastomotic leak.
6. Glycemic control: The patient's blood sugar levels are being monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic medication to prevent DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's goals of care include discussing her goals with oncology and holding a family meeting to discuss her treatment options. Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and do not re-intubate."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   -Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort.
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.
   -- f/u all outsdtanding Urine, Blood, Sputum, pleural fluid Cx
   -- f/u pleural fluid studies
   --Will add Meropenem, Linezolid and Micofungin (d/c Vancomycin and
   Fluconazole) to broaden coverage to ESBL Klebsiella, VRE and broaded
   antifungal coverage.
   --IVF boluses as needed for MAP>65, re-start Levophed if necessary
   --Trend CVP
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- Holding Metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: RF continues to worsen, likely ATN secondary to
   sepsis/ hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
   --send Urine lytes prior to and after fluid challenge
   --Assess urine sediment
   --Renal consult.
   --Monitor bladder pressures
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- start TPN, no tube feeds
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   .
   # HTN:
   --hold metoprolol given hypotension
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex
   #Goals of care
   --Ongoing discussion with the family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.

   respirations.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   -Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort.
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.

   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection, esophageal stenting, and has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times due to respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Intubated and sedated, not responsive to voice commands
* Bilious emesis
* Hypotensive at night, with MAPs in the high 50s
* Trending upward LDH and AP levels
* Respiratory failure, requiring volume-controlled mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis, with unclear source, likely intra-abdominal
* Splenic artery laceration, treated with embolization
* Hypernatremia, resolved
* Acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis, hypotension, or contrast-induced nephropathy
* Anastamotic leak after gastrectomy, with episodes of emesis
* Hypertension, with medications held due to hypotension
* History of breast cancer, with ongoing treatment with Arimidex

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support
* Sepsis, with potential for organ failure
* Acute kidney injury, requiring dialysis
* Anastamotic leak, with potential for further complications
* Hypertension, with potential for cardiovascular complications
* Breast cancer recurrence, with potential for metastasis
* Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or ischemic events

The patient's goals of care are ongoing discussion with the family, discussing pain management, and ICU care. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and they do not want to be re-intubated. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, and is receiving supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and fluids."

          Respiratory failure
          Acute renal failure
          Hypotension
          Fever and ?sepsis
          s/p VF arrest
          complicated intra-abdominal pathology (partial gastrectomy
   with a nastomic leak s/p esophageal stent, splenic hemorrhage s/p
   coiling, etc.)
   She continues to spike fevers and have relatively high-grade
   leucocytosis in spite of rx with vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Although
   non-infectious causes are possible, abdominal sites of infection seem
   most likely.  It therefore seems reasonable to expand coverage to
   include VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant [**Female First Name (un) **].  Have discussed
   with surgery and they feel no anatomic intervention is needed at this
   point.  We will check urine lytes and CVP, then bolus fluid, then
   reassess.  Suspect some of the ARF may be responsive to this maneuver.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   74-year-old woman with
          Respiratory failure
          Acute renal failure
          Hypotension
          Fever and ?sepsis
          s/p VF arrest
          complicated intra-abdominal pathology (partial gastrectomy
   with a nastomic leak s/p esophageal stent, splenic hemorrhage s/p
   coiling, etc.)
   She continues to spike fevers and have relatively high-grade
   leucocytosis in spite of rx with vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  Although
   non-infectious causes are possible, abdominal sites of infection seem
   most likely.  It therefore seems reasonable to expand coverage to
   include VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant [**Female First Name (un) **].  Have discussed
   with surgery and they feel no anatomic intervention is needed at this
   point.  We will check urine lytes and CVP, then bolus fluid, then
   reassess.  Suspect some of the ARF may be responsive to this maneuver.
   Other issues as per ICU team note today.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman who is critically ill with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, fever, and suspected sepsis following a VF arrest. She has undergone multiple surgeries, including a partial gastrectomy with a nastomic leak, splenic hemorrhage, and esophageal stent placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.5°F (38.6°C)
* Hypotension: 92/49 mmHg
* Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 40%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 2 mmHg, Bladder pressure 17 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total input 3,247 mL, total output 415 mL
* Lab results:
	+ WBC: 22.5 K/uL
	+ Hct: 28.8%
	+ Plt: 52 K/uL
	+ Cr: 2.8 mg/dL
	+ TCO2: 27 mmHg
	+ Glucose: 143 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: Elevated levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH

The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of multiple comorbidities, including intra-abdominal pathology, which may be a source of infection. The patient is at risk for developing septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury or failure
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock
* Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding or hematoma formation
* Infection-related complications, such as abscesses or peritonitis
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as ileus or perforation

The patient's treatment plan includes expanding antibiotic coverage to include VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant organisms, as well as continuing respiratory support and fluid management. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she is currently being managed in the ICU."

          Fever and ?sepsis
          s/p VF arrest
          complicated intra-abdominal pathology
   74 yo female with metastatic colon cancer now with evolution of
   persistent sepsis in the setting of multiple intra-abdominal fluid
   collections which have been addressed with drainage but with persistent
   respiratory failure and fever despite antibiotic therapy in the setting
   of hospital course complicated by V-Fib arrest.  This is in the setting
   of continued rising WBC count and we have pursued repeat imaging and
   drainage of pleural fluid without obvious evidence of acute infection
   to provide a unifying new insult to be addressed.  This leaves us with
   persistent insult of colon cancer with intra-abdominal fluid collection
   and with worsening of renal failure and persistent respiratory failure
   all making and reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9499**]
   with time.
   1)SEPSIS-This appears to be continued insult with intra-abdominal
   process and we do not have any further findings to suggest alternative
   source at this time.  Of the list of possible alternative sources the
   sinuses, central line remain possible but less likely.  Pleural
   effusion was drained and does not seem to be a primary source.  We do
   have concern for persistent collection driving picture and will have to
   consider any possible further investigations.
   -Will discuss with surgery

   -Flagyl/Cefepime/Vanco/Fluconazole

   -Will follow cultures going forward
   -In regards to CVL
site appears clean, do not have positive blood
   cultures and will maintain ongoing support pending positive blood
   cultures from the line itself.  Do not have any evidence of drainge
   from above.
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-Patient with continued need for full A/C support
   and will maintain based upon favorable blood gas findings and
   acceptable PIP=26
   -Continue with A/C
   3)RENAL FAILURE-The patient has worsening renal function-
   -Will need urine lytes
   -Will need renal ultrasound
   -Will need for follow creatinine
   -Will check bladder pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

          s/p VF arrest
          complicated intra-abdominal pathology
   74 yo female with metastatic colon cancer now with evolution of
   persistent sepsis in the setting of multiple intra-abdominal fluid
   collections which have been addressed with drainage but with persistent
   respiratory failure and fever despite antibiotic therapy in the setting
   of hospital course complicated by V-Fib arrest.  This is in the setting
   of continued rising WBC count and we have pursued repeat imaging and
   drainage of pleural fluid without obvious evidence of acute infection
   to provide a unifying new insult to be addressed.  This leaves us with
   persistent insult of colon cancer with intra-abdominal fluid collection
   and with worsening of renal failure and persistent respiratory failure
   all making and reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 9499**]
   with time.
   1)SEPSIS-This appears to be continued insult with intra-abdominal
   process and we do not have any further findings to suggest alternative
   source at this time.  Of the list of possible alternative sources the
   sinuses, central line remain possible but less likely.  Pleural
   effusion was drained and does not seem to be a primary source.  We do
   have concern for persistent collection driving picture and will have to
   consider any possible further investigations.
   -Will discuss with surgery

   -Flagyl/Cefepime/Vanco/Fluconazole
we have > 2 weeks on Cefepime/Fluc,
   we have day #3 of Vancomycin, and we have D #6 of Flagyl
   -Will follow cultures going forward
   -In regards to CVL
site appears clean, do not have positive blood
   cultures and will maintain ongoing support pending positive blood
   cultures from the line itself.  Do not have any evidence of drainge
   from above.
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-Patient with continued need for full A/C support
   and will maintain based upon favorable blood gas findings and
   acceptable PIP=26
   -Continue with A/C
   3)RENAL FAILURE-The patient has worsening renal function-
   -Will need urine lytes
   -Will need renal ultrasound
   -Will need for follow creatinine
   -Will check bladder pressure
   4) CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), STOMACH
   -Simply need to discuss current role of malignancy and what if any
   further treatments would be possible.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including metastatic colon cancer, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure. She has had multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections, which have been addressed with drainage, but persistent sepsis and fever remain a concern.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires full A/C support and has favorable blood gas findings, but her PIP is 26, which may indicate ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and she requires urine lytes, renal ultrasound, and follow-up creatinine levels.
3. Sepsis: The patient has persistent sepsis, and the source of infection is unclear. The sinuses, central line, and pleural effusion have been evaluated, but no alternative source has been identified.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib) arrest, which was successfully treated. However, her cardiac rhythm remains unstable, and she requires ongoing cardiac monitoring.
5. Cancer: The patient has metastatic colon cancer, and her malignancy is likely contributing to her current condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Progressive sepsis: The patient's persistent sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress may worsen, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to acute kidney injury, requiring dialysis and potentially impacting her overall prognosis.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's unstable cardiac rhythm may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia.
5. Infection control: The patient's central line and other lines may be at risk for infection, which could lead to further complications and treatment challenges.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan accordingly. This may involve consulting with specialists, such as surgeons, cardiologists, and nephrologists, to optimize her care and address any emerging complications."

   -as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 906**], we changed antibiotic regimen as follows:
   1. D/C'd Vanc and added Linezolid to cover VRE
   2. D/C'd Ceftriaxone and added Meropenem (pseudomonal coverage)
   3. D/C'd fluconazole and added micafungin for broader intra-abdominal
   fungal coverage (ie C.glabrada)
   4. Kept flagyl the same for anaerobe coverage
   - [**Location (un) 906**] wants ID consult tomorrow to figure out why they didn't really
   want micafungin instead of fluconazole
   - Checked urine lytes and urine sodium was 25, CVP was 2. Then gave 1L
   fluid, urine output didn't pick up and CVP still 2.  Then gave 1 unit
   blood plus 1L NS and rechecked urine lytes.  After 1L NS, CVP was 8 but
   PEEP was 5.  Gave another 500cc NS.  CVP increased to 12.
   - As she isn't taking po meds, dc'ed metoprolol, arimidex, and
   atorvastatin - will need to be added back if she can ever take po
   - PM Hct stable at 27.2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who has undergone resection and esophageal stenting, and has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving volume-controlled mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, and the source of sepsis is unclear, but likely intra-abdominal.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient had a splenic artery laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, likely due to sepsis and hypotension.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a probable cardiac arrest, and an echo with LV systolic dysfunction was consistent with CAD.
* Anastamotic leak: The patient has an anastamotic leak following gastrectomy, which is complicated by emesis and tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to require mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Sepsis: The patient may develop further complications from sepsis, such as organ failure or death.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient may develop further bleeding or complications from the splenic artery laceration.
* Acute renal failure: The patient may require dialysis or further interventions to manage their renal function.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient may develop further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
* Anastamotic leak: The patient may develop further complications from the anastamotic leak, such as peritonitis or abscess formation.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing volume-controlled mechanical ventilation
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover ESBL Klebsiella, VRE, and broad-spectrum antifungal coverage
* IV fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP>65
* Trending CVP
* Transfusing for Hct<26
* Maintaining active T+S with multiple units crossed
* Holding ASA and metoprolol in the setting of recent massive bleeding
* Continuing atorvastatin
* Monitoring bladder pressures and urine output
* Monitoring renal function and considering renal consult
* Continuing IV Reglan for vomiting
* Starting TPN, no tube feeds
* F/u GI and surgery recs

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and do not re-intubate."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   -Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort.
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.
   -- f/u all outsdtanding Urine, Blood, Sputum, pleural fluid Cx
   -- f/u pleural fluid studies
   --Will add Meropenem, Linezolid and Micofungin (d/c Vancomycin and
   Fluconazole) to broaden coverage to ESBL Klebsiella, VRE and broaded
   antifungal coverage.
   --IVF boluses as needed for MAP>65, re-start Levophed if necessary
   --Trend CVP
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- Holding Metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: RF continues to worsen, likely ATN secondary to
   sepsis/ hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
   --send Urine lytes prior to and after fluid challenge
   --Assess urine sediment
   --Renal consult.
   --Monitor bladder pressures
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion
   .
   # s/p gastrectomy complicated by anastamotic leak s/p stenting:
   Episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds.
   -- Continue IV Reglan for vomiting
   -- start TPN, no tube feeds
   -- f/u GI and surgery recs
   .
   # HTN:
   --hold metoprolol given hypotension
   -- holding Diovan in setting of ARF and recent bleeding
   .
   # h/o breast CA
   -- continue Arimidex
   #Goals of care
   --Ongoing discussion with the family
   --Discuss pain management with increased doses of Fentanyl

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 FEVER - 101.2
F - [**2113-12-8**] 02:00 AM
   -as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 906**], we changed antibiotic regimen as follows:
   1. D/C'd Vanc and added Linezolid to cover VRE
   2. D/C'd Ceftriaxone and added Meropenem (pseudomonal coverage)
   3. D/C'd fluconazole and added micafungin for broader intra-abdominal
   fungal coverage (ie C.glabrada)
   4. Kept flagyl the same for anaerobe coverage
   - [**Location (un) 906**] wants ID consult tomorrow to figure out why they didn't really
   want micafungin instead of fluconazole
   - Checked urine lytes and urine sodium was 25, CVP was 2. Then gave 1L
   fluid, urine output didn't pick up and CVP still 2.  Then gave 1 unit
   blood plus 1L NS and rechecked urine lytes.  After 1L NS, CVP was 8 but
   PEEP was 5.  Gave another 500cc NS.  CVP increased to 12.
   - As she isn't taking po meds, dc'ed metoprolol, arimidex, and
   atorvastatin - will need to be added back if she can ever take po
   - PM Hct stable at 27.2

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   -Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort.
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.

   --Will add Meropenem, Linezolid and Micofungin (d/c Vancomycin and
   Fluconazole) to broaden coverage to ESBL Klebsiella, VRE and broaded
   antifungal coverage.
   --IVF boluses as needed for MAP>65, re-start Levophed if necessary
   --Trend CVP
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- f/u IR and surgery recommendations
   -- f/u Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S with multiple units crossed
   -- Consider repeat tagged RBC scan if Hct continues to trend down
   4. HYPERNATREMIA- resolved, continue to monitor [**Hospital1 **]
   5. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, so there is concern for an
   ischemic event as an etiology.
   -- Monitor on telemetry: no ectopy today
   -- f/u cardiology recs
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- Holding Metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   -- continue Atorvastatin
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: RF continues to worsen, likely ATN secondary to
   sepsis/ hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
   --send Urine lytes prior to and after fluid challenge
   --Assess urine sediment
   --Renal consult.
   --Monitor bladder pressures
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, recently diagnosed and treated with resection, esophageal stenting, and massive transfusion for splenic laceration.
* She is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, and has a history of pulseless VT/VF arrest and cardiac arrest.
* Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), heart rate of 106 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg.
* Laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels, suggesting sepsis.
* The patient has a history of anastomotic leak after gastrectomy, which may be contributing to her current respiratory distress and vomiting.
* She has also had a recent cardiac arrest, which may be related to coronary artery disease.
* The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with increasing creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to uncontrolled infection
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated lung injury
* Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
* Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure
* Gastrointestinal complications, including anastomotic leak and bleeding
* Hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis
* Thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism

The patient's current management plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible intra-abdominal and respiratory infections
* Mechanical ventilation and respiratory support
* Renal replacement therapy and hemodynamic monitoring
* Cardiac monitoring and management of cardiac arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal support, including tube feeding and total parenteral nutrition
* Pain management and sedation

The patient's goals of care include ongoing discussion with the family and consideration of palliative care and end-of-life planning."

          Hypotension
          Fever and ?sepsis

          complicated intra-abdominal pathology (partial gastrectomy
   with a nastomic leak s/p esophageal stent, splenic hemorrhage s/p
   coiling, etc.)
   She continues to spike fevers and have relatively high-grade
   leucocytosis in spite of rx with vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  We switched
   yesterday to cover VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant [**Female First Name (un) **].  Have
   discussed with surgery and they feel no anatomic intervention is needed
   at this point.  Oliguria remains significant and creatinine remains
   quite abnormal.  Although non-infectious causes are possible, infection
   seems most likely except potentially for splenic hematoma.  Other
   issues as per ICU team note today.
   Prognosis is dire.  Will meet with family today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

          Acute renal failure
          Hypotension
          Fever and ?sepsis

          complicated intra-abdominal pathology (partial gastrectomy
   with a nastomic leak s/p esophageal stent, splenic hemorrhage s/p
   coiling, etc.)
   She continues to spike fevers and have relatively high-grade
   leucocytosis in spite of rx with vanco, cefepime, flagyl.  We switched
   yesterday to cover VRE, ESBL, and fluconazole-resistant [**Female First Name (un) **].  Have
   discussed with surgery and they feel no anatomic intervention is needed
   at this point.  Oliguria remains significant and creatinine remains
   quite abnormal.  Although non-infectious causes are possible, infection
   seems most likely except potentially for splenic hematoma.  Other
   issues as per ICU team note today.
   Prognosis is dire.  Will meet with family today.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, fever, and possible sepsis. She has undergone various surgical interventions, including a partial gastrectomy with a nastomic leak and splenic hemorrhage. The patient's current condition is critical, with a dire prognosis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 110 beats per minute (102-118 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 98/55 mmHg (70-164/84-112 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (15-27 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 12 mmHg (2-12 mmHg)

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 22.5 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 29.0%
* Platelet count: 543 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19 mEq/L
* Glucose: 311 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na+ 142 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, Cl- 110 mEq/L, Ca++ 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.2 mg/dL, PO4 3.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. She is also receiving TPN for nutrition and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leucocytosis, and oliguria suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and her oxygen saturation is low, indicating respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest or death.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and leucocytosis suggest possible infection, which can lead to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of splenic hemorrhage and gastrectomy with nastomic leak increases her risk of bleeding complications, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's TPN may not be providing adequate nutrition, which can lead to malnutrition, weakness, and decreased immune function.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which can lead to hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and increased risk of infection.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and medication administration. The patient's prognosis is dire, and it is crucial to discuss her treatment options and prognosis with her family."

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2113-12-7**]
   -as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 906**], we changed antibiotic regimen as follows:
   1. D/C'd Vanc and added Linezolid to cover VRE
   2. D/C'd Ceftriaxone and added Meropenem (pseudomonal coverage)
   3. D/C'd fluconazole and added micafungin for broader intra-abdominal
   fungal coverage (ie C.glabrada)
   4. Kept flagyl the same for anaerobe coverage
   - [**Location (un) 906**] wants ID consult tomorrow to figure out why they didn't really
   want micafungin instead of fluconazole
   - Checked urine lytes and urine sodium was 25, CVP was 2. Then gave 1L
   fluid, urine output didn't pick up and CVP still 2.  Then gave 1 unit
   blood plus 1L NS and rechecked urine lytes.  After 1L NS, CVP was 8 but
   PEEP was 5.  Gave another 500cc NS.  CVP increased to 12.
   - As she isn't taking po meds, dc'ed metoprolol, arimidex, and
   atorvastatin - will need to be added back if she can ever take po
   - PM Hct stable at 27.2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2113-12-7**]
   -as per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 906**], we changed antibiotic regimen as follows:
   1. D/C'd Vanc and added Linezolid to cover VRE
   2. D/C'd Ceftriaxone and added Meropenem (pseudomonal coverage)
   3. D/C'd fluconazole and added micafungin for broader intra-abdominal
   fungal coverage (ie C.glabrada)
   4. Kept flagyl the same for anaerobe coverage
   - [**Location (un) 906**] wants ID consult tomorrow to figure out why they didn't really
   want micafungin instead of fluconazole
   - Checked urine lytes and urine sodium was 25, CVP was 2. Then gave 1L
   fluid, urine output didn't pick up and CVP still 2.  Then gave 1 unit
   blood plus 1L NS and rechecked urine lytes.  After 1L NS, CVP was 8 but
   PEEP was 5.  Gave another 500cc NS.  CVP increased to 12.
   - As she isn't taking po meds, dc'ed metoprolol, arimidex, and
   atorvastatin - will need to be added back if she can ever take po
   - PM Hct stable at 27.2

   [**2113-12-8**]
   -family leaning more towards CMO status, but at this point, continue
   current management, want to see if there is progress w/ abx ?
   -cytology from pleural fluid negative for malignant cells
   -blood sugars running high, started insulin gtt

   74 yo F w/ recently dx gastric adeno CA, s/p resection, transferred
   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.

   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Check lytes tid and replete for K>4, Mg > 2
   -Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings,
   pt cannot tolerate PS
   -Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   -Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort. D/C

   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension)- source unclear, likely
   intra-abdominal source, however other sources like infected CVL and
   sinuses are possible, but much less likely.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, who underwent resection and was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. She has a history of pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization, and has been intubated five times.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: intubated on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis: fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, with an unclear source, likely intra-abdominal, but other sources such as infected central venous line and sinuses are possible
* Splenic artery laceration: stable hematocrit after transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells overnight
* Cardiac arrest: probable CAD, with LV systolic dysfunction, and concern for an ischemic event as an etiology
* Acute renal failure: worsening renal function, likely ATN secondary to sepsis/hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
* Anastomotic leak: s/p gastrectomy, with episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 22.1-22.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 27.2-30.0%
* Platelet count: 467-552 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.3-3.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23-27 mmol/L
* Electrolytes: potassium 4.3-5.1 mmol/L, magnesium 1.8-2.3 mmol/L, phosphorus 4.6-5.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 119-322 mg/dL

The patient's medication regimen includes:

* Antibiotics: meropenem, linezolid, micafungin, and flagyl
* Vasopressors: dopamine and norepinephrine
* Sedatives: midazolam and fentanyl
* Pain management: fentanyl and morphine
* Antihypertensives: metoprolol and atorvastatin
* Anti-emetics: ondansetron and metoclopramide

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: continued need for mechanical ventilation, potential for ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Sepsis: progression to septic shock, organ dysfunction, and mortality
* Splenic artery laceration: further bleeding, splenic rupture, or abscess formation
* Cardiac arrest: recurrent arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure
* Acute renal failure: progression to chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis, or mortality
* Anastomotic leak: further bleeding, peritonitis, or abscess formation
* Gastrointestinal complications: bleeding, perforation, or obstruction

The patient's goals of care include ongoing discussion with the family, discussion of pain management with increased doses of fentanyl, and ongoing management of her medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications following gastric adenocarcinoma surgery, esophageal stenting, and splenic laceration. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving volume-controlled mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and hematemesis.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, and is likely experiencing an intra-abdominal source of sepsis. The JP fluid culture shows 4+ GNRs, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient has undergone embolization by interventional radiology, and her hemoglobin level appears stable at this point.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient has had a recent cardiac arrest, and telemetry monitoring has revealed episodes of atrial trigeminy and bigeminy. The patient is being held on ASA and metoprolol due to recent massive bleeding and hypotension.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and it is likely secondary to sepsis, hypotension, or contrast-induced nephropathy.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has episodes of emesis after initiation of tube feeds and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) instead of tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress, hypoxia, and potentially, cardiac arrest.
* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can progress, leading to multi-organ failure, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular failure.
* Splenic artery laceration: The patient's splenic artery laceration can lead to continued bleeding, potentially causing hypovolemic shock and death.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest can recur, leading to cardiac death or prolonged hospitalization.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease, dialysis dependence, or death.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal complications can lead to further bleeding, perforation, or abscess formation, potentially causing sepsis and multi-organ failure.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, splenic artery laceration, cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, and gastrointestinal complications. Close monitoring and management of these complications are essential to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastic CA and s/p partial gastrectomy who now has
   persistent respiratory failure, sepsis and renal failure.  We have had
   ongoing discussions with family and have considered maintaining full
   aggressive measures as long as chance of meaningful recovery persists.
   We have had full change in antibiotic therapy 48 hours ago with
   persistent fevers noted.  In this setting we have continued and
   worsening renal function noted with creatinine now approaching 4.0
   despite aggressive fluid support and she remains oliguric.
   1)RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
Patient with
   continued rise in Cr despite volume support, although, we do have both
   sepsis and hypotension contributing.  This has appearance of ATN based
   upon clinical picture with dye load required with CT scan to evaluate
   for definative treatment approach for intra-abdominal source of
   infection perhaps providing transient insult.
   -Will continue to support blood pressure
   -HCO3- as needed
   -Bladder pressure to be checked today although interventions are
   limited
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Follow ABG for titration of treatment
current settings acceptable
   3)Sepsis-Likely persistent intra-abdominal source.  Antibiotics broadly
   expanded further 2 days ago.  Do have continued slow drainage.  ID
   consulted and agreement with antibiotics provided.  Will continue with
   current course of treatment.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and she is oliguric, indicating a high risk of acute kidney injury. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and further complications if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and her ABG results indicate a need for further titration of treatment. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections may be contributing to her respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed effectively.
3. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and elevated WBC count indicate ongoing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, and respiratory failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, if not managed effectively.
5. GI tract obstruction/ileus: The patient's continued return of bilious material from her oral cavity suggests ongoing GI tract obstruction or ileus, which can lead to further complications, such as bowel perforation or necrosis, if not managed promptly.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac failure, if not managed effectively.
7. Overwhelming volume overload: The patient's fluid overload can lead to further complications, such as pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, or electrolyte imbalances, if not managed promptly.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), which indicates that the healthcare team has discussed the patient's wishes with her family and has decided that aggressive life-sustaining treatments are not in her best interest. This decision should be respected and followed accordingly.

In terms of the patient's overall prognosis, the note suggests that the patient's condition is likely to worsen, and her return to her independent life is not medically likely. This decision should be respected and followed accordingly, and the patient's family should be counseled on the patient's poor prognosis and the limitations of further treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of gastric adenocarcinoma, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. She had a pulseless VT/VF arrest, and was diagnosed with a splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and splenic artery embolization. She has been intubated multiple times due to respiratory failure, and has developed sepsis with an unclear source. She has also developed acute renal failure, and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and may worsen due to her underlying lung disease and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of a splenic laceration.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to continue, and may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of sepsis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and probable CAD make her at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's JP drain fluid culture showed 4+ GNRs, which may indicate a potential infection. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to determine the source and severity of the infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of massive bleeding and splenic laceration make her at risk for further bleeding complications.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate tube feeds and her requirement for TPN make her at risk for nutritional deficiencies.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of gastrectomy and anastomotic leak make her at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and perforation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current settings, and reassess medications that may contribute to patient agitation and discomfort.
2. Hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension, and reassess the patient's fluid status.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Meropenem and Micafungin, for coverage of ESBL Klebsiella, VRE, and antifungal coverage.
4. Continue flagyl for coverage of anaerobic organisms.
5. Monitor the patient's CVP and consider giving blood as her Hct is 26.5.
6. Trend the patient's Cr and consider bicarb if more acidotic.
7. Continue TPN, and reassess the patient's nutritional status.
8. Consider switching out lines, and add C Diff to the patient's antibiotic regimen.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiac status, and reassess her cardiac medications.
10. Continue to communicate with the family, and reassess the patient's code status and disposition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   from [**Hospital3 4838**] for esophageal stenting, initially admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for respiratory failure [**2-13**] pulmonary edema, then extubated and
   called out to medical floor.  Readmitted to MICU s/p pulseless VT/VF
   arrest, then dx w/ splenic laceration requiring massive transfusion and
   splenic artery embolization.
   .
   1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt has now been intubated 5 times (1)
   hematemasis 2) respiratory distress 3) for ERCP 4)respiratory distress
   following extubation 5) code blue/cardiac arrest with feeble
   respirations.
   - Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation at current
   settings, pt cannot tolerate PS
   - Continue to hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
   - Re-assess meds that may make contribute to patient agitaion and
   discomfort. D/C
d Reglan
   2. SEPSIS (Fever, Leukocytosis, Hypotension) - JP fluid culture with 4+
   GNRs.  Continues to have sepsis-like picture and most likely due to
   intra-abdominal source.  Also could consider infected central venous
   lines, DVT, sinuses, aspiration pneumonitis.
   -- f/u all outstanding Urine, Blood, Sputum,JP drain  fluid Cx
   --continue  Meropenem, and Micofungin for broad coverage including ESBL
   Klebsiella, VRE and antifungal coverage, now have switched to
   Vancomycin (no longer on Linezolid)
   -- continue Flagyl
   -- IVF boluses as needed for MAP>65, consider giving blood as Hct 26.5
   -- Trend CVP
   -- f/u ID recs
   -- will switch IJ to subclavian line
   -- add C Diff
   -- consider lower extremity ultrasound to r/o DVT although less likely
   to cause hypotension/leukocytosis
   3.  Splenic artery laceration s/p embolization by IR: Hct appears
   stable at this point.
   -- trend Hct
   -- Transfuse for Hct<26
   -- Maintain active T+S
   4. s/p cardiac arrest/probable CAD -- No known cardiac history but echo
   with LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD but most likely events were due to
   underlying disease.  Telemetry with episodes of atrial trigeminy and
   bigeminy.
   -- Monitor on telemetry
   -- holding ASA, [**Last Name (un) 284**] in the setting of recent massive bleeding
   -- Holding Metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   -- holding Atorvastatin due to NPO status
   -- maintain K>4, Mg>2
   6. Acute renal failure: Renal function stable at this time, likely ATN
   secondary to sepsis/ hypotension vs. contrast-induced nephropathy
   --Monitor bladder pressures
   -- monitor urine output, trend Cr
   -- maintain renal perfusion with IVF as necessary
   -- Follow lytes, ABG.  Consider bicarb if more acidotic.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various reasons, including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, and splenic laceration. The patient has a history of gastric adenocarcinoma and has undergone a gastrectomy with anastomotic leak, which has been complicated by anastomotic leak and stenting.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of respiratory failure and has required intubation multiple times.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has hypotension, with a blood pressure of 136/68 mmHg, and is receiving IV fluid boluses as needed. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL. Her urine output is 153 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Infectious status: The patient has a fever of 101.5°F and is producing bilious emesis. She has a JP drain in place, which is producing sanguinous fluid. The Gram stain of the fluid is positive for polymorphonuclear leukocytes and gram-negative rods.
* Hematologic status: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL and a hematocrit level of 27.2%.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently receiving telemetry monitoring. She has a left ventricular systolic dysfunction and is at risk for cardiac complications.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete blood count: WBC 19.4, Hct 27.2, Plt 543
* Blood chemistry: Na 138, K 3.9, Cl 105, Ca++ 8.1, Mg++ 2.2, PO4 3.6
* Liver function tests: ALT 9, AST 1, Alk Phos 168, T Bili 1.2
* Renal function tests: Cr 3.6, BUN 20
* Coagulation studies: PT 16.9, PTT 38.3, INR 1.5
* Blood cultures: Pending
* Urine cultures: Pending
* Sputum cultures: Pending
* JP drain fluid culture: 4+ GNRs

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Meropenem
* Micafungin
* Flagyl
* Lasix
* Reglan
* Protonix
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue volume-controlled mechanical ventilation
* Continue to hold Lasix in the setting of hypotension
* Re-assess medications that may contribute to patient agitation and discomfort
* Continue Meropenem and Micafungin for broad coverage
* Continue Flagyl
* IVF boluses as needed for MAP>65
* Trend CVP
* F/u ID recs
* Switch IJ to subclavian line
* Add C Diff
* Consider lower extremity ultrasound to r/o DVT
* Monitor on telemetry
* Hold ASA, Metoprolol, and Atorvastatin due to NPO status
* Maintain K>4, Mg>2
* Monitor bladder pressures
* Monitor urine output, trend Cr
* Maintain renal perfusion with IVF as necessary

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with gastic CA and s/p partial gastrectomy who now has
   persistent respiratory failure and renal failure and hypotension with
   likely persistence of intra-abdominal source but with continued
   drainage.  Concern for aspiration in the setting of continued absence
   of significant movement of GI tract forward is of substantial concern
   as well.  With continued fevers will have to consider line changes for
   persistent fevers at this time as well.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Albuterol/Atrovent
   -Continue with A/C support and FIO2 at current levels
   -Concerning for pulmonary edema
   -Will return to diuresis as blood pressure stabilizes
   -Patient now on day #9 of intubation
   2)Sepsis-
   -Micafungin/Meropenem/Vancomycin in place
   -Will re-site CVL today given persistent fevers and absence of new
   source seen
   -Appreciate all the input from ID consultants
   -GNR

   -Will work to minimize aspiration of GI contents
   3)Renal Failure-We have creatinine improving modestly but urine output
   has remained minimal.  With volume support we do have concern for
   volume overload at this time which would lead to need for consideration
   of dialysis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with gastric cancer, who underwent partial gastrectomy and is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure, renal failure, and hypotension. The patient has a high risk of developing complications, including:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to lead to pulmonary edema, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of respiratory arrest.
2. Aspiration: The patient's absence of significant movement of the GI tract forward increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and absence of a new source of infection suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving modestly, but urine output remains minimal. This may indicate ongoing renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which can lead to complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and death.
6. Volume overload: The patient's volume support may lead to volume overload, which can worsen her renal failure and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and central venous lines increase her risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent gastric ulcers, which can lead to bleeding, perforation, and death.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management. The patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Respiratory support: Continue with A/C support and FiO2 at current levels, and consider increasing the level of support if the patient's oxygenation status worsens.
2. Sepsis management: Continue with the current antibiotic regimen, and consider re-siting the central venous line if the patient's fevers persist.
3. Renal failure management: Continue with volume support, and consider initiating dialysis if the patient's creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Hyperglycemia management: Continue with insulin therapy to control the patient's blood glucose levels.
5. Volume overload management: Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and adjust her fluid management plan accordingly.
6. DVT prophylaxis: Continue with DVT prophylaxis measures, including compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: Continue with stress ulcer prophylaxis measures, including proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 blockers.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing complications, including pulmonary edema, aspiration, sepsis, renal failure, hyperglycemia, volume overload, DVT, and stress ulcer. The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent and treat these complications."
