   Chief Complaint: Acute hypoxia
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2194-10-29**] 06:57 PM
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - START [**2194-10-30**] 04:56 AM
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She cannot respond
   to questions of orientation. She had CT scan which showed LLL
   collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.  She was thought to
   be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated with ativan but
   remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short periods of
   stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.  She was
   intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood gas was
   done and was 7.34/38/130/21/-4.  Her morning Hct was 21 so she was
   transfused with 1 unit PRBC.

   Summary of HPI for morning rounds:
   87 yo F recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver
   metastases, HTN, who presented on [**2194-10-27**] after an unwitnessed fall
   and c/o R hip pain.  At baseline she is ambulatory but relies on her
   daughter for assistance with her aide for her activities of daily
   living. Per the patient's daughter she has had a slight increase in
   confusion recently.  The details of her fall are unclear.  CT-c-spine
   was without fracture.  CT head was without acute process.  Hip xray
   showed a right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur
   extending to the lesser trochanter. She was admitted to the medical
   service for further management.  She underwent open reduction and
   internal fixation of right hip fracture and closed reduction or right
   distal radius fracture. She tolerated the procedure well but had
   agitation post-operatively which was treated with IV haldol.  At
   approximately 2 PM on POD#1 she was noted to have acute hypoxia,
   tachypnea and tachycardia.  She was initially 80% on RA and this
   improved to low 90s on facemask and high 90s on a non-rebreather.
   Repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.  ABG on a
   non-breather was  7.34/34/170.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no
   other changes compared to priors.  She was transferred to the MICU for
   further management.
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She could not
   respond to questions of orientation.  She was sedated with precedex and
   a femoral line was placed d/t lack of access.  Her BP went to SBP of
   70's and she was fluid bolused with rapid response. She had CT scan
   which showed LLL collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.
   She was thought to be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated
   with ativan but remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short
   periods of stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.
   She was intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood
   gas was done.

   Urine culture from [**10-28**]:
   E. COLI
   CT CHEST w/ CONTRAST
   - Suboptimal contrast bolus to evaluate for PE. No central PE; however
   evaluation at segmental and subsegmental level is suboptimal.
   - Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for atelectasis; however
   cannot r/o
   pneumonia, or aspiration.
   - No large mucus plug seen; however if clinical concern endoscopy is
   more
   sensitive.
   - Small hiatal hernia
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old female with recently diagnosed
   pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension,
   osteoarthritis who presented on [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now
   s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and delerium.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Differential diagnosis includes
   pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, acute coronary ischemia, aspiration.
   CXR without evidence of edema or new infiltrates.  EKG without evidence
   of ischemia. Most concerning etiology at this time would be pulmonary
   or fat embolism.  CTA Chest suboptimal, but extensive LLL
   atelectasis.   Patient intubated at 5am
   - LENI
s today b/c safest study to eval for PE
   - d/t high pre-test prob and poor study, will cont. on IV heparin
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - Influenza test and start Tamiflu at 75mg daily
   - induced sputum and mini-BAL
   - bronchoscopy today to look for mucus plug
   - EKG repeat
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram given fall, murmur on exam, worsening hypoxia
   - continue ventilation w/ midaz/fentanyl drip.
   - decreased FiO2 to 70%
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up but
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced)
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 12h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood
   - gave 1 unit of blood this morning because at transfusion goal and
   resp distress
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 30
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 6h
   - transfusion goal < 21
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   #Depression:
   - continue duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - continue ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.
   - Stress dose steroids 50mg q6 hydrocortisone and fludricortisone
   0.05mg
   FEN: NPO for now, NS @ 100 cc/hr, monitor electrolytes
   Prophylaxis: IV heparin, bowel regimen, PPI
   Access: Femoral CVL, move to IJ when able to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female who was admitted to the medical service for management of a right hip fracture, distal radius fracture, and recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases. She developed acute hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia on POD#1, which was initially managed with facemask oxygen and non-rebreather mask. She was subsequently intubated and placed on CMV/Assist ventilation. The patient's blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 38, PO2 of 130, and lactate of 1.6. Her hemodynamic monitoring showed a Tmax of 37.1°C, Tcurrent of 37.1°C, HR of 115 bpm, BP of 125/42 mmHg, and SpO2 of 76%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of fall, right hip fracture, and tachypnea, PE is a potential concern. The CTA Chest showed extensive LLL atelectasis, but the study was suboptimal, making it difficult to rule out PE.
2. Fat Embolism: The patient's tachypnea and tachycardia could be related to fat embolism, which is a potential complication of trauma and fractures.
3. Aspiration: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect her airway increase the risk of aspiration.
4. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection and may be at risk for secondary infections, such as pneumonia.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely related to her recent surgery, pain, and medications.
6. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate level could be related to poor tissue perfusion, infection, or cardiac event.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to her colonic malignancy and may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and may require further evaluation and treatment.
9. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: The patient's polymyalgia rheumatica may require further evaluation and treatment, particularly given her recent steroid use.
10. Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: The patient's cancer diagnosis may require further evaluation and treatment, including consideration of MRI imaging to assess for brain lesions.

Plan:

1. Continue ventilation with midazolam and fentanyl drip.
2. Decrease FiO2 to 70%.
3. Monitor ABG whenever there is a change in respiratory status.
4. Continue to work up the patient's hypoxia, including further evaluation for PE, fat embolism, and aspiration.
5. Treat the patient's delirium with ciprofloxacin, blood cultures, and frequent reorientation.
6. Monitor the patient's lactate level and trend it q 12h.
7. Continue to follow the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation and treatment.
8. Continue to manage the patient's depression with duloxetine and ativan.
9. Consider a social work consult to discuss the patient's cancer diagnosis with her family.
10. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's polymyalgia rheumatica."

    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She cannot respond
   to questions of orientation. She had CT scan which showed LLL
   collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.  She was thought to
   be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated with ativan but
   remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short periods of
   stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.  She was
   intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood gas was
   done and was 7.34/38/130/21/-4.  Her morning Hct was 21 so she was

   Summary of HPI for morning rounds:
   87 yo F recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver
   metastases, HTN, who presented on [**2194-10-27**] after an unwitnessed fall
   and c/o R hip pain.  At baseline she is ambulatory but relies on her
   daughter for assistance with her aide for her activities of daily
   living. Per the patient's daughter she has had a slight increase in
   confusion recently.  The details of her fall are unclear.  CT-c-spine
   was without fracture.  CT head was without acute process.  Hip xray
   showed a right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur
   extending to the lesser trochanter. She was admitted to the medical
   service for further management.  She underwent open reduction and
   internal fixation of right hip fracture and closed reduction or right
   distal radius fracture. She tolerated the procedure well but had
   agitation post-operatively which was treated with IV haldol.  At
   approximately 2 PM on POD#1 she was noted to have acute hypoxia,
   tachypnea and tachycardia.  She was initially 80% on RA and this
   improved to low 90s on facemask and high 90s on a non-rebreather.
   Repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.  ABG on a
   non-breather was  7.34/34/170.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no
   other changes compared to priors.  She was transferred to the MICU for
   further management.
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She could not
   respond to questions of orientation.  She was sedated with precedex and
   a femoral line was placed d/t lack of access.  Her BP went to SBP of
   70's and she was fluid bolused with rapid response. She had CT scan
   which showed LLL collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.
   She was thought to be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated
   with ativan but remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short
   periods of stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.
   She was intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood
   gas was done.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Chief Complaint: Acute hypoxia
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2194-10-29**] 06:57 PM
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - START [**2194-10-30**] 04:56 AM
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She cannot respond
   to questions of orientation. She had CT scan which showed LLL
   collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.  She was thought to
   be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated with ativan but
   remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short periods of
   stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.  She was
   intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood gas was
   done and was 7.34/38/130/21/-4.  Her morning Hct was 21 so she was
   transfused with 1 unit PRBC.

   Summary of HPI for morning rounds:
   87 yo F recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver
   metastases, HTN, who presented on [**2194-10-27**] after an unwitnessed fall
   and c/o R hip pain.  At baseline she is ambulatory but relies on her
   daughter for assistance with her aide for her activities of daily
   living. Per the patient's daughter she has had a slight increase in
   confusion recently.  The details of her fall are unclear.  CT-c-spine
   was without fracture.  CT head was without acute process.  Hip xray
   showed a right intertrochanteric-subtrochanteric fracture of the femur
   extending to the lesser trochanter. She was admitted to the medical
   service for further management.  She underwent open reduction and
   internal fixation of right hip fracture and closed reduction or right
   distal radius fracture. She tolerated the procedure well but had
   agitation post-operatively which was treated with IV haldol.  At
   approximately 2 PM on POD#1 she was noted to have acute hypoxia,
   tachypnea and tachycardia.  She was initially 80% on RA and this
   improved to low 90s on facemask and high 90s on a non-rebreather.
   Repeat CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.  ABG on a
   non-breather was  7.34/34/170.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no
   other changes compared to priors.  She was transferred to the MICU for
   further management.
    On arrival to the MICU she is screaming her name.  She could not
   respond to questions of orientation.  She was sedated with precedex and
   a femoral line was placed d/t lack of access.  Her BP went to SBP of
   70's and she was fluid bolused with rapid response. She had CT scan
   which showed LLL collapse.   Her RR remained high d/t her agitation.
   She was thought to be in pain and was given morphine, she was sedated
   with ativan but remained agitated and tachypneic.  Even during short
   periods of stillness, her RR was in 30's and she sat'd in the 80's.
   She was intubated at about 5am and put on CMV/Assist.  A repeat blood
   gas was done.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old female with recently diagnosed
   pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension,
   osteoarthritis who presented on [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now
   s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and delerium.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Differential diagnosis includes
   pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, acute coronary ischemia, aspiration.
   CXR without evidence of edema or new infiltrates.  EKG without evidence
   of ischemia. Most concerning etiology at this time would be pulmonary
   or fat embolism.  CTA Chest suboptimal, but extensive LLL atelectasis.
     Patient intubated at 5am
   - d/t high pre-test prob and poor study, will cont. on IV heparin
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - induced sputum and mini-BAL
   - bronchoscopy today to look for mucus plug
   - EKG
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   - echocardiogram given fall, murmur on exam, worsening hypoxia
   - continue ventilation w/ midaz/fentanyl drip.  Wean as tolerates RSBI
   and SBT
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up but
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced)
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 12h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood
   - gave 1 unit of blood this morning because at transfusion goal and
   resp distress
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 6h
   - transfusion goal < 21
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   #Depression:
   - continue duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - continue ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.
   - continue prednisone 5mg daily

Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She was admitted to the MICU with acute hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia following a fall and subsequent right hip fracture. She was intubated at 5 am and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 163, indicating severe hypoxia. Her blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.34, PCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PO2 of 130 mmHg. Her lactate level has decreased from 3.5 to 1.6, but her elevated lactate level remains a concern.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of delirium. Her differential diagnosis includes infection, medications, pain, and constipation. She is currently intubated and unable to respond to questions, making it difficult to work up her delirium.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hematocrit of 21.2. She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU transfer and is currently transfused with one unit of blood.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, which is being managed with IV heparin. She is also taking medications for depression, polymyalgia rheumatica, and pancreatic/colon cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia are concerning for pulmonary embolism. A CTA chest was suboptimal, but extensive LLL atelectasis was noted.
2. Fat embolism: The patient's fall and subsequent right hip fracture increase her risk of fat embolism.
3. Aspiration: The patient's delirium and inability to protect her airway increase her risk of aspiration.
4. Infection: The patient's delirium and elevated lactate level are concerning for infection.
5. Cardiac event: The patient's elevated lactate level and decreased cardiac output may indicate a cardiac event.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as needed to improve oxygenation.
2. Monitor the patient's lactate level and trend it q 12h to assess for improvement.
3. Work up the patient's delirium with blood cultures, influenza swab, and sputum cultures.
4. Continue IV heparin to manage hypertension and prevent DVT.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider a social work consult to discuss the patient's diagnosis and treatment plan with her family.
7. Consider an MRI imaging study to assess for brain lesions if the patient's mental status does not improve.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a high pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) with a negative but suboptimal computed tomography angiogram (CTA). She has a history of hip fracture, anemia secondary to acute blood loss, and recently diagnosed metastatic cancer.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a fever of 101.8°F (38.8°C). She has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, sulfonamides, and penicillins, and is receiving a variety of medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure of 82/35 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support is being managed with a ventilator, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL, and an elevated white blood cell count of 13.7 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for ecchymosis on her right thigh, and her neurologic examination is abnormal, with no response to noxious stimuli and non-purposeful movement.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Fully culture the patient, including viral and bacterial cultures.
2. Expand antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and influenza.
3. Perform bronchoscopy to exclude endobronchial lesions and obtain additional microbiological and cytological specimens.
4. Transfuse the patient to a hemoglobin level of 30 g/dL, and consider stopping heparin if her hemoglobin level continues to fall.
5. Evaluate the patient for PE with echocardiography and lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS).
6. Consider stress dose steroids.
7. Manage the patient's pain with a trial of aggressive therapy for 2-3 days, followed by comfort-focused care if there are signs of major decompensation and setbacks.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and other infections may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and death.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's high pre-test probability for PE and negative but suboptimal CTA may indicate a high risk of PE, which can cause sudden death.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced, leading to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's invasive lines and devices may become infected, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a high pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) with a negative but suboptimal computed tomography angiogram (CTA). The patient has a history of hip fracture, recently diagnosed metastatic cancer, and anemia secondary to acute blood loss.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.8°F, heart rate 112 bpm, blood pressure 82/35 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on 80% FiO2.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving vasopressors and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 22 cmH2O.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,378 mL of fluid and has a total output of 1,385 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.
* Laboratory results: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 13.7 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's high pre-test probability for PE and negative but suboptimal CTA, there is a risk of PE development or progression.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may worsen and lead to respiratory failure or sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and white blood cell count suggest a risk of sepsis, which may worsen her condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and further deterioration may lead to the need for more aggressive respiratory support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a history of hip fracture and is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
6. Metastatic cancer progression: The patient has recently diagnosed metastatic cancer, which may worsen and lead to further complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is not receiving adequate nutrition, which may worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan should focus on:

1. Expanding antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia and influenza.
2. Performing a bronchoscopy to exclude endobronchial lesions and obtain additional microbiological and cytological specimens.
3. Transfusing blood products to correct anemia and coagulopathy.
4. Further evaluating the patient for PE, including echocardiography and leg ultrasound.
5. Stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
6. Considering resiting the femoral line to the neck, although this may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
7. Implementing stress ulcer prophylaxis and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.
8. Monitoring the patient's glycemic control and adjusting therapy as needed.
9. Providing adequate nutrition and hydration to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
10. Continuously monitoring the patient's condition and adjusting the plan as needed to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and recently diagnosed with right hip fracture. She presented with acute hypoxia and delirium and was intubated. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia may be related to a PE, which is a high-risk condition in patients with cancer and immobility.
2. Fat Embolism: The patient's fall and subsequent respiratory distress may be related to a fat embolism, which is a potential complication of long-bone fractures.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's delirium and altered mental status may increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's urinary tract infection and pneumonia may lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has a history of aortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and recent fall may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and hypovolemic shock.
8. Infection: The patient's immobility and altered mental status may increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for her various medical issues. She requires close monitoring of her oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamics to prevent respiratory and cardiac complications. She also requires treatment for her pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and anemia. The patient's family should be informed of her condition and involved in her care to ensure that her wishes are respected. A social work consult may be necessary to address the patient's psychosocial needs and to facilitate a family meeting to discuss her diagnosis and treatment options."

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   CXR [**10-30**]
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Previously seen line at the right lung apex likely represents a
   skinfold.
   If continuous clinical concern, repeat radiograph in few hours can be
   done.
   2. Retrocardiac opacification, with air bronchogram, and opacification
   at the
   left hilum, similar compared to prior radiograph, concerning for
   pneumonia.
   Stable left pleural effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 year old female with recently diagnosed
   pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension,
   osteoarthritis who presented on [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now
   s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and delerium.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Differential diagnosis includes
   pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, acute coronary ischemia, aspiration.
   CXR without evidence of edema or new infiltrates.  EKG without evidence
   of ischemia. Most concerning etiology at this time would be pulmonary
   or fat embolism.  CTA Chest suboptimal, but extensive LLL
   atelectasis.   Patient intubated at 5am
   - f/u LENI results (done b/c safest study to eval for PE
   - d/c
d IV heparin b/c no RH strain, neg CTA, and alternative dx for
   hypoxia
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - Influenza test and started Tamiflu at 75mg daily (results pending
   this am)
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD)
   - bronchoscopy yesterday- no mucus plug seen
   - EKG repeated-
   - serial cardiac enzymes show persistent troponin elevation- d/t global
   ischemia vs renal dysfunction?
   - echocardiogram done and showed LVH and  hyperdynamic.  No Rheart
   strain
   - continue ventilation w/ midaz/fentanyl drip.
   - changed to pressure support; wean from vent as tolerated
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced) all pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 24h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 30; will need to give unit of blood
   this morning
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 8h
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   .
   #Depression:
   - continue duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - continue ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She was admitted to the ICU after suffering a right hip fracture and was intubated due to acute hypoxia and delirium. The patient has a fever of 101.8°F, and her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Her echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperdynamic function, but no right heart strain. She also has a severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, tachypnea, and tachycardia could be related to a pulmonary embolism. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was suboptimal, but extensive left lower lobe atelectasis was seen.
2. Fat embolism: The patient's symptoms could also be related to a fat embolism, which is a common complication of long-bone fractures.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels and echocardiogram findings suggest possible cardiac ischemia.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's radiograph showed retrocardiac opacification and air bronchogram, which could be indicative of pneumonia.
5. Delirium: The patient's symptoms of agitation and confusion could be related to delirium, which is a common complication of critical illness.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be related to her colonic malignancy or blood loss from her hip fracture.
7. Depression: The patient's history of depression and her current symptoms of agitation and confusion suggest that she may be experiencing depression.
8. Polymyalgia Rheumatica: The patient's history of polymyalgia rheumatica and her current symptoms of pain and stiffness could be related to this condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status could deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac ischemia and hypertension could lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count could indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anemia and hypertension could lead to renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms could indicate the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide support as needed.
2. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiac status, including echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infection, including antibiotics and antiviral medications.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, including endoscopy and imaging studies.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and provide support as needed.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's anemia, including blood transfusions and iron supplementation.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's polymyalgia rheumatica, including corticosteroids and physical therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a complex medical history, including recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a history of falls.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxia and delirium after a right hip fracture. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her initial lactate level was 3.5, which has decreased to 1.6.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a CXR showing retrocardiac opacification with air bronchogram and opacification at the left hilum, which is concerning for pneumonia.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or pneumonia.
3. Delirium: The patient is agitated and unable to respond to questions, which may be related to infection, medications, pain, or constipation.
4. Elevated lactate: The patient's initial lactate level was 3.5, which has decreased to 1.6, but may still be related to poor tissue perfusion or other underlying conditions.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit and is receiving blood transfusions.
6. Pancreatic/colon cancer: The patient has recently been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon and has suspicious liver lesions.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 100s systolic, and her home antihypertensives are being held.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Treatment of pneumonia with antibiotics.
2. Management of respiratory distress with continued ventilation and ABG monitoring.
3. Work-up of delirium with frequent reorientation, encouragement of normal sleep/wake cycle, and aggressive bowel regimen.
4. Monitoring of lactate levels and blood cultures.
5. Anemia management with blood transfusions and iron supplementation.
6. Pancreatic/colon cancer management with chemotherapy and possible MRI imaging.
7. Hypertension management with anti-HTN drip and weaning from vent in the future.

The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   87 year old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with
   liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who presented on
   [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and
   delerium. Echocardiogram done and showed LVH and  hyperdynamic.  No R
   heart strain. Serial cardiac enzymes show persistent troponin
   elevation- d/t global ischemia vs renal dysfunction?
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  PE essentially ruled out (so IV
   heparin stopped), seen to have PNA on CT and clnically (fever, WBC),
   etc
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - Influenza test and started Tamiflu at 75mg daily (results pending
   this am)
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD)
   - bronchoscopy yesterday- no mucus plug seen
   - EKG repeated- no acute ischemia
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldol for
   delirium
   - keep ventilated for today
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced) all pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol as above
   - MRI in the future
   .
   #Goals of Care: Daughters had previously decided that they did not want
   to tell their mother that she has cancer.
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 25
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>30.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   - anti-HTN drip as wean from vent in future.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, who presented with a right hip fracture and acute hypoxia. She has been treated for pneumonia, and her respiratory status has been managed with ventilation. She has also been treated for delirium and has been receiving pain management with fentanyl and haloperidol. Her anemia has been managed with blood transfusions, and her hypertension has been controlled with antihypertensive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of further deterioration. The potential complications include respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, and the potential complications include sepsis, respiratory failure, and organ dysfunction.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a significant concern, and the potential complications include agitation, confusion, and increased risk of falls.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a potential complication of her underlying cancer and may lead to further deterioration in her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a potential complication of her underlying disease and may lead to further cardiovascular complications.
6. Cancer Progression: The patient's cancer is likely to progress, and the potential complications include metastases, organ dysfunction, and decreased quality of life.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly given her compromised immune system and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
8. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function are all at risk of further deterioration, and the potential complications include acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure.
9. Increased Risk of Falls: The patient's delirium and altered mental status make her at increased risk of falls, which can lead to further complications, including fractures and head trauma.
10. Decreased Quality of Life: The patient's underlying cancer and compromised medical status make her at risk of decreased quality of life, including decreased mobility, increased pain, and decreased cognitive function.

Given the patient's complex medical status and the potential complications listed above, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to ensure optimal care and management of her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a complex medical history, including recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a recent right hip fracture. The patient is currently intubated and on ventilator support due to acute respiratory failure and hypoxia.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Pneumonia is suspected, and the patient is receiving antibiotics.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. The differential diagnosis includes infection, medications, pain, and constipation.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to colonic malignancy. She has received blood transfusions and is being monitored for further anemia.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently in the 100s systolic, and there is a risk of further elevation. The patient is not receiving antihypertensive medications, and the decision to withhold them has been made due to concern for pulmonary embolism.
5. Pancreatic/colon cancer: The patient has recently been diagnosed with pancreatic/colon cancer, and her family has chosen not to disclose this information to her until a specific date. The patient's mental status is being closely monitored, and MRI imaging may be necessary in the future to assess for brain lesions.
6. Orthopedic complications: The patient has a right hip fracture and a right wrist fracture, and she is at risk for further complications, such as nonunion or malunion.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of colonic malignancy, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
8. Infection: The patient has a suspected urinary tract infection, and blood cultures are pending. There is a risk of further infection, including pneumonia or sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Aggressive care until Sunday, with a goal of extubation.
2. Treatment for pneumonia with antibiotics.
3. Management of delirium with medications and frequent reorientation.
4. Monitoring of anemia and blood transfusions.
5. Management of hypertension with close monitoring and potential use of antihypertensive medications.
6. Palliative care for the patient's pancreatic/colon cancer.
7. Monitoring of orthopedic complications and potential need for further surgery.
8. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal complications and potential need for further treatment.
9. Infection control measures, including antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for signs of sepsis.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic and colon cancer, liver metastases, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She presented with a right hip fracture, acute hypoxia, and delirium. She was intubated and diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is being treated with cefipime and vancomycin. Her delirium is being managed with haloperidol and fentanyl. She has a history of fall, and her family does not want her to know about her cancer diagnosis. The patient's condition is stable, but she has been experiencing tachycardia, hypertension, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and weaning from the ventilator is a priority. However, the patient's underlying condition and the presence of pneumonia may make it challenging to extubate her.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has HAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. The presence of pneumonia may prolong her hospital stay and increase the risk of further complications.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a significant concern, and it is essential to manage it effectively to prevent further complications. The use of haloperidol and fentanyl may help to calm the patient, but the patient's family may need to be involved in the decision-making process.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a concern, and it may be related to her underlying cancer diagnosis. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage her anemia.
5. Pancreatic and Colon Cancer: The patient's cancer diagnosis is a significant concern, and it may affect her prognosis. The patient's family may need to be involved in the decision-making process regarding her treatment and care.
6. Fall Risk: The patient's fall risk is high, and it is essential to take measures to prevent further falls. The patient's orthostatic blood pressure should be monitored regularly, and she should be encouraged to move slowly and carefully to avoid further falls.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, and it may be related to her underlying condition. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage her hypertension.
8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is a concern, and it may be related to her underlying condition. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to manage her tachycardia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and wean her from the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with haloperidol and fentanyl as necessary.
3. Evaluate and treat the patient's anemia as necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics as necessary.
5. Involve the patient's family in the decision-making process regarding her treatment and care.
6. Monitor the patient's fall risk and take measures to prevent further falls.
7. Monitor the patient's hypertension and tachycardia and treat as necessary.
8. Consider MRI imaging to assess for brain lesions and other potential complications.
9. Continue to provide aggressive pain management to the patient, which is high risk due to unstabilized hip fx."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 year old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with
   liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who presented on
   [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and
   delerium. Echocardiogram done and showed LVH and  hyperdynamic.  No R
   heart strain. Serial cardiac enzymes show persistent troponin
   elevation- d/t global ischemia vs renal dysfunction?
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  PE essentially ruled out (so IV
   heparin stopped), seen to have PNA on CT and clnically (fever, WBC),
   etc
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - Influenza test and started Tamiflu at 75mg daily (results pending
   this am)
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD)
   - bronchoscopy yesterday- no mucus plug seen
   - EKG repeated- no acute ischemia
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldol for
   delirium
   - keep ventilated for today
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced) all pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol as above
   - MRI in the future
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 24h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 25
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 8h
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   - anti-HTN drip as wean from vent in future.
   .
   #Depression:
   - stop duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - stopped ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 year old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with
   liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who presented on
   [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and
   delerium. Echocardiogram done and showed LVH and  hyperdynamic.  No R
   heart strain. Serial cardiac enzymes show persistent troponin
   elevation- d/t global ischemia vs renal dysfunction?
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  PE essentially ruled out (so IV
   heparin stopped), seen to have PNA on CT and clnically (fever, WBC),
   etc
   - treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc/Cipro for Gm+, -, and double pseudomonas
   - Influenza test and started Tamiflu at 75mg daily (results pending
   this am)
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD)
   - bronchoscopy yesterday- no mucus plug seen
   - EKG repeated- no acute ischemia
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldol for
   delirium
   - keep ventilated for today
   -ABG
s whenever change in resp status
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infection
   - blood cultures pending
   - influenza swab; sputum cultures (induced) all pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol as above
   - MRI in the future
   .
   #Elevated Lactate:  Lactate on arrival was 3.5, now 1.6. Initial
   concern that this may be related to poor tissue perfusion either from
   surgery, infection, pulmonary embolism or cardiac event.
   - follow blood cultures
   - trend lactate q 24h
   - workup of hypoxia as above
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - give blood with goal of Hct of 25
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q 8h
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - consider social work consult
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Hypertension:  Blood pressures currently in 100s systolic. Given
   concern for pulmonary embolism will hold home antihypertensives.
   - holding home metoprolol
   - anti-HTN drip as wean from vent in future.
   .
   #Depression:
   - stop duloxetine 60 mg daily
   - stopped ativan 0.5 mg PO QID:PRN
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of pancreatic and colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a history of falls. She was admitted with right hip fracture and acute hypoxia. She has been treated for pneumonia, anemia, and delirium. She has multiple comorbidities and is at risk for various complications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. Her recent CXR shows worsening left perihilar consolidation and nearly total right lower lobe collapse.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. The risk of pneumonia is increased due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications such as falls, aspiration, and respiratory failure.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac conditions.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
6. Cancer progression: The patient has recently diagnosed pancreatic and colon cancer, which can progress rapidly and worsen her overall condition.
7. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can spread to other parts of her body and worsen her condition.
8. Blood clotting disorders: The patient has a history of falls, which can increase her risk of blood clotting disorders, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, which can increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk of nutritional deficiencies due to her prolonged hospitalization and lack of oral intake.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and monitor for signs of improvement.
2. Continue treatment for delirium, including frequent reorientation, aggressive bowel regimen, and Haldol.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adjusting her antihypertensive medication as needed.
5. Consider MRI imaging to assess for brain lesions and monitor the patient's mental status.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider weaning her from mechanical ventilation if possible.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider tube feeds if necessary.
8. Consider stress dose steroids if the patient's stress levels increase.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider adjusting her antihypertensive medication as needed.
10. Consider a social work consult to discuss the patient's end-of-life care and advance care planning."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a complex medical history, including recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a history of falls. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and hypoxia.

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, and cultures are pending.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion, making it difficult to assess her mental status.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is low, and she has received three units of packed red blood cells prior to MICU transfer.
4. Fractures: The patient has suffered two fractures, one in her right hip and one in her right wrist, which are being managed by the orthopedic team.
5. Cancer: The patient has recently been diagnosed with pancreatic/colon cancer and has suspicious liver lesions.
6. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression, but the medication has been stopped due to her current mental status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, making it difficult to manage her pain and anxiety.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as heart failure or shock.
5. Fractures: The patient's fractures may not heal properly, leading to further complications such as infection or non-union.
6. Cancer: The patient's cancer may progress, leading to further complications such as metastases or organ failure.

The patient's family has made it clear that they do not want to be informed about her cancer diagnosis, and the healthcare team must balance their desire for honesty with the patient's right to know about her condition. The patient's code status is DNR, and she is not a candidate for aggressive treatment. The healthcare team must prioritize her comfort and quality of life while also managing her complex medical condition."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ETT was pulled back 2 cm because low in CXR
   - Patient not tolerating lowering of sedation.  Was agitated and
   hypertensive all day despite labetolol, amlodipine.  At shift change,
   increased fentanyl because believe this to be d/t pain and gave dose of
   Zyprexa SL and patient seemed to respond well to this.  BP of 100-120's
   after that rather than 180-200.
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] had meeting with family to update them on patient
   - Cipro was d/c because did not believe it was adding anything to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint: Acute mental status change s/p fall
   24 Hour Events:
   - ETT was pulled back 2 cm because low in CXR
   - Patient not tolerating lowering of sedation.  Was agitated and
   hypertensive all day despite labetolol, amlodipine.  At shift change,
   increased fentanyl because believe this to be d/t pain and gave dose of
   Zyprexa SL and patient seemed to respond well to this.  BP of 100-120's
   after that rather than 180-200.
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] had meeting with family to update them on patient
   - Cipro was d/c because did not believe it was adding anything to
   therapy and could be contributory to delirium
   - WBC climbing again, sent a diff for the morning.  No associated

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female who was admitted with a right hip fracture and subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing worsening bibasilar opacifications on chest X-ray, which may indicate a hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing delirium, which is being treated with haloperidol and fentanyl.

The patient has a history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, and is taking multiple medications, including pantoprazole, midazolam, and lorazepam.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening anemia, with a hematocrit of 27.9%. She has received three units of packed red blood cells prior to MICU transfer.

The patient's family has not been told about her cancer diagnosis, and the physician is working with palliative care to address this issue.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening bibasilar opacifications on chest X-ray may indicate a hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's delirium and worsening anemia may indicate a systemic inflammatory response, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and history of aortic sclerosis may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium and history of polymyalgia rheumatica may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

The patient's code status is DNR, and the physician is working with the family to address their goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with
   liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis who presented on
   [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and
   delirium, intubated. Testing negative for PE.  Plan now is for
   aggressive care until Sunday with goal of extubation
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Found to have hospital-acquired
   pneumonia on CT.  DFA negative for flu, but cultures pending.  No mucus
   plug on bronch.
   - continue to treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc; day [**3-18**]
   - change vanc to q 24h rather than q48 h b/c of improving renal
   function
   - stop tamiflu and d/c precautions for influenza
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD) culture
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldo/zyprexal for
   delirium
   - attempt to extubate today; family meeting about re-intubation if
   fails extubation
   .
   #Delerium:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary
   tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated
   and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult
   to work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli
   - blood cultures pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol changed to Zyprexa 10mg [**Hospital1 **] as worked much better for patient
   agitation
   - MRI in the future possibly
   .
   #Goals of Care: Daughters had previously decided that they did not want
   to tell their mother that she has cancer.
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - daughter would not like patient to receive further blood.
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>25.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Depression:
   - stop duloxetine 60 mg daily b/c cannot be crushed
   - started Zyprexa and tolerated well.
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.
   - Stress dose steroids 50mg q6 hydrocortisone and fludricortisone
   0.05mg changed to 25mg hydrocortisone q6hours, and continue same dose
   fludricortisone.  Wean further tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Acute mental status change s/p fall
   24 Hour Events:
   - ETT was pulled back 2 cm because low in CXR
   - Patient not tolerating lowering of sedation.  Was agitated and
   hypertensive all day despite labetolol, amlodipine.  At shift change,
   increased fentanyl because believe this to be d/t pain and gave dose of
   Zyprexa SL and patient seemed to respond well to this.  BP of 100-120's
   after that rather than 180-200.
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] had meeting with family to update them on patient
   - Cipro was d/c because did not believe it was adding anything to
   therapy and could be contributory to delirium
   - WBC climbing again, sent a diff for the morning.  No associated
   fever.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 87-year-old female who was admitted with a right hip fracture, acute hypoxia, and delirium. She has a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's recent events include:

* ETT was pulled back 2 cm due to low CXR
* Patient not tolerating lowering of sedation, was agitated and hypertensive all day
* Increased fentanyl and gave a dose of Zyprexa SL, which seemed to respond well
* Cipro was discontinued due to no added benefit and potential contribution to delirium
* WBC count is climbing again, with no associated fever

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 99 bpm (74-114 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 161/90 mmHg (103-140/56-163 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC count: 23.8 K/uL
* Hct: 30.5%
* Platelet count: 238
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show worsening bibasilar opacifications and left lower lobe collapse on CXR.

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* Hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Delirium
* Pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases
* Anemia
* Depression
* Polymyalgia rheumatica

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue treatment for PNA with Cefipime/Vanc
* Change Vanc to q24h due to improving renal function
* Stop Tamiflu and discontinue influenza precautions
* Perform induced sputum and mini-BAL culture
* Continue ventilation with fentanyl drip for pain and haloperidol/zyprexa for delirium
* Attempt to extubate today and discuss re-intubation if unsuccessful
* Monitor hematocrit q12h with a goal Hct > 25%
* Consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status to assess for brain lesions
* Palliative care involvement

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis due to hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Respiratory failure due to worsening lung collapse
* Delirium due to infection, medications, pain, or constipation
* Anemia due to colonic malignancy
* Depression due to chronic illness and treatment
* Polymyalgia rheumatica exacerbation due to stress
* Worsening of liver metastases due to cancer progression

As a medical specialist, I would recommend close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications early on. Additionally, I would recommend adjusting the patient's treatment plan as needed to address any emerging issues and optimize their care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer, admitted after a fall and hip fracture. She has post-operative pneumonia (PNA) and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. She was agitated yesterday, but was calmed with increased fentanyl and addition of zyprexa. Today, she is calm and responding to questions. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 135/56 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 10 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a FiO2 of 40%. Her physical examination reveals a thin, anxious patient with right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions, and may require further adjustments to her ventilator settings or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's PNA and rising white blood cell count may indicate the development of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may be a sign of underlying sepsis, metabolic disorders, or medication side effects, which could worsen her condition if not addressed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen her cardiac condition and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be exacerbated by her underlying conditions, such as cancer and chronic steroid use, and may require transfusions.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's edema and skin lesions may increase her risk of skin breakdown and infection.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's PNA may worsen her respiratory failure and increase her risk of respiratory complications.
8. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer may progress and worsen her overall condition, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal distension and possible bowel obstruction may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac condition and hypertension may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer, admitted after a fall and hip fracture. She has post-operative pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring ventilator support.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (normal range 74-112 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 135/56 mmHg (normal range 92-140/56-163 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 10 inspirations per minute (normal range 7-20 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 23.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 242 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Thin, anxious, and agitated
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds and rhythm
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds and good air movement
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present, and distended
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema (2+), left lower extremity edema (2+)
* Skin: Warm, with ecchymoses
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to questions with head movements

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but her SpO2 is 98%, indicating potential hypoxia.
* Pneumonia: The patient has post-operative pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.
* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a rising WBC count, indicating potential sepsis.
* Delirium: The patient is agitated and has a history of chronic steroids for PMR, which can contribute to delirium.
* Metastatic disease: The patient has metastatic colon and pancreatic cancer, which can lead to widespread organ dysfunction and death.
* Hip fracture: The patient has a right distal radius fracture and a hip fracture, which can lead to further complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
* Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is not explicitly stated, but her history of post-operative pneumonia and respiratory failure may indicate malnutrition.
* Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are not explicitly stated, but her history of post-operative pneumonia and respiratory failure may indicate hyperglycemia.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, nutrition, and glycemic control. She also requires continued treatment for her pneumonia and metastatic disease."

   [**2194-10-27**] with right hip fracture now s/p ORIF with acute hypoxia and
   delirium, intubated. Testing negative for PE.  Now extubated, plan is
   to return to home/hospice for palliative care of metastatic pancreatic
   ca.
   .
   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Found to have hospital-acquired
   pneumonia on CT.  DFA negative for flu, but cultures pending.  No mucus
   plug on bronch.
   - continue to treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc; day [**4-17**]
   - change vanc to q 24h rather than q48 h b/c of improving renal
   function
   - stop tamiflu and d/c precautions for influenza
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD) culture
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldo/zyprexal for
   delirium
   - attempt to extubate today; family meeting about re-intubation if
   fails extubation
   .
   # Leukocytosis: On stress-dose steroids, but leukocytosis started
   afterwards.
   - wean steroids back to home dose of 5mg prednisone daily.
   - pan-culture today.
   .
   #Delerium/agitation:  On Zyprexa 10mg TID w/ improved agitation but
   persistently altered mental status.
   Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary tract
   infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated and
   unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult to
   work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli
   - blood cultures pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol changed to Zyprexa 10mg [**Hospital1 **] as worked much better for patient
   agitation
   - MRI in the future possibly
   .
   #Goals of Care: Daughters had previously decided that they did not want
   to tell their mother that she has cancer.
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 9386**]ram in [**2187**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - PT consult when stable
   - orthostatics when stable
   .
   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - daughter would not like patient to receive further blood.
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>25.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting
   .
   #Depression:
   - stop duloxetine 60 mg daily b/c cannot be crushed
   - started Zyprexa and tolerated well.
   .
   #Polymyalgia Rheumatica:  Unclear details.  Per OMR she is on 1 mg
   prednisone daily but per assisted lving she is on prednisone 10 mg QAM
   and 1 mg QPM.  On chronic steroids and now has significant stress.
   - Stress dose steroids 50mg q6 hydrocortisone and fludricortisone
   0.05mg changed to 25mg hydrocortisone q6hours, and continue same dose
   fludricortisone.  Wean further tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   persistently altered mental status.
   Differential diagnosis includes infection (known urinary tract
   infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently agitated and
   unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so difficult to
   work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli
   - blood cultures pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol changed to Zyprexa 10mg [**Hospital1 **] as worked much better for patient
   agitation

   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - daughter would not like patient to receive further blood.
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>25.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a complex medical history, including recently diagnosed pancreatic and colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and a recent hip fracture. She was intubated and treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but has now been extubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on room air with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has a history of pneumonia and is being treated with cefipime and vancomycin.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 165/83 mmHg, and her heart rate is 96 beats per minute. She has a history of hypertension.
* Neurological: The patient is agitated and unable to respond to questions. She has a history of delirium and is being treated with zyprexa and haloperidol.
* Hematological: The patient's hemoglobin is 11.1 g/dL, and her platelet count is 238 x 10^9/L. She has a history of anemia and has received three units of packed red blood cells.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen is 23 mg/dL. She has a history of chronic kidney disease.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she has a history of pneumonia. She may be at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygenation and ventilation status worsen.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she has a history of hypertension. She may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or myocardial infarction.
* Neurological complications: The patient is agitated and unable to respond to questions. She may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or worsening delirium.
* Hematological complications: The patient's hemoglobin is low, and she has a history of anemia. She may be at risk for hematological complications such as bleeding or worsening anemia.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and she has a history of chronic kidney disease. She may be at risk for renal complications such as acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological, and renal status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Hypoxia, respiratory distress: Patient with hypoxia, tachypnea and
   tachycardia POD #1 from hip fracture.  Found to have hospital-acquired
   pneumonia on CT.  DFA negative for flu, but cultures pending.  No mucus
   plug on bronch.
   - continue to treat for PNA: Cefipime/Vanc; day [**3-18**]
   - change vanc to q 24h rather than q48 h b/c of improving renal
   function
   - stop tamiflu and d/c precautions for influenza
   - f/u induced sputum and mini-BAL (NTD) culture
   - continue ventilation w/ fentanyl drip for pain and haldo/zyprexal for
   delirium
   - attempt to extubate today; family meeting about re-intubation if
   fails extubation
   .
   #Delerium/agitation:  Differential diagnosis includes infection (known
   urinary tract infection), medications, pain, constipation.  Currently
   agitated and unable to respond to questions.  Currently intubated, so
   difficult to work-up until extubated.
   - cefepime for pan-sensitive for Ecoli
   - blood cultures pending
   - frequent reorientation, encourage normal sleep/wake cycle when not on
   vent
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - Haldol changed to Zyprexa 10mg [**Hospital1 **] as worked much better for patient
   agitation
   - MRI in the future possibly
   .
   #Goals of Care: Daughters had previously decided that they did not want
   to tell their mother that she has cancer.
   .
   #s/p Fall: Unwitnessed fall.  Differential diagnosis includes syncope
   versus mechanical fall.  Patient with aortic sclerosis and 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **]

   #R hip/wrist fractures: Pt has R Colles fracture and R hip fracture.
   Being followed by ortho.
   - f/u ortho recs
   - pain control with 2-4 mg IV morphine Q4H:PRN when not on vent,
   fentanyl when on vent.
   .
   #Anemia: On admission patient's hematocrit was 23.6 with iron studies
   notable for low iron and ferritin.  Likely related to colonic
   malignancy.  She has received three units of PRBCs prior to MICU
   transfer with hematocrit 28.3 post-operatively.   Stool guaiac
   positive, but no gross blood.
   - daughter would not like patient to receive further blood.
   - will continue pantoprazole 40 mg PO BID
   - monitor hematocrit q12h with goal Hct>25.
   .
   #Pancreatic/Colon Cancer: Pt was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
   of the colon on biopsy.  She has suspicious liver lesions as well as a
   mass in the head of the pancreas concerning for second primary.  She
   has not been told yet, as her family would like to withhold the
   information until [**Holiday 2419**].
   - Palliative care involved.
   - will need to consider MRI imaging if no improvement in mental status
   to assess for brain lesions
   - family meeting

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of pancreatic/colon cancer with liver metastases, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. She was admitted with a right hip fracture and acute hypoxia, and was intubated. She was extubated and now requires palliative care for her metastatic pancreatic cancer. She has been experiencing delirium, agitation, and pain, and has been treated with various medications. She has a history of anemia, and her family does not want her to receive further blood transfusions. She has also been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory distress put her at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection and pneumonia increase her risk for developing further infections.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium and agitation could worsen if not properly managed.
4. Pain: The patient's pain from her hip fracture and other medical conditions needs to be managed effectively to prevent worsening of her condition.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not properly managed, and her family's refusal to accept further blood transfusions may lead to complications.
6. Cancer Progression: The patient's metastatic pancreatic cancer could progress and spread to other parts of her body, leading to further complications.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and fluid disorder could worsen if not properly managed.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen and lead to complications if not properly managed.
9. Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity could be compromised if not properly managed, leading to further complications.
10. Confusion: The patient's confusion and disorientation could worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The 87-year-old woman with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer, s/p hip fracture with repair, is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She has a history of respiratory failure, and her respiratory status has improved. However, she remains at risk for respiratory complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 180/78 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 264 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.03
* Troponin-T: 0.03
* Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for hypernatremia (147 mEq/L)
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: The patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. She is oriented to herself only, and movement and tone are not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she remains at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, aspiration, and respiratory failure.
2. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia (147 mEq/L) requires close monitoring and treatment.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and positive cultures for C. diff require further investigation and treatment.
4. Delirium: The patient's disorientation and decreased level of consciousness increase the risk of delirium and confusion.
5. Skin integrity: The patient's skin is not assessed, and there is a risk of impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and medical devices.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not treated promptly.
7. Pain control: The patient requires effective pain management to prevent pain-related complications.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, I recommend:

1. Continued respiratory support and monitoring.
2. Electrolyte imbalance treatment, including repletion of water with D5W.
3. Further investigation and treatment of infection, including C. diff.
4. Delirium and confusion management, including stress steroids and behavioral interventions.
5. Skin integrity management, including regular skin assessment and prevention of pressure ulcers.
6. Anemia treatment, including transfusion therapy if necessary.
7. Effective pain management, including a multidisciplinary approach to pain control."
