   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent history of wound dehiscence and resection of a right lower lobe mass. She was admitted to the ICU due to tachypnea, hypotension, and altered mental status.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm (normal range: 78-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/69 mmHg (normal range: 110-134/87 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal range: 14-19 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is significant for coarse breath sounds bilaterally, a regular rate and rhythm, and a soft, non-tender abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 17.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 426 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.18 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24 mmHg
* Glucose: 166 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.5/44.7/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 103/9/0.18, ALT/AST: 54/134, Alk Phos/T Bili: 732/0.3, Differential-Neuts: 87.7%, Lymph: 9.1%, Mono: 3.0%, Eos: 0.1%, Lactic Acid: 1.2 mmol/L, LDH: 321 IU/L, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. The differential diagnosis for desaturation includes adenosine, pleural effusions, mass, possible PE, and possible infection.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation, which may be related to pulmonary pathology.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, elevated lactate, and white blood cell count.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 17.6 K/uL, which is likely related to an underlying infection.
5. Lung cancer: The patient has a history of poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer, which is likely to be recurrent.
6. PVD: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, which may be related to her current hypotension.
7. DM2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which may be contributing to her hyperglycemia.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which may be related to her current altered mental status.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may be contributing to her fatigue and weakness.
10. Wound infection: The patient has a history of wound infection, which may be related to her current sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Treatment of potential infections
2. Correction of hypernatremia
3. Weaning off sedation as appropriate
4. Respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and weaning
5. Cardiac support, including anticoagulation and management of atrial fibrillation
6. Management of hypotension, including IV fluids and pressors as needed
7. Monitoring of urine output and electrolytes
8. Oncology consult and consideration of CT-guided biopsy and thoracentesis
9. Goal of care discussion with the patient and family
10. Consideration of thoracentesis to rule out pleural effusion."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated lactate, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and the presence of a pleural effusion.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be complicated by multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's new onset atrial fibrillation and elevated lactate levels increase her risk for pulmonary embolism.
4. Malignancy: The patient's lung cancer has invaded the liver and pleural effusions, and there is concern for recurrence.
5. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure could be caused by infection, which could be complicated by sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure could be caused by neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or meningitis.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   now intubated.
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, sepsis, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection. Ddx for desaturation include adenosine, pleural effusions,
   mass, possible PE, possible infection (?empyema, less likely PNA)
   - wean vent and SBT if tolerates; RISBI 70
   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative.
   - heparin gtt for ?PE; f/u final CTA read
   - consider thoracentesis in a.m. with pleural fluid studies
   # New onset atrial fibrillation: Etiology includes pulmonary pathology.
   Mass and effusion have been present for a while and would not explain a
   fib unless an additional pulmonary process was present, i.e. PE.
   - awaiting CTA final read
   - anticoagulate with heparin gtt until CTA negative
   - full echo in a.m.
   # Hypotension: afib with RVR, elevated lactate/WBCs but this likely
   represents underlying tumor burden and the effect of HypoTN
   - IVF and pressor as needed to keep MAP > 60; will wean today
   - monitor urine output
   - treat afib with RVR
   # Leukocytosis: with left shift but stable.
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.
   - goal of care discussion
   - if desired, will proceed with CT guided biopsy and thoracentesis
   - oncology consult
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass and wound infection.
   # DM2:
   - insulin s.s.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - continue levothyroxine
   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 69F DM, lung ca s/p RLLectomy, PVD c
   complicated RLE BPG c/b infection p/w AF c RVR, hyptension, respiratory
   failure after one day at rehab. Patient developed AF c RVR during
   recent hospitalization, rx metoprolol; recurrent episode yesterday.
   Confused and hypotensive in NSR in ED after adenosine, developed
   recurrent RVR to 170, intubated. Eval notable for B effusions (L>R),
   lung / liver mass. Ecoh (bedside) s effusion or RV strain. Rx o/n with
   levophed and 4L NS.

   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with wean of vent to PSV
   [**11-17**] now with SBT this PM. Unclear the degree to which large L effusion
   is contributing to resp failure
 for now will continue to treat
   possible PE and PNA while attempting to wean vent. Will continue
   antibiotics for component of nosocomial pneumonia, check sputum and d/c
   at 48h if cx if negative. For recent onset of AF, continue heparin,
   check echo for ? effusion and LUE usg for ?clot, and start digoxin with
   close monitoring of creatinine. Troponin up in the setting of
   increased, will cycle and f/u EKG. Will try to start low dose BBL as
   able based on BP. Will monitor LFT abnormalities. Will attempt PICC and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease. She was recently discharged from a vascular service to a rehabilitation facility, but was readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, and hypotension.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 358. She has a large mass at the right base of her lung, which is invading the hemidiaphragm and causing cortical disruption of the adjacent rib and bony destruction.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response. She has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and is at risk for stroke.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 17.6 x 10^9/L and a lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. Her blood glucose level is 166 mg/dL, and her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.1 mmol/L and a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes insulin, metoprolol, and heparin, among others. She is also receiving empiric antibiotics for possible infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Management of respiratory failure with weaning of mechanical ventilation and use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
2. Treatment of atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation and rate control.
3. Management of sepsis with antibiotics and source control.
4. Treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin.
5. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and correction of abnormalities.
6. Evaluation of the large mass at the right base of the lung with computed tomography (CT) scan and possible biopsy.
7. Consideration of thoracentesis to drain the pleural effusion.
8. Evaluation of the patient's cardiac function with echocardiogram.
9. Monitoring of the patient's neurologic status and management of any changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to worsening lung disease or pleural effusion.
2. Cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias, due to atrial fibrillation.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infection.
4. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes or medication.
5. Electrolyte imbalances due to kidney disease or medication.
6. Worsening of the large mass at the right base of the lung, potentially leading to respiratory failure or cardiac complications.
7. Development of a pulmonary embolism or other thrombotic complications due to atrial fibrillation and immobility.
8. Development of a nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and immobility.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her plan of care accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection.  Attempted to extubate her on [**5-4**] but failed spontaneous
   breathing trial secondary to tachypnea.  Empirically treating for
   pneumonia but awaiting negative cultures x 48 hours.  Left pleural
   effusion also contributing to respiratory failure.  Chest CTA shows
   likely chronic thrombosis in right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
   - wean vent and SBT if tolerates
   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative for
   48 hours.
   - heparin gtt for ?PE; f/u final CTA read
   - consider thoracentesis with pleural fluid studies
   # Hypotension: afib with RVR, elevated lactate/WBCs initially but this
   likely represents underlying tumor burden and the effect of HypoTN.
   Baseline SBP in 90s per report.  UOP > 50 cc/hr.
   - continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ECHO shows severe RV
   dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**],
   and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented on in recent
   ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely secondary to (1)
   ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease and (2) chronic
   PEs with RV strain.  No evidence of acute, hemodynamically significant
   PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely secondary to structural heart
   disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop leak likely secondary to demand
   in the setting of RVR.
   - cont digoxin
   - heparin gtt for atrial fib
   - may benefit from ACEi for afterload reduction
   - likely preload dependent given RV failure
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, sepsis, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Pulse previously not doplerable,
   thought to represent traumatic arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial
   line attempt.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - goal of care discussion
   - if desired, will proceed with CT guided biopsy and thoracentesis
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - insulin s.s.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection.  Attempted to extubate her on [**5-4**] but failed spontaneous
   breathing trial secondary to tachypnea.  Empirically treating for
   pneumonia but awaiting negative cultures x 48 hours.  Left pleural

   - continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ECHO shows severe RV
   dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**],
   and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented on in recent
   ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely secondary to (1)
   ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease and (2) chronic
   PEs with RV strain.  No evidence of acute, hemodynamically significant
   PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely secondary to structural heart
   disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop leak likely secondary to demand
   in the setting of RVR.

   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Pulse previously not doplerable,
   thought to represent traumatic arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial
   line attempt.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, and PVD s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia, pleural effusion, and chronic thrombosis in the right middle lobe pulmonary artery.

The patient's hypotension is thought to be secondary to afib with RVR, elevated lactate, and WBCs, likely representing underlying tumor burden and the effect of hypotension. The patient's systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation are attributed to ischemic heart disease, chronic PEs with RV strain, and structural heart disease.

The patient's altered mental status is unclear, but may be related to metabolic encephalopathy, sun-downing, sepsis, and malignancy with potential leptomeningeal metastasis.

The patient has several comorbidities, including PVD s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound infection, DM2, depression, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and she may require ongoing mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and elevated lactate and WBCs suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation can lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart block, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulation therapy.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion increase the risk of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Organ failure: The patient's underlying comorbidities, such as PVD and DM2, may increase the risk of organ failure, particularly kidney or liver failure.
7. Malignancy progression: The patient's lung cancer may progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

Based on this assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Treat potential infections, including pneumonia and pleural effusion.
4. Manage the patient's blood sugar levels and electrolytes carefully.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Consider imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, to evaluate the patient's lung cancer and potential metastases.
7. Discuss the patient's goals of care with her family and healthcare providers to ensure that her treatment plan aligns with her wishes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and critical limb ischemia. She has been experiencing severe abdominal pain, which has been ongoing since her vascular admission. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin levels, indicating potential cardiac and inflammatory issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest potential sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias and elevated troponin levels indicate potential cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
4. Worsening peripheral vascular disease: The patient's critical limb ischemia and chronic right PE could worsen, leading to further tissue damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and potential gastrointestinal bleeding could worsen, leading to further complications and potential organ failure.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and tubes increase her risk of developing infections, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressors indicate potential hemodynamic instability, which could worsen her condition.
8. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels and potential sepsis could lead to organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular failure.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardiology consultation for further evaluation and management.
3. Consider starting antibiotics to cover potential sepsis and infection.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's peripheral vascular disease and consider further interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy or surgical intervention.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider further evaluation and management for potential gastrointestinal complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and consider adjusting her vasopressor therapy as needed.
7. Consider consultation with other specialties, such as cardiology, gastroenterology, and infectious disease, to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection.  Attempted to extubate her on [**5-4**] but failed spontaneous
   breathing trial secondary to tachypnea.  Empirically treating for
   pneumonia but awaiting negative cultures x 48 hours.  Left pleural
   effusion also contributing to respiratory failure.  Chest CTA shows
   likely chronic thrombosis in right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
   - wean vent and SBT if tolerates
   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative for
   48 hours.
   - heparin gtt for ?PE; f/u final CTA read
   - consider thoracentesis with pleural fluid studies
   # Hypotension: afib with RVR, elevated lactate/WBCs initially but this
   likely represents underlying tumor burden and the effect of HypoTN.
   Baseline SBP in 90s per report.  UOP > 50 cc/hr.
   - continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ECHO shows severe RV
   dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**],
   and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented on in recent
   ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely secondary to (1)
   ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease and (2) chronic
   PEs with RV strain.  No evidence of acute, hemodynamically significant
   PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely secondary to structural heart
   disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop leak likely secondary to demand
   in the setting of RVR.
   - cont digoxin
   - heparin gtt for atrial fib
   - may benefit from ACEi for afterload reduction
   - likely preload dependent given RV failure
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, sepsis, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Pulse previously not doplerable,
   thought to represent traumatic arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial
   line attempt.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - goal of care discussion
   - if desired, will proceed with CT guided biopsy and thoracentesis
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - insulin s.s.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD s/p RLE bypass
   grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from vascular
   service to rehab presented with afib with RVR, tachypnea, hypotension;
   intubated for hypoxia and airway protection.
   # Respiratory failure: Currently intubated [**1-15**] desaturation and a/w
   protection.  Attempted to extubate her on [**5-4**] but failed spontaneous
   breathing trial secondary to tachypnea.  Empirically treating for
   pneumonia but awaiting negative cultures x 48 hours.  Left pleural
   effusion also contributing to respiratory failure.  Chest CTA shows
   likely chronic thrombosis in right middle lobe pulmonary artery.
   - wean vent and SBT if tolerates
   - sputum cx and bcx
   - empiric vanco and pip-tazo, although infection appears less likely.
   Given overall burden of disease will continue abx until cx negative for
   48 hours.
   - heparin gtt for ?PE; f/u final CTA read
   - consider thoracentesis with pleural fluid studies
   # Hypotension: afib with RVR, elevated lactate/WBCs initially but this
   likely represents underlying tumor burden and the effect of HypoTN.
   Baseline SBP in 90s per report.  UOP > 50 cc/hr.
   - continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ECHO shows severe RV
   dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**],
   and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented on in recent
   ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely secondary to (1)
   ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease and (2) chronic
   PEs with RV strain.  No evidence of acute, hemodynamically significant
   PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely secondary to structural heart
   disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop leak likely secondary to demand
   in the setting of RVR.
   - cont digoxin
   - heparin gtt for atrial fib
   - may benefit from ACEi for afterload reduction
   - likely preload dependent given RV failure
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, sepsis, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   - treat potential infections
   - correct hypernatremia
   - wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Pulse previously not doplerable,
   thought to represent traumatic arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial
   line attempt.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - continue heparin gtt
   - vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - goal of care discussion
   - if desired, will proceed with CT guided biopsy and thoracentesis
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. She was intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a chronic right pulmonary embolism (PE) and a right subclavian artery thrombosis, which may be contributing to her hypotension. She also has a large mass at the right base of her lung that is invading the hemidiaphragm and causing cortical disruption of the adjacent rib and bony destruction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level, which may be indicative of underlying sepsis or cardiac dysfunction.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent brain MRI that was unremarkable, and she has a history of depression, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently receiving insulin and levothyroxine, and her medication list includes digoxin, heparin, and citalopram, which is being held while she is intubated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic PE and right subclavian artery thrombosis may be contributing to her hypotension, and she may be at risk for further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level may indicate underlying sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's atrial fibrillation and severe RV hypokinesis may be contributing to her hypotension, and she may be at risk for further cardiac decompensation.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to metabolic encephalopathy, sepsis, or leptomeningeal metastasis, and she may be at risk for further neurological decline.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent history of PVD and wound infection may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Infection: The patient's chronic PE and right subclavian artery thrombosis may increase her risk for infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess for signs of respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or neurological complications.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's mechanical ventilation settings to improve her oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen if there is evidence of infection.
4. Consider adding vasopressors to the patient's treatment regimen if there is evidence of hypotension.
5. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist or pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of her cardiac and respiratory status.
6. Consider referring the patient to a neurologist or oncologist for further evaluation and management of her neurological and oncological status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. She was intubated for airway protection and treatment of hypoxia. The patient has a chronic right pulmonary embolism (PE) and a right subclavian artery thrombosis. She also has a large mass at the right base of her lung invading the liver and bilateral pleural effusions, which is concerning for recurrence of her lung cancer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 96/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T level, indicating a possible inflammatory response. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and her platelet count is 338,000/mL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic PE and right subclavian artery thrombosis may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and elevated lactate level may indicate sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation, severe right ventricular (RV) dilation, and hypokinesis may lead to cardiac failure.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Wound infection: The patient's wound dehiscence and PVD may lead to wound infection.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and insulin therapy may lead to hyperglycemia.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require close monitoring and treatment.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's respiratory failure requires continued ventilator support and weaning trials. Her sepsis and altered mental status require empiric antibiotics and treatment of potential infections. Her cardiac failure requires continued digoxin therapy, heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation, and possible afterload reduction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her bleeding complications require close monitoring and treatment of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Her wound infection requires continued wound care and antibiotic therapy. Her hyperglycemia requires close monitoring and treatment with insulin therapy. Her hypothyroidism requires continued levothyroxine therapy.

The patient's family has been notified of her need for re-intubation, and a goal of care discussion is planned. The patient's oncologist has been contacted, and a plan for further oncologic evaluation and treatment is being developed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's recent events include:

* Failed extubation attempt with hypotension and decreased mental status, leading to reintubation
* Development of atrial fibrillation (AF) with recurrent episodes
* Presence of critical limb ischemia with PVD
* Respiratory failure with mild CO2 retention but adequate oxygenation
* Heparin and digoxin therapy for AF and anticoagulation
* Pressors required for hypotension

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.4-21.3 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 29.7-31.0%
* Plt: 338-374 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.12-0.14 ng/mL
* TCO2: 25-27 mmHg
* Glucose: 82-175 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.5/48.6/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 16/9/0.14, ALT/AST: 32/39, Alk Phos/T Bili: 510/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 86.9%, Lymph: 8.5%, Mono: 3.8%, Eos: 0.6%, Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L, LDH: 264 IU/L, Ca++: 9.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue heparin and digoxin for AF
* Empiric antibiotics pending culture data guidance
* Pressors for hypotension
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Nutrition: Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 43 mL/hour
* Glycemic control: lines and monitoring

The patient is critically ill, and the ICU care plan is ongoing.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia (PNA) due to respiratory failure and prolonged intubation
* Sepsis or septic shock due to potential bacterial infection
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to AF and underlying cardiac disease
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to hypotension and fluid imbalance
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and PVD
* Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility and compromised circulation
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to prolonged intubation and underlying lung disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS two days ago.  Left pleural
   effusion, moderate in size on admission CT likely contributing. Less
   likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also be
   component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.
   - Discontinue antibiotics as patient has been afebrile and culture
   negative, although given leukocytosis will watch fever curve and
   hemodynamics and restart if necessary.
   - Discuss with IP regarding diagnostic/therapeutic thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation until therapeutic thoracentesis.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # Systolic heart failure/atrial fibrillation:  ED bedside TTE shows
   severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF of 30%, down from 55% in
   [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).  Atrial size not commented
   on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].  Heart failure likely
   secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given severe vascular disease
   and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence of acute,
   hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation likely
   secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had trop
   leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate cards
   recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, was readmitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. She had undergone right lower extremity bypass grafting and wound dehiscence and was previously discharged to rehabilitation. The patient was reintubated due to respiratory failure and has a left pleural effusion, moderate in size, which is likely contributing to her respiratory failure. She also has hypotension, which may be due to atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload, and has been diagnosed with systolic heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient's mental status is unclear, and she has been diagnosed with altered mental status, which may be due to a combination of metabolic encephalopathy, sundowning, infections, and malignancy with possible leptomeningeal metastasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the left pleural effusion and chronic segmental pulmonary embolism. The patient may require further interventions such as diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen due to the atrial fibrillation with right ventricular overload, and the patient may require further management of her blood pressure.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen due to the underlying medical conditions, and the patient may require further evaluation and management.
4. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen due to the underlying cardiac conditions, and the patient may require further management of her heart failure.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen due to the underlying cardiac conditions, and the patient may require further management of her atrial fibrillation.
6. Lung Cancer: The patient's lung cancer may worsen due to the underlying disease process, and the patient may require further evaluation and management.
7. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may worsen due to the underlying disease process, and the patient may require further evaluation and management.
8. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 may worsen due to the underlying disease process, and the patient may require further evaluation and management.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/71 mmHg. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 374 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's antibiotic treatment and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and low tidal volume suggest a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's lung function deteriorates.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's vasopressor therapy and potential cardiac disease make it essential to monitor cardiac function closely, as cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, can arise.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and potential gastrointestinal disease make it essential to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely, as gastrointestinal bleeding can occur.
5. DVT: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and immobility make it essential to monitor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism.
6. VAP: The patient's mechanical ventilation and potential respiratory disease make it essential to monitor for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
7. Metabolic Complications: The patient's nutritional support and potential metabolic disease make it essential to monitor the patient's metabolic status closely, as metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalances, can arise.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
* She has a left pleural effusion, which is likely contributing to her restrictive physiology.
* Her blood culture and urine culture are pending, but she has been empirically treated with antibiotics due to leukocytosis.
* She has hypotension, which is likely related to her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
* Her cardiac function is impaired, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% and severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis.
* She has altered mental status, which is unclear in etiology, and is receiving sedation.
* She has left radial artery insufficiency and right subclavian artery thrombosis, which are being treated with heparin.
* She has a history of lung cancer, which is poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer, and has a large right base mass invading the liver and bilateral pleural effusions.
* She has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is being managed with insulin sliding scale.

**Potential Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and empiric antibiotic treatment suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac function is impaired, and she may require further cardiac interventions such as intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or ventricular assist device (VAD).
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of chronic segmental pulmonary embolism and her current respiratory failure suggest the possibility of pulmonary embolism, which could worsen her respiratory status.
* Wound infection: The patient's history of wound dehiscence and her current respiratory failure suggest the possibility of wound infection, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.
* Malignancy: The patient's lung cancer is advanced, and she may require further oncologic interventions such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and her current respiratory failure suggest the possibility of electrolyte imbalance, which could worsen her cardiac and respiratory status.

**Plan:**

* Continue mechanical ventilation and empiric antibiotics for respiratory failure.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further cardiac interventions such as IABP or VAD.
* Consider non-invasive ventilation or ECMO for respiratory failure.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte balance and consider further interventions such as insulin sliding scale or electrolyte replacement.
* Consider further oncologic interventions such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the patient's lung cancer.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further interventions such as weaning off sedation or treating underlying infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's current health status and potential medical complications that can arise.

The patient, a 69-year-old woman, is currently admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a history of right lower extremity (RLE) bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She was previously discharged from the vascular service to rehabilitation but was readmitted due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure, which was complicated by failed extubation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (IPM)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O. She is also receiving infusions of heparin, phenylephrine, and midazolam.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 21.3-21.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 374-387 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.13-0.14 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH: 264 IU/L

The patient's radiology results show:

* A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, which revealed a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which is likely contributing to her restrictive physiology.
* A chest CT also showed occlusive thrombosis in the right subclavian artery.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is being mechanically ventilated, and the plan is to continue empiric antibiotics given her leukocytosis. A family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care and options, including thoracentesis.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to her atrial fibrillation with RVR, and the plan is to continue antimicrobials and monitor her urine output.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's echocardiogram showed severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and hypokinesis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The plan is to continue digoxin and heparin, and to follow up with cardiology recommendations.
* Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is unclear, and the plan is to wean off sedation as appropriate.
* Left radial artery insufficiency: The patient's left radial artery insufficiency is thought to be due to a traumatic arterial thrombus from an arterial blood gas (ABG) and arterial line attempt. The plan is to continue heparin and follow up with vascular recommendations.
* Right subclavian artery thrombosis: The patient's right subclavian artery thrombosis is occlusive, and the plan is to continue heparin and follow up with vascular recommendations.
* Lung cancer: The patient's lung cancer is poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and the plan is to discuss further oncologic evaluation with her outpatient oncologist.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory acidosis.
* Hypotension: Hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, and septic shock.
* Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and pulmonary embolism.
* Altered mental status: Increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and sepsis.
* Left radial artery insufficiency: Ischemia, gangrene, and amputation.
* Right subclavian artery thrombosis: Pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology two days ago.  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also
   be component of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion
   into chest wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC
   trending up.
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate.
   - Continue empiric antibiotics given leukocytosis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care and options including
   thoracentesis.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR. Less likely to
   be SIRS physiology, although patient does have persistently elevated
   leukocytosis.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef yesterday.
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs if any.
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. She has a left pleural effusion, moderate in size, which is likely contributing to her restrictive physiology. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, but she has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 332 mmHg on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Her respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 89, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also compromised, with severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and hypokinesis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. She has a history of chronic pulmonary embolism (PE) and is at risk for further embolic events.

The patient's mental status is altered, with unclear etiology, and she is currently intubated and sedated. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 21.3 x 10^9/L, and her blood cultures are negative.

The patient's medical history includes poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer, which has recurred and invaded the liver and bilateral pleural effusions. She has a history of peripheral vascular disease and is at risk for further vascular events.

The patient's medications include digoxin, heparin, and midodrine, and she is currently receiving empiric antibiotics for possible sepsis.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is at risk for further respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiovascular status is compromised, and she is at risk for further cardiac events, including cardiac arrest, which can be life-threatening.
3. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, and her blood cultures are negative, which may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of chronic PE and is at risk for further embolic events, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
5. Vascular events: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and is at risk for further vascular events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
6. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, and her blood cultures are negative, which may indicate infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
7. Malignancy: The patient has a history of lung cancer, which has recurred and invaded the liver and bilateral pleural effusions, and she is at risk for further malignant progression, which can lead to death.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure her safety and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension of unclear
   etiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on admission
   CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Could also be component
   of splinting leading to increased WOB given tumor invasion into chest
   wall.  Culture negative since readmission, although WBC trending up.
   Family refusing thoracentesis.  Concern that patient will fail
   extubation again so will need to clarify goals of care.
   - family meeting prior to extubation
   - Check RSBI, would consider SBT if appropriate pending family meeting.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (started [**5-4**], today is day 5) given
   hypotension though low BP likely more related to atypical hemodynamics
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards reccs
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated
   - Continue to monitor urine output
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Atrial size not commented on in recent ECHO but was normal in [**Month (only) **].
   Heart failure likely secondary to (1) ischemic heart disease given
   severe vascular disease and (2) chronic PE with RV strain.  No evidence
   of acute, hemodynamically significant PE on CTA.  Atrial fibrillation
   likely secondary to structural heart disease and lung cancer.  Also had
   trop leak likely secondary to demand in the setting of RVR. Appreciate
   cards recs, restarted midodrine and florinef on [**5-7**].
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Follow-up cards recs
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine
   FEN: TF, replete electrolytes
   PPx: Heparin SQ
   Access: PIVs, femoral CVL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   SVT 150s with ABP 60s/
   [**5-6**]
   - Cards c/s: restarted midodrine/florinef
   [**5-7**]
   - Family meeting - Pt DNR. Declined thoracentesis, will try for
   extubation. Patient is still ok to intubated.
   - RSBI 60s, SBT -> minimal retention, no change in oxygenation.  Was
   going to attempt extubation but patient minimally responsive with no
   gag so deferred until AM. Stopped drip sedation, converted to bolus and
   placed on PSV.
   - Tachy to 150s, levophed requirement going up. Patient given 500, 250,
   bolus with minimal effect.  Vagal maneuvers dropped BP but not HR.
   Given additional 1000 cc IVF and neo started with goal to wean
   levophed.  Once off levophed, HR dropped to 80s with BP steady
   (90-100/50s)

Based on the progress note, the patient, Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**], is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and wound dehiscence. She was discharged from the vascular service to rehabilitation but was readmitted due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure, with a failed extubation attempt.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a left pleural effusion, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure. The family is refusing thoracentesis, and the patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and she is receiving multiple vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure. The etiology of her hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, adrenal insufficiency, or other underlying conditions.
3. Cardiac status: The patient has severe right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She also has 3+ tricuspid regurgitation and may have chronic pulmonary embolism.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is unclear due to her intubation and sedation. The etiology of her altered mental status is uncertain but may be related to metabolic encephalopathy, sundowning, infections, malignancy, or leptomeningeal metastasis.
5. Vascular complications: The patient has left radial artery insufficiency, which may be related to traumatic arterial thrombosis from arterial line attempts. She also has a right subclavian artery thrombosis, which is being treated with heparin.
6. Lung cancer: The patient has a poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer that has recurred and is invading her liver and bilateral pleural effusions.
7. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale, and her oral hypoglycemics are being held.
8. Depression: The patient's depression is being managed with citalopram, which is being held while she is intubated.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine.

The patient's current medications include:

* Midodrine and florinef for adrenal insufficiency
* Levophed and neo for vasopressor support
* Heparin for anticoagulation
* Digoxin for atrial fibrillation
* Insulin sliding scale for diabetes
* Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism
* Citalopram for depression (held while intubated)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing empiric antimicrobial therapy
* Monitoring her respiratory status and adjusting her ventilator settings as needed
* Weaning her off sedation and intubation as appropriate
* Managing her cardiac status with vasopressors and anticoagulation
* Monitoring her mental status and adjusting her medications as needed
* Managing her vascular complications with heparin and vascular recs
* Continuing her oncologic evaluation and treatment
* Managing her diabetes with insulin sliding scale and holding oral hypoglycemics
* Managing her depression with citalopram once she is extubated
* Managing her hypothyroidism with levothyroxine

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU level of care."

   Imaging: TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today, so will defer SBT.  Can
   trial T piece trial today.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-21**]) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards recs if any
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   - Continue to monitor urine output, goal UOP >30 cc/hr
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Microbiology: Sputum:
   4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today, so will defer SBT.  Can
   trial T piece trial today.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-21**]) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards recs if any
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   - Continue to monitor urine output, goal UOP >30 cc/hr
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine
   FEN: TF (held this AM), replete electrolytes
   PPx: Heparin gtt
   Access: PIVs, femoral CVL

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and recent wound dehiscence. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and febrile symptoms.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated and mechanically ventilated with a RSBI of 114, indicating a high risk of extubation failure.
* Cardiovascular status: Afib with RVR, with a recent TTE showing mild RV dilation and hypokinesis, and LVEF of 55%.
* Infectious process: Sputum culture shows 4+ GNR, with a pending speciation. The patient has been empirically treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime.
* Fever: The patient's temperature has been trending down, but she remains febrile.
* Hypotension: The patient has been requiring pressors, including neo, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is unclear due to intubation and sedation.
* Left radial artery insufficiency: Thought to represent a traumatic arterial thrombus from an ABG and arterial line attempt.
* Right subclavian artery thrombosis: Occlusive thrombosis visualized on chest CTA.
* Lung cancer: Poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer with large right base mass invading the liver and bilateral pleural effusions.
* PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's high RSBI and requirement for pressors to maintain a MAP of 65 indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's febrile symptoms and positive sputum culture suggest a high risk of sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's afib with RVR and mild RV dilation and hypokinesis on TTE indicate a high risk of cardiac complications.
* Thrombotic events: The patient's history of PVD and recent thrombosis in the right subclavian artery suggest a high risk of thrombotic events.
* Metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and recent brain MRI unremarkable suggest a high risk of metabolic encephalopathy.
* Malignancy: The patient's lung cancer and recent pleural effusions suggest a high risk of malignant complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue empiric antimicrobials for nosocomial pneumonia.
* Follow-up culture data.
* Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.
* Continue pressors as needed to maintain a MAP of 65.
* Wean off sedation as appropriate.
* Continue heparin gtt for thrombotic events.
* Follow-up vascular recs for PVD.
* Discuss goals of care with the family today.
* Consider further oncological evaluation once the patient is stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute myeloid syndrome (AMS), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing increased secretions from the endotracheal tube, which were pan-cultured and showed growth of Gram-negative rods. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorders, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, alteration in nutrition, and pain control issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the presence of pneumonia, which may require more aggressive ventilation or consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorders may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures if not properly managed.
4. Peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may lead to limb loss or amputation if not properly managed.
5. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which may worsen his overall condition.
6. Pain control issues: The patient's pain control issues may lead to increased stress, anxiety, and decreased quality of life if not properly managed.
7. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke if not properly managed.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Consider more aggressive ventilation or ECMO if the patient's respiratory failure worsens.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte and fluid disorders and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider referral to a vascular surgeon for further management of the patient's peripheral vascular disease.
6. Ensure proper nutrition and hydration to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
7. Continue to manage the patient's pain control issues with analgesics and other pain management strategies.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and consider cardioversion if necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's hypotension and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent organ dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today, so will defer SBT.  Can
   trial T piece trial today.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-21**]) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6653**] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today, so will defer SBT.  Can
   trial T piece trial today.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-21**]) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards recs if any
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65

   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD, and wound dehiscence. She was readmitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a RSBI of 114 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 383.
* Cardiovascular status: Afib with RVR, with a left atrium normal in size and mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
* Hemodynamic status: Hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 80-90 mmHg, requiring pressor support with neo.
* Infectious process: Sputum culture shows 4+ GNR, with pending speciation. The patient has a femoral central venous catheter, which may need to be pulled and re-sited.
* Fever: The patient has a temperature of 100.6°F, with a leukocytosis trending down.
* Neurological status: Altered mental status, with unclear etiology. The patient has been intubated and sedated, making it difficult to assess her current mental status.
* Other medical issues: Left radial artery insufficiency, thought to be due to a traumatic arterial thrombus from an arterial line attempt. The patient also has a right subclavian artery thrombosis, which is being followed by vascular services.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation and pressor support.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and afib with RVR may require continued pressor support and cardiology consultation.
* Infectious process: The patient's sputum culture shows GNR, and she has a femoral central venous catheter, which may need to be pulled and re-sited.
* Neurological decline: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if her underlying medical conditions are not addressed.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's left radial artery insufficiency and right subclavian artery thrombosis may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
* Wound infection: The patient's wound dehiscence and PVD may increase her risk of wound infection.

In summary, this patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious processes. She also requires ongoing cardiology and vascular consultation to address her complex medical conditions."

   Imaging: TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Microbiology: Sputum:
   4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing secondary to restrictive physiology.
   Less likely contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE
   now with improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion
   into chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB
   when not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.
   - Family meeting today to discuss critical illness and readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue sedation boluses. RSBI >100 today.   Can attempt PSV trial
   today, although unlikely to be successful.
   - Continue empiric vanc/ceftaz (day 6) for nosocomial pneumonia.
   - Follow-up culture data.
   # Fever: Concerning for infectious process, although leukocytosis
   trending down. Sputum gram stain with 4+ GNR, and patient also has
   femoral CVL.
   - Continue antimicrobials as above
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Consider pulling femoral CVL and re-siting after family meeting if
   plan to pursue further aggressive care.
   # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   - F/u culture data
   - cards recs if any
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   - Continue to monitor urine output, goal UOP >30 cc/hr
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   - Will contact outpatient oncologist today.
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine
   FEN: TF (held this AM), replete electrolytes
   PPx: Heparin gtt
   Access: PIVs, femoral CVL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 69-year-old woman, is admitted to the ICU with afib, DM2, lung cancer, and PVD, following a failed extubation and reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by a left pleural effusion, moderate in size, and chronic segmental PE. The patient has been febrile to 100.6 overnight with a sputum culture showing 4+ GNR.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a RSBI of 114.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 21.3, Hct of 31.0, and Plt of 374. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 139 mmol/L, potassium level of 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride level of 103 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF > 55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The patient's aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, and there is mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient's medical history is significant for lung cancer, PVD, DM2, and hypothyroidism. The patient is also taking medications for depression and has a history of wound dehiscence.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including the left pleural effusion, chronic segmental PE, and lung cancer invasion into the chest wall.
2. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows 4+ GNR, and the patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of factors, including afib with RVR, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and mild global free wall hypokinesis. The patient's aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but aortic stenosis is not present.
5. Wound complications: The patient has a history of wound dehiscence and is at risk for further complications.
6. Metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including metabolic encephalopathy, sun-downing, infections, and malignancy with possible leptomeningeal metastasis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation as necessary.
3. Continue sedation and analgesia as necessary.
4. Wean the patient off sedation and analgesia as appropriate.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as necessary.
7. Consider pulling the femoral CVL and re-siting after family meeting if the plan is to pursue further aggressive care.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's wound status and adjust care as necessary.
9. Consider further oncologic evaluation as an outpatient.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust care as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE now with
   improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion into
   chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB when
   not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.  In discussion with
   patient
s daughter yesterday, she is accepting of terminal nature of
   patient
s illness and is agreeable to transition to comfort care as
   patient had previously expressed desire to not be prolonged vent
   dependent.  In discussion with patient
s sister/HCP, she was not ready
   to transition patient to CMO and wanted to think about it overnight.
   She does state that she understands the critical nature of the
   patient
s illness and low likelihood of successful extubation.
   - Family meeting today with daughter and sister to readdress goals of
   care
   - Continue vent support
   - Continue vanco and ceftaz (day [**6-20**]) for empiric coverage of HAP.
   - Follow-up culture data.
    # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   - Will update outpatient oncologist today.
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated
   # Hypothyrodism:
   - Continue levothyroxine
   FEN: TF (held this AM), replete electrolytes
   PPx: Heparin gtt
   Access: PIVs, femoral CVL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE now with
   improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion into
   chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB when
   not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  Patient now
   febrile to 100.6 overnight with most recent sputum culture with 4+ GNR
   with speciation pending.  Patient continues to defer thoracentesis, and
   unclear if she would benefit given that her oxygenation has not been an
   issue.  During SBT yesterday, periods of apnea may suggest high
   pre-test probability for extubation failure.  In discussion with
   patient
s daughter yesterday, she is accepting of terminal nature of
   patient
s illness and is agreeable to transition to comfort care as
   patient had previously expressed desire to not be prolonged vent
   dependent.  In discussion with patient
s sister/HCP, she was not ready
   to transition patient to CMO and wanted to think about it overnight.
   She does state that she understands the critical nature of the
   patient
s illness and low likelihood of successful extubation.
   - Family meeting today with daughter and sister to readdress goals of
   care
   - Continue vent support
   - Continue vanco and ceftaz (day [**6-20**]) for empiric coverage of HAP.
   - Follow-up culture data.
    # Hypotension: At baseline patient has hypotension with SBP 80-90s.
   Initial hypotension likely in setting of afib with RVR.  Has
   paradoxical hemodynamics with blood pressure improving after intubation
   on [**5-5**].  Cards consulted and recommended restarting midodrine and
   florinef for adrenal insufficiency.   Switched from levophed to neo on
   [**5-7**] because of tachycardia.  Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
   function.  Patient with continued pressor requirement.
   - continue midodrine and florinef
   - wean neo as tolerated with goal MAP>65
   # CV:  ED bedside TTE shows severe RV dilation and hypokinesis and LVEF
   of 30%, down from 55% in [**2170-2-11**], and 3+ TR (stable from [**Month (only) **]).
   Repeat TTE with improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.  Afib likely
   secondary to impaired respiratory mechanics secondary to moderate
   pleural effusion and recurrent lung CA and less likely structural heart
   disease given improved surface echocardiogram.
   - Follow-up Cards recs if any
   - Continue digoxin
   - Heparin gtt
   # Altered mental status: Unclear etiology. Recent brain MRI
   unremarkable. Likely from a combination of metabolic encephalopathy,
   sun-downing, infections, malignancy with ?leptomeningeal metastasis.
   Unclear of current mental status given intubation and sedation.
   - Wean off sedation as appropriate
   # Left radial artery insufficiency:  Thought to represent traumatic
   arterial thrombus from ABG and arterial line attempt per vascular.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Follow-up vascular recs if any
   # Right subclavian artery thrombosis:  Occlusive thrombosis visualized
   on chest CTA.  Vascular following.
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Vascular reccs
   # Lung cancer: poorly differentiated squamous lung ca, s/p RLL
   resection in [**2167**], with large R base mass invading liver and bilateral
   L>R pleural effusions concerning for recurrence.   D/w outpatient
   oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1686**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6617**] - Sturdy [**Hospital **] Hospital). Assuming patient is
   stable then ok to discuss further onc eval as an oupt.
   - Family meeting today to discuss goals of care
   - Will update outpatient oncologist today.
   # PVD: s/p RLE bypass graft and wound infection.
   - Vascular reccs
   # DM2:
   - ISS, hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Depression:
   - Hold citalopram while intubated

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD, and s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea, and was reintubated after failed extubation. She has a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which is likely contributing to her restrictive physiology. She is febrile, with a recent sputum culture showing 4+ GNR. She has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of metabolic encephalopathy, sun-downing, infections, and malignancy. She has several comorbidities, including left radial artery insufficiency, right subclavian artery thrombosis, and poorly differentiated squamous lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to her pleural effusion, lung cancer invasion into the chest wall, and chronic segmental PE.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to continue due to her underlying cardiac disease, afib, and possible adrenal insufficiency.
3. Infection: The patient's febrile status and positive sputum culture suggest a high risk of infection, which could worsen her respiratory failure and other comorbidities.
4. Malignancy: The patient's lung cancer is likely to continue to progress, which could worsen her respiratory failure and other comorbidities.
5. Neurological decline: The patient's altered mental status is likely to worsen due to her underlying malignancy, metabolic encephalopathy, and possible leptomeningeal metastasis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac disease, afib, and possible adrenal insufficiency could lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's PVD and recent vascular procedures could increase her risk of venous thromboembolism, which could worsen her respiratory failure and other comorbidities.

Recommendations:

1. Continue ventilatory support to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Continue antibiotic therapy to manage the patient's infection.
3. Consider further oncological evaluation and treatment to manage the patient's lung cancer.
4. Wean the patient off sedation as appropriate to assess her mental status and neurological function.
5. Continue cardiovascular support, including pressor therapy and vasopressors, to manage the patient's hypotension.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Consider further vascular procedures, such as thrombectomy, to manage the patient's PVD and venous thromboembolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is 69-year-old woman with afib, DM2, lung cancer, PVD
   s/p RLE bypass grafting and wound dehiscence discharged on [**2170-5-3**] from
   vascular service to rehab readmitted with afib with RVR, tachypnea,
   hypotension and respiratory failure with course complicated by failed
   extubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Reintubated [**1-15**] AMS and hypotension due to
   unclear physiology on [**5-5**].  Left pleural effusion, moderate in size on
   admission CT likely contributing to restrictive physiology. Less likely
   contributing etiology is chronic segmental PE.  Repeat  TTE now with
   improved cardiac function (both LV and RV).  Lung CA invasion into
   chest wall also likely contributing to splinting and increased WOB when
   not on full assist control ventilation with sedation.  During SBT two
   days ago, periods of apnea may suggest high pre-test probability for
   extubation failure.  In discussion with patient
s daughter yesterday,
   she is accepting of terminal nature of patient
s illness and is
   agreeable to transition to comfort care as patient had previously
   expressed desire to not be prolonged vent dependent.  In discussion
   with patient
s sister/HCP, she was not ready to transition patient to
   [**Month/Year (2) 115**] and wanted to think about it overnight. This AM, patient
   sister/HCP agrees to [**Name (NI) 115**] code status and terminal extubation.
   - Morphine gtt and ativan prn
   - Plan for extubation later today
   - Per discussion with family, will continue neo for now.
   - Hold all other meds except for comfort.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and unclear physiology. She was reintubated due to failed extubation and has been on full assist control ventilation with sedation. The patient's condition is complicated by a left pleural effusion, chronic segmental pulmonary embolism, and lung cancer invasion into the chest wall, which may be contributing to restrictive physiology and increased work of breathing.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 73/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.7, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 387, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL.

The patient's medical condition is terminal, and her family is accepting of her terminal nature. The patient's sister/HCP has agreed to transition to comfort care, and the patient will be extubated later today. The plan is to continue neostigmine for now and hold all other medications except for comfort medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is complicated by chronic respiratory failure, and she may require continued ventilatory support.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she may require vasopressor support to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which may continue to contribute to restrictive physiology and respiratory failure.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a chronic segmental pulmonary embolism, which may continue to contribute to respiratory failure and hypoxemia.
5. Lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory compromise and decline in her overall condition.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and immunosuppressed state.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to contribute to cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her care accordingly to ensure her comfort and quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and prior radial artery bypass grafting, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea. She was previously discharged from the vascular service to rehab and was readmitted with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, tachypnea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by failed extubation.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, but it was stopped 24 hours ago. She is on pressors and has been extubated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 39/27 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 7.7 L/min.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 21.7, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 387, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and lactate of 0.9 mmol/L. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her condition, but she is responding to verbal commands and has a stable neurological status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require further respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, which may indicate inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
5. Wound infection: The patient has a history of wound dehiscence and may be at risk for further wound infection.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her critical illness and may require prophylactic treatment.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may require nutritional support to maintain her caloric needs and prevent deficiencies.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to her underlying medical conditions and medications.
10. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual weighing 63.3 kg, who was admitted to the ICU with unknown underlying medical conditions. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring, but these were discontinued 24 hours ago.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm (87-111 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 39/27 mmHg (30/30 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (14-32 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 85%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 21.7-17.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 387-383 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.6 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 30-29 mmHg
* Blood glucose: 119-164 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and differential neutrophil count, are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is not assessed due to the patient's condition.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a ventilator mode set to standby. The patient's SpO2 is 85%, and their ABG results are not provided.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Morphine sulfate: 2 mg/hour
* Lorazepam (Ativan): 0.5 mg/hour

The patient's medical and family history are not provided, and the patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following:

* Flowsheet data shows a 24-hour fluid balance of -1,683 mL, with a total fluid input of 572 mL and a total fluid output of 2,255 mL.
* The patient's urine output is 2,055 mL over the past 24 hours.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but their oxygen saturation is 85%, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
* Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
* Hemorrhage: The patient's platelet count is slightly decreased, which may indicate a risk of bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, which may indicate kidney dysfunction.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant amount of fluid output, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, which may indicate cardiac compromise.

Based on these findings, further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 111 bpm (87-111 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 39/27 mmHg (30-98/67 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (14-32 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 85%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 21.7
* Hematocrit: 32.9
* Platelet count: 387
* Creatinine: 0.7
* Blood glucose: 119 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results: elevated troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, and abnormal liver enzymes.

The patient's medical history includes a recent surgery for a right lower extremity bypass grafting and wound dehiscence, as well as a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's current medications include morphine sulfate and lorazepam (Ativan) for comfort.

The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula with an FiO2 of 40%, and the ventilator mode is set to standby.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,683 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's blood products show a total output of 2,255 mL, with a total input of 572 mL.

The patient's urine output is 2,055 mL, and their stool output is 200 mL.

The patient's drains show a total output of 1,683 mL, with a total input of 15 mL.

The patient's physical examination is notable for comfort appearing, with no specific abnormalities mentioned.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* The patient is being managed with comfort measures only (CMO).
* Morphine sulfate and lorazepam (Ativan) are being used for comfort.
* The patient is being monitored for respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachypnea.
* The patient is being treated for suspected stress ulcer and VAP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Tachypnea
* Infection (VAP, stress ulcer)
* Bleeding (due to platelet count being below normal)
* Liver dysfunction (due to elevated liver enzymes)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (due to atrial fibrillation)
* Wound dehiscence
* Peripheral vascular disease

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient, a 69-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, lung cancer, and peripheral vascular disease, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, tachypnea, and hypotension. She was extubated and taken off pressors, and her arterial line was stopped. The patient is receiving morphine and lorazepam for comfort and has a multi-lumen line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, with a respiratory rate of 14-32 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 85%. She may be at risk for respiratory failure or pneumonia.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypotension, which may indicate a risk for cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of lung cancer and may be at risk for developing pneumonia or other infections.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, but she has received a significant amount of fluid in the past 24 hours (572 mL). This may indicate a risk for fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition is being closely monitored, but she may be at risk for malnutrition or dehydration due to her respiratory and cardiovascular instability.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are being closely monitored, but she may be at risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to her diabetes and unstable medical status.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low (387), which may indicate a risk for bleeding or thrombosis.
8. Liver Function: The patient's liver function tests (ALT and AST) are elevated, which may indicate a risk for liver dysfunction or failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is still unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent or manage potential medical complications."
