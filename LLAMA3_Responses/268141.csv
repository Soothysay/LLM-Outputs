   CXR:
   Trach Terminating 5.8 cm above carina.  NGT terminating below diaphragm
   with tip off the film. Bibasilar atelectasis.
   CT Torso with PO contrast:
   Abd/pelvis: Complex post-surgical anatomy is difficult to delineate.
   Oral contrast is seen in the stomach and within a bowel loop descending
   anteriorly near the midline, which is presumed to represent the jejunal
   limb anastamosed to the first portion of the duodenum. Additional
   contrast is seen in the third and fourth portions of the duodenum,
   which per the surgical team are not
   contiguous with the first portion of the duodenum. this may reflect
   contrast reflux vs contrast from prior t-tube fluoro studies.
   There is no intraabdominal fluid collection, though there is extensive
   stranding in the region of the duodeunm and pancreatic head, likely
   post-surgical. the left anterior abdominal wall collections are
   essentially resolved, though there is again significant inflammatory
   change that persists. two drains are noted in this region. of note,
   more inferiorly in the abdominal wall there (2:100-104 and 300b:25)
   there is hyperdense material noted. given hx of possible feculant would
   drainage, this may represent extraluminal contrast suggesting fistula
   vs alternatively post-[**Doctor First Name 91**] material
   from component seperation/mesh repair.
   Drains/tubes: Gastrostomy in LUQ laterally. Two subQ drains, on
   entering on left and one entering on right, both coursing through the
   right subQ tissue, superficial to the abdominal wall, at the site of
   prior large fluid collection. T-tube appears to be appropriatly
   positioned, extending from the duodenum to the region of the porta,
   exiting in RUQ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He was transferred to our hospital with concerns for continued sepsis, respiratory failure, and potential endocarditis. The patient's temperature spiked to 102°F after the removal of his PICC line, and he received tylenol. He has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, micafungin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. He has also been on ventilator support with a respiratory rate of 35-40 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest ongoing sepsis, which may be related to the infected mesh and hematoma.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's history of cardiac disease and the presence of a tracheostomy tube may increase his risk of developing endocarditis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and ABG results suggest ongoing respiratory failure, which may be related to his underlying lung disease and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in several days and has been receiving laxatives, which may not be effective in this case.
5. Aortic regurgitation: The patient's history of aortic regurgitation may increase his risk of developing complications related to this condition, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizures and the presence of head bobbing may suggest ongoing seizure activity, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or the use of certain medications.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may suggest acute kidney injury, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or the use of certain medications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to receive antibiotics, including vancomycin, micafungin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, to cover possible infections. He will also receive fluid boluses as needed to manage his fluid status and prevent acute kidney injury. The patient will continue to receive respiratory support with a ventilator and will be monitored closely for signs of respiratory failure. He will also receive laxatives and stool softeners to manage his constipation. The patient's code status will be discussed with his daughter and the surgical team."

   CT Torso with PO contrast:
   Abd/pelvis: Complex post-surgical anatomy is difficult to delineate.
   Oral contrast is seen in the stomach and within a bowel loop descending
   anteriorly near the midline, which is presumed to represent the jejunal
   limb anastamosed to the first portion of the duodenum. Additional
   contrast is seen in the third and fourth portions of the duodenum,
   which per the surgical team are not
   contiguous with the first portion of the duodenum. this may reflect
   contrast reflux vs contrast from prior t-tube fluoro studies.
   There is no intraabdominal fluid collection, though there is extensive
   stranding in the region of the duodeunm and pancreatic head, likely
   post-surgical. the left anterior abdominal wall collections are
   essentially resolved, though there is again significant inflammatory
   change that persists. two drains are noted in this region. of note,
   more inferiorly in the abdominal wall there (2:100-104 and 300b:25)
   there is hyperdense material noted. given hx of possible feculant would
   drainage, this may represent extraluminal contrast suggesting fistula
   vs alternatively post-[**Doctor First Name 91**] material
   from component seperation/mesh repair.
   Drains/tubes: Gastrostomy in LUQ laterally. Two subQ drains, on
   entering on left and one entering on right, both coursing through the
   right subQ tissue, superficial to the abdominal wall, at the site of
   prior large fluid collection. T-tube appears to be appropriatly
   positioned, extending from the duodenum to the region of the porta,
   exiting in RUQ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to a new hospital with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. 

The patient has a fever of 102°F, which is likely related to an abdominal source given the presence of Klebsiella and Enterococcus in a hematoma at his surgical wound site. The patient is receiving antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and Zosyn, and micafungin has been added for yeast coverage. 

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Infected mesh and/or hematoma: The patient's fever and laboratory results suggest the possibility of infected mesh and/or hematoma, which requires prompt surgical evaluation and management.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute. He has a primary respiratory alkalosis on his arterial blood gas (ABG) results, which suggests that he may have a respiratory acidosis.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.9, which is likely prerenal in origin given his elevated sodium level.

4. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in several days, and his CT scan did not show evidence of obstruction.

5. Head bobbing: The patient's daughter has reported that he has been head bobbing, which may be related to seizure activity.

6. Elevated liver enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.

7. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including aortic regurgitation, and is not receiving cardiac medications at the present time.

8. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a fluid balance deficit and is at risk for electrolyte imbalances.

9. Infection: The patient has a PICC line that was recently removed, and his blood cultures are pending.

10. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory rate is 35 breaths per minute.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to trend the patient's temperature and white blood cell count.

2. Send blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture to identify the source of the patient's infection.

3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and consider the possibility of hepatitis C infection.

4. Consult with the surgery team to evaluate the patient's infected mesh and/or hematoma.

5. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to optimize the patient's antibiotic coverage.

6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider the possibility of endocarditis.

7. Continue to provide respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation.

8. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance and provide IV fluids as needed.

9. Consider the possibility of a bowel obstruction and consult with a gastroenterologist if necessary.

10. Continue to monitor the patient's head bobbing and consider the possibility of seizure activity.

11. Consult with a neurologist to evaluate the patient's head bobbing and consider the possibility of seizure activity.

12. Continue to provide pain management with fentanyl and consider the possibility of a pain pump.

13. Consult with a palliative care specialist to evaluate the patient's symptoms and provide comfort care.

14. Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is now being transferred to a new hospital with concerns about infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including cirrhosis, and has undergone several surgeries, including Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy. He has also been experiencing respiratory failure and is currently on a ventilator.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Infected mesh and/or hematoma: The patient has a high risk of developing an infected mesh or hematoma, which could lead to serious complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and has a high risk of developing further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management.
4. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, which could be due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
5. ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF), which is likely prerenal in origin.
6. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which could lead to further complications, including bowel obstruction.
7. Head bobbing: The patient has been experiencing head bobbing, which could be due to seizure activity or other neurological causes.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continue IV antibiotics to cover gram-negative rods and yeast.
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ failure.
3. Continue to trend the patient's sodium levels and adjust IV fluids as needed.
4. Consider placing a G-J tube or line through the duodenal drain for enteral feeding.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
6. Consider ordering an EEG and head CT to evaluate the patient's head bobbing.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider ordering further tests to evaluate the cause of elevated LFTs.
8. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider ordering further tests to evaluate the cause of ARF.
9. Consider ordering further tests to evaluate the patient's constipation, including a colonoscopy.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust the medical plan as needed.

In summary, the patient is a complex case that requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical issues. The patient's condition is unstable and requires immediate attention to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is currently being treated in the ICU for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of seizures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient has a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F) and is likely to have an abdominal source given the presence of Klebsiella and Enterococcus from a hematoma at his surgical wound site.
* Infected mesh and/or hematoma: The patient has a concern for infected mesh and/or hematoma, which is being treated with antibiotics and surgical consultation.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator and has a respiratory alkalosis, which is being treated with volume assist control.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
* ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury, which is being treated with fluid boluses and continued IVF boluses as needed.
* Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in several days and is being treated with repeat erythromycin, protonix, and reglan.
* Head bobbing: The patient is experiencing head bobbing, which may be due to seizure activity.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's infected mesh and/or hematoma may lead to sepsis, which could worsen his condition.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his ventilator settings are not adjusted properly.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if he is not receiving adequate fluid resuscitation.
* Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if his bowel regimen is not adjusted properly.
* Seizure activity: The patient's head bobbing may be due to seizure activity, which could worsen his condition if not treated promptly.

To address these potential complications, the patient's medical team should:

* Continue to monitor the patient's temperature, blood cultures, and other laboratory results to assess the severity of his infection.
* Adjust his antibiotic regimen as necessary to ensure adequate coverage.
* Monitor his ventilator settings to ensure proper oxygenation and ventilation.
* Continue to provide fluid resuscitation and IVF boluses as needed to manage his acute kidney injury.
* Adjust his bowel regimen as necessary to manage his constipation.
* Consider treating the patient's head bobbing with anticonvulsant medication if it persists.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill male with a complex medical history, currently in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia, and has developed melena, which has been evaluated by GI consult. He has also had episodes of resp alkalosis, and has been treated with Fentanyl. His ID consult has recommended repeat abdominal CT and MRI/duplex of PV, but these have not been ordered due to concerns about stability for MRI. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and blood thinners.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/84 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination is notable for his altered mental status, with eyes open and head bobbing, as well as his wound infection with multiple drains in place. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.8 K/uL, a hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 317 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and wound infection increase his risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and may worsen if his ventilation settings are not optimized.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena may worsen if his coagulopathy is not addressed.
4. Wound infection: The patient's wound infection may spread and become more severe if not properly managed.
5. Renal failure: The patient's high creatinine and low albumin levels suggest that he may be at risk for developing renal failure.
6. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which could worsen if not addressed.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and medications may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias."

   Total time spent:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with polymicrobial sepsis, presumed to be secondary to intraabdominal pathology. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 100.9°F (38.3°C)
* Heart rate: 83-103 bpm
* Blood pressure: 148/80-168/94 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13-37 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* WBC: 12.8-11.8 K/uL
* Hct: 27.6-28.8%
* Plt: 17-125,000/mm3
* Cr: 1.4-2.0 mg/dL
* TCO2: 20-24 mmHg
* Glucose: 95-125 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.2/27.8/1.4, ALT/AST: 585/416, Alk Phos/T Bili: 232/12.1, Amylase/Lipase: 21/0, Differential-Neuts: 85.2%, Lymph: 11.4%, Mono: 2.6%, Eos: 0.3%, Lactic Acid: 1.5 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.2 g/dL, LDH: 399 IU/L, Ca++: 7.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL, PO4: 5.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, overweight/obese
* Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, endotracheal tube
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral Vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right DP pulse not assessed, left DP pulse not assessed
* Respiratory/Chest: Clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema 2+, left lower extremity edema 2+
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to noxious stimuli, no spontaneous movement, tone not assessed

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 13-37 inspirations per minute, and the ABG results indicate a respiratory alkalosis.
* Altered mental status: The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale is not provided, but the note mentions altered mental status without a clear etiology.
* Wound infection: The patient has a wound infection, and the plan is to perform surgery.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated.
* Nutrition: The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and the plan is to elucidate the tube/drain location to establish an optimal route for feeding via the gut.
* LFTs obstructive picture: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) indicate an obstructive picture.

Based on the provided information, the patient requires continued ICU care, including respiratory support, cardiovascular monitoring, and management of their polymicrobial sepsis. The patient's wound infection and altered mental status require further evaluation and treatment. The patient's hypernatremia and LFTs obstructive picture require close monitoring and potential interventions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status:
   Patient is critically ill.  Time spent on care
 50 minutes
   Disposition : ICU
   Total time spent:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with polymicrobial sepsis presumed to be secondary to an intra-abdominal source. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 100.9°F (38.3°C)
* Heart rate: 83-103 bpm
* Blood pressure: 148/80 mmHg (97-108/71-94 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13-37 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory alkalosis and a need for ventilatory support. The patient is receiving oxygen delivery via a tracheostomy tube and is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500-976 mL, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's abdominal examination is notable for soft, bowel sounds present, and right and left lower extremity edema, 2+.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with:

* White blood cell count: 12.8-11.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 317 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7-1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 115-119 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium 153-153 mEq/L, potassium 3.5-3.5 mEq/L, magnesium 2.5-2.5 mg/dL, and phosphate 5.1-5.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 399 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.3-7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5-2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 5.1-5.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Polymicrobial sepsis with a presumed abdominal source
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Wound infection
* Hypernatremia
* Nutrition: The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will require further optimization of tube/drain location to establish an optimal route for feeding via the gut.
* LFTs: The patient has an obstructive picture, and further evaluation is needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction syndrome
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated complications
* Neurological sequelae due to altered mental status
* Wound infection and sepsis
* Hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalances
* LFT abnormalities and potential liver damage
* Kidney injury and acute kidney injury
* Cardiovascular complications due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalances
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction
* Infection and sepsis due to central lines and other invasive devices."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever: Likely abdominal source given Klebsiella, Enterococcus from a
   hematoma at his surgical wound site.  Concern for infected mesh +/-
   hematoma.
   - Trend temp curve, WBC
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary cx, 3 JPs
   cx
   - f/u culture data from all drain sites
   - Continue GNB coverage with IV Abx, Vanc and meropenem
   - Micafungin for yeast
   - Surgery team consult (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; f/u any recommendations (will
   discuss cholangigram, feeding)
   - f/u ID consult recs
   - Resite lines (obtain peripherals, pulled PICC)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 IR may be able to place distal
   feeding tube, likely beyond possible enterocutaneous fistula.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever: Likely abdominal source given Klebsiella, Enterococcus from a
   hematoma at his surgical wound site.  Concern for infected mesh +/-
   hematoma.
   - Trend temp curve, WBC
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary cx, 3 JPs
   cx
   - f/u culture data from all drain sites
   - Continue GNB coverage with IV Abx, Vanc and meropenem
   - Micafungin for yeast
   - Surgery team consult (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; f/u any recommendations (will
   discuss cholangigram, feeding)
   - f/u ID consult recs
   - Resite lines (obtain peripherals, pulled PICC)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 IR may be able to place distal
   feeding tube, likely beyond possible enterocutaneous fistula.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [**Hospital1**] due to concerns about infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He has a history of cardiac arrest 13 years ago following IV contrast administration for a CT scan. The patient is currently in the ICU with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infected Mesh and Hematoma: The patient's surgical wound site is likely infected, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for further respiratory deterioration, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory acidosis.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could lead to further complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, and cardiovascular instability.
4. Constipation and Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent melena and stool seen on CT scan suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and sepsis.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability.
6. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and current cardiovascular instability suggest that he is at risk for further cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
7. Seizure Activity: The patient's recent head bobbing and history of seizures suggest that he may be at risk for further seizure activity, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and brain injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
3. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's sodium levels closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
5. Consider performing a gastrointestinal evaluation to determine the cause of the patient's constipation and gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
7. Consider performing a cardiovascular evaluation to determine the cause of the patient's cardiovascular instability.
8. Monitor the patient's seizure activity closely and adjust anticonvulsant therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever: Likely abdominal source given Klebsiella, Enterococcus from a
   hematoma at his surgical wound site.  Concern for infected mesh +/-
   hematoma.
   - Trend temp curve, WBC
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary cx, 3 JPs
   cx
   - f/u culture data from all drain sites
   - Continue GNB coverage with IV Abx, Vanc and meropenem
   - Micafungin for yeast
   - Surgery team consult (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; f/u any recommendations (will
   discuss cholangigram, feeding)
   - f/u ID consult recs
   - Resite lines (obtain peripherals, pulled PICC)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 IR may be able to place distal
   feeding tube, likely beyond possible enterocutaneous fistula.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever: Likely abdominal source given Klebsiella, Enterococcus from a
   hematoma at his surgical wound site.  Concern for infected mesh +/-
   hematoma.
   - Trend temp curve, WBC
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, biliary cx, 3 JPs
   cx
   - f/u culture data from all drain sites
   - Continue GNB coverage with IV Abx, Vanc and meropenem
   - Micafungin for yeast
   - Surgery team consult (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; f/u any recommendations (will
   discuss cholangigram, feeding)
   - f/u ID consult recs
   - Resite lines (obtain peripherals, pulled PICC)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 IR may be able to place distal
   feeding tube, likely beyond possible enterocutaneous fistula.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history, including polymicrobial sepsis, respiratory failure, acute liver failure, and altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition is unstable, and there are several potential medical complications that may arise. These include:

1. Wound infection: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest following IV contrast administration for a CT scan, and there is concern about infected mesh and hematoma.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Liver failure: The patient has acute liver failure, which may lead to further complications, such as bleeding, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
4. Sepsis: The patient has polymicrobial sepsis, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
5. Neurological compromise: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to sepsis, liver failure, or other underlying conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding or perforation.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease and may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

The patient's laboratory results are abnormal, with elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and hypernatremia. The patient's imaging studies, including a CT scan and US, show evidence of liver disease and a possible liver mass.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover polymicrobial sepsis.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function.
3. Fluid management: The patient is receiving fluid boluses to support blood pressure and cardiac output.
4. Nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to gastrointestinal compromise.
5. Liver support: The patient is receiving liver support therapy, including lactulose and rifampin.
6. Blood product transfusions: The patient is receiving blood product transfusions to support coagulopathy.
7. Surgical intervention: The patient is scheduled for surgical intervention to address wound infection and liver disease.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction and requires aggressive management to address these complications. Further imaging studies and laboratory tests are needed to better understand the patient's underlying condition and guide treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - plan for line holiday, blood cultures negative to date
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 100 cc/hr; corrected rapidly to 143 and then discontinued
   D5W.  Repeat 148.  Will restart D5W and monitor closely.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melana:  Patient with 2 episodes of melana overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - check AFP
   - consider further imaging to further characterize
   # Nutrition: KUB today showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient tachypneic overnight
   with RR 30s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started yesterday per daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
   history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic activity
   over night.
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with concerns about infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to our hospital.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: He is intubated and on a ventilator with a respiratory rate of 30s and primary respiratory alkalosis.
* Cardiovascular status: He has a regular heart rate and rhythm, with a blood pressure of 150/77 mmHg.
* Neurological status: He is unresponsive with eyes open and head bobbing, which may indicate seizure activity.
* Gastrointestinal status: He has had two episodes of melena overnight and is at risk for constipation and gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal status: He has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a peak creatinine level of 1.9 and is receiving IV fluids and monitoring his urine output and renal function.
* Hepatic status: He has elevated liver enzymes (LFTs) and is at risk for liver failure.
* Infection status: He has a peritoneal fluid culture growing E. coli resistant to zosyn, and his blood cultures are pending.

The patient's medical history is significant for cardiac arrest 13 years ago after receiving IV contrast for a CT scan, and he has a history of testicular cancer.

The patient's current medications include:

* Meropenem for suspected intra-abdominal infection
* Vancomycin for suspected surgical site infection
* Micafungin for suspected fungal infection
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis
* Insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia management

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis from the intra-abdominal infection
* Respiratory failure from the ventilator and underlying lung disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias from the patient's cardiac history and potential electrolyte imbalances
* Liver failure from the elevated LFTs
* Kidney failure from the AKI
* Gastrointestinal bleeding from the melena and constipation
* Infection from the central lines and other invasive devices

The patient's care plan includes:

* Trending fever curve and blood cultures
* Continuing meropenem and vancomycin
* Monitoring electrolyte levels and adjusting IV fluids as needed
* Monitoring renal function and urine output
* Trending LFTs and considering further imaging to further characterize the liver mass
* Considering enteral feeding and coordinating with GI or IR to place a distal feeding tube
* Monitoring the patient's neurological status and considering further EEG and imaging studies
* Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjusting medications as needed

The patient's code status is full, and he is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure following multiple surgical interventions. He has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, and has had a PICC line placed. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis and has been prescribed antihistamines and corticosteroids.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 37.1°C, HR = 87 bpm, BP = 151/75 mmHg, RR = 24 insp/min, SpO2 = 100%
* Respiratory support: Tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode, PS = 15 cmH2O, PEEP = 5 cmH2O, FiO2 = 40%
* Laboratory results: WBC = 11.8, Hct = 28.8, Plt = 125,000, Cr = 1.6, TCO2 = 20, Glucose = 115
* Medical conditions: Fever, hypernatremia, melena, liver mass, respiratory failure, ARF, CAD, aortic regurgitation, hyperglycemia
* Medications: Vancomycin, meropenem, micafungin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium

Potential medical complications:

* Infection: The patient's fever and laboratory results suggest that he may have an infection. The patient's history of anaphylaxis and his current treatment with antibiotics increase the risk of an adverse reaction to antibiotics.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is in the 20s, and his ABG results show primary respiratory alkalosis. He is on volume assist control and may require further respiratory support.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.9 from a baseline of 1.0. He may require further treatment for ARF, including IVF boluses and monitoring of UOP and renal function.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia. He may require insulin sliding scale therapy.
* Liver mass: The patient's liver mass may be causing his elevated LFTs. Further imaging and evaluation are needed to characterize the mass and determine the best course of treatment.
* Aortic regurgitation: The patient's aortic regurgitation may be causing his hypotension and decreased cardiac output. He may require further monitoring and treatment to manage his cardiovascular status.

Recommendations:

* Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
* Continue respiratory support and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
* Continue IVF boluses and monitor UOP and renal function for ARF.
* Monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor liver function and consider further imaging and evaluation of the liver mass.
* Monitor cardiovascular status and consider further treatment for aortic regurgitation.
* Coordinate with GI or IR to place a distal feeding tube beyond the EC fistula for optimal nutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   for > 24 hours.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT; patient will need
   to be pre-medicated with solumedrol/Benadryl d/t previous anaphylactic
   reaction (reportedly VF arrest 13 years ago)
   - Contact OSH in [**State 503**] for speciation of their yeast cx
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient with respiratory rate
   20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control; tolerating trach collar
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 250 cc/hr; corrected to 145.  Will continue D5W for a
   liter.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   # Nutrition: KUB yesterday showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Nutrition consult for TPN recommendations pending enteral feeding
   tube placement.
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) for an infected mesh and hematoma. He was transferred to the current hospital with concerns for infected mesh, hematoma, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing fever, which has been trending downward, and is now afebrile for over 24 hours. He has a positive C. difficile test and is being treated with metronidazole. He also has a positive blood culture, and his ID team is monitoring his condition.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is being managed with D5W, and his sodium levels are being closely monitored. He has also had two episodes of melena overnight, but his hemodynamic status remains stable.

The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may be due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection. He is undergoing further imaging to further characterize the liver mass.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), which is being managed with IVF boluses and close monitoring of his urine output and renal function.

The patient has a history of seizures, and his daughter has reported head bobbing, which may be related to seizure activity. He is undergoing further evaluation with an EEG.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including ARF, CAD, aortic regurgitation, and hyperglycemia, which are being managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's C. difficile infection is being managed, but he is at risk for developing further infections due to his compromised immune system and presence of invasive lines.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration if his mechanical ventilation is not properly managed.
3. AKI: The patient's AKI is being managed, but he is at risk for further kidney damage if his blood pressure and volume status are not properly managed.
4. Liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver failure, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
5. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizures and recent head bobbing episode suggest that he may be at risk for further seizure activity, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing further medical complications due to his complex medical condition and presence of invasive lines. Close monitoring and management of his condition are essential to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a complex medical history, including a history of seizures, hepatitis C infection, and aortic regurgitation. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, and is receiving IV fluids and nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient's fever curve is trending downward, but he is still at risk for developing a serious infection, particularly in the presence of a c. difficile infection.
2. Surgical site infection: The patient's surgical site may be infected, which could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator and has a primary respiratory alkalosis, which may indicate a worsening respiratory status.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may indicate a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
5. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass that may be causing elevated liver enzymes and potentially leading to liver failure.
6. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate a risk of acute kidney injury.
7. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizures and has been experiencing head bobbing, which may indicate a risk of seizure activity.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which may indicate a risk of hypoglycemia.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may indicate a risk of electrolyte imbalance.
10. Infection: The patient's multiple lines and drains may be at risk for infection, particularly in the presence of a c. difficile infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely to identify any changes in his condition.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infections and manage his respiratory status.
3. Consider further imaging to evaluate the liver mass and potential for liver failure.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
5. Consider the use of anticonvulsants to manage the patient's seizure activity.
6. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin sliding scale accordingly.
7. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to manage the patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's IV lines and drains for signs of infection and remove any unnecessary lines or drains.
9. Consider the use of antivirals to manage the patient's hepatitis C infection.
10. Monitor the patient's aortic regurgitation and adjust his fluid and medication management accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   for > 24 hours.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u stool studies
   - check CMV VL per ID rec given multiple blood transfusions
   - plan for T tube cholangiogram given elevated LFT; patient will need
   to be pre-medicated with solumedrol/Benadryl d/t previous anaphylactic
   reaction (reportedly VF arrest 13 years ago)
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - On D5W at 250 cc/hr; corrected to 145.  Will continue D5W for a
   liter.
   - continue Q6H Na levels
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   # Nutrition: KUB yesterday showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, on vent; patient with respiratory rate
   20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis.
   - continue on volume assist control.
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection
   - continue to trend
   - T tube cholangiogram to further evaluate
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - patient received fluid bolus with 1L NS and had creatinine drop to
   1.4 and sodium to 145.  Now stable at 1.6.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # Constipation/GIB: stool seen on OSH CT scan, now having melena
   - GI and surgery both aware of new melena.
   - likely no intervention at this time, trend HCT q 8 for now and then
   space to [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - continue to hold pending acute infection
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN when has access
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: PIV x 2
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   # Nutrition: KUB yesterday showing minimal gas throughout the small and
   large bowel.
   - Ordered for TPN but not currently receiving as no dedicated line
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He has a history of multiple surgical interventions and is currently on ventilator support. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including:

* Fever, which has been trending downward, but the patient remains at risk for surgical site infection and infected mesh or hematoma.
* Hypernatremia, which has been managed with D5W and will continue to be monitored.
* Melena, which has occurred twice overnight, but the patient's hemodynamic status remains stable.
* Liver mass, which is being further evaluated, but the patient is unable to undergo MRI due to a incompatible LTHR.
* Respiratory failure, which is being managed with volume assist control and the patient's ABG results show primary respiratory alkalosis.
* Head bobbing, which was initially thought to be seizure activity, but has decreased in frequency and may be related to hyperventilation.
* Elevated LFTs, which may be due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
* ARF, which has been managed with fluid boluses and is currently stable.
* Constipation/GIB, which is being monitored and may require further intervention.
* CAD, which is being held pending acute infection.
* Aortic regurgitation, which is being monitored for volume status and hemodynamics.
* Hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications:

* Surgical site infection or infected mesh or hematoma, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Respiratory failure, which could worsen and require more aggressive management.
* ARF, which could worsen and require more aggressive management.
* Constipation/GIB, which could lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
* Hyperglycemia, which could worsen and require more aggressive management.
* Aortic regurgitation, which could worsen and require more aggressive management.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Continue to manage the patient's fever with antipyretics and antibiotics as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hypernatremia and adjust D5W as necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with volume assist control and adjust as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine and adjust fluid management as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Consider further imaging to further evaluate the patient's liver mass.
* Consider further evaluation of the patient's constipation/GIB.
* Consider further evaluation of the patient's aortic regurgitation.
* Consider further management of the patient's hyperglycemia.
* Consider further management of the patient's CAD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man who had ERCP in [**State 503**] and suffered a laceration of the gastric artery. He had complicated surgery and has been experiencing recurrent bowel infections, including enterococcal, staphylococcal, and yeast infections. The patient has a tracheostomy and has been receiving treatment for various conditions, including E. coli and yeast infections from his JP drains.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/81 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient has been experiencing maroon stools for three days, which is concerning for bleeding. His hemoglobin levels have been stable, but he has not received any interventions for this issue.

The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an elevated ALT and AST, indicating possible liver damage. His AFP levels are normal, but there is a liver mass suspected.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and anticoagulants. He has also been receiving IV fluids and nutrition, but his nutrition plan needs to be reassessed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent bowel infections and presence of yeast in his JP drains increase his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's maroon stools and stable hemoglobin levels suggest bleeding, which may worsen and lead to anemia or even death.
3. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and suspected liver mass increase his risk of developing liver failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and his oxygen saturation is dependent on the tracheostomy mask. He may develop respiratory failure if his respiratory status worsens.
5. Infection: The patient's presence of yeast and E. coli in his JP drains increases his risk of developing infections, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure.

To address these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Aggressive management of his bowel infections with antibiotics and antifungals.
2. Further evaluation and management of his liver mass.
3. Monitoring of his bleeding and hemoglobin levels.
4. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and adjustment of his oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Prevention of infections with proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and administration of antibiotics only when necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is currently being treated for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.

The patient has developed several potential medical complications:

1. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient has a history of gram-negative rods growing in his peritoneal fluid, which may indicate an intra-abdominal infection.
2. Surgical site infection: The patient has a surgical site infection, which may be related to the infected mesh or hematoma.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or the surgical interventions he has undergone.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may be related to dehydration or other underlying medical conditions.
5. Melena: The patient has experienced two episodes of melena overnight, which may be related to bleeding or other gastrointestinal issues.
6. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass, which may be benign or malignant.
7. CMV positivity: The patient is positive for CMV, which may indicate that he has been infected with the virus.
8. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may indicate liver damage or disease.
9. ARF: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may be related to dehydration or other underlying medical conditions.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or the medications he is taking.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics to treat his intra-abdominal infection and surgical site infection.
2. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving respiratory support, including a tracheostomy and volume assist control.
3. Nutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to provide him with essential nutrients.
4. Hyperglycemia management: The patient is receiving insulin sliding scale to manage his blood sugar levels.
5. Liver function monitoring: The patient's liver function will be monitored regularly to assess any potential liver damage or disease.
6. Renal function monitoring: The patient's renal function will be monitored regularly to assess any potential kidney damage or disease.
7. Infectious disease monitoring: The patient's infectious disease status will be monitored regularly to assess any potential infections or sepsis.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing further medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to a new hospital (Hospital1) due to concerns about infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.
* The patient has a tracheostomy and is mechanically ventilated.
* He has a history of seizures and is currently being monitored for potential seizure activity.
* The patient has a central line (PICC line) in place and is receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) without lipids.
* He has a history of liver disease and is currently being monitored for liver function.
* The patient has a history of hyperglycemia and is being managed with insulin sliding scale.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Surgical Site Infection (SSI):** The patient has a high risk of developing SSI due to the multiple surgical interventions and the presence of infected mesh and hematoma.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a history of respiratory failure. He is at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. **Seizure Activity:** The patient has a history of seizures and is currently being monitored for potential seizure activity. He is at risk of developing further seizures or status epilepticus.
4. **Liver Failure:** The patient has a history of liver disease and is currently being monitored for liver function. He is at risk of developing further liver failure or liver-related complications.
5. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient has a history of hyperglycemia and is being managed with insulin sliding scale. He is at risk of developing further hyperglycemic episodes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. **Infection:** The patient has a central line (PICC line) in place and is at risk of developing central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
7. **Renal Failure:** The patient has a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) and is at risk of developing further renal failure or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
8. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient has a history of aortic regurgitation and is at risk of developing further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
9. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (melena) and is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing various medical complications, including surgical site infections, respiratory failure, seizure activity, liver failure, hyperglycemia, infections, renal failure, cardiovascular complications, and gastrointestinal complications. Close monitoring and management are essential to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2123-5-17**]
   - OSH culture data showing yeast in abdominal fluid from [**5-6**] and [**5-7**]:
   cultures growing C. albicans (no sensitivities)
   - Nutrition recs: check chem 10 qd, check TG (513), Goal TPN provide
   Trig and BS WNL will be 1.8L(320g dextrose/95g protein/45g fat) to
   provide 1918kcal; tube feed once small bowel feeding tube if placed,
   start with Vivonex TEN at 10ml/hr, monitor tolerance; continue SSI
   - ID recs: continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]; continue IV flagyl for C. Diff; continue
   micafungin pending final yeast cultures; follow-up CMV VL; repeat Bl cx
   if spikes
   - Surgery recs: plan for G-tube duodenostomy with small bowel
   follow-through study today to confirm position of T-tube and rule out
   leaks/obstruction
   - GI recs: may need scope for GIB but will hold off for now
   - Went for G-tube/duodenal tube barium study as above showing leak in
   duodenal tube, no barium processing through stomach. Then vomited up
   barium, had blood in JP drain, and melena at 9pm. F/u KUB ordered (no
   read yet but looks like majority of barium in stomach with little
   progression after ~4 hours). Surgery was consulted over these findings
   but nothing to do at this time. Hct stable at 28.
   - Hypernatremia: improved to 142 by PM labs.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. The patient has been diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction and has undergone multiple surgical procedures, including a gastrostomy tube placement.

The patient's current condition is complicated by the presence of yeast in their abdominal fluid, which has grown C. albicans. They are receiving treatment with vancomycin, micafungin, and metronidazole to manage this infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 147/75 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes. Their coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 28.3 seconds. Their renal function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and they are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids. Their glycemic control is being monitored, and they are receiving insulin therapy as needed.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. They are receiving mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's surgical plan includes a gastrostomy tube duodenostomy with a small bowel follow-through study to confirm the position of the T-tube and rule out leaks or obstruction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's yeast infection and elevated white blood cell count increase their risk of developing sepsis.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's compromised renal function and abnormal coagulation profile increase their risk of developing organ dysfunction.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's compromised nutritional status increases their risk of developing malnutrition and related complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised respiratory status increases their risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's presence of yeast in their abdominal fluid increases their risk of developing further infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of a gastrostomy tube increase their risk of developing further gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction increases their risk of developing further complications, such as perforation or necrosis.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels increase their risk of developing pancreatitis.
9. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes increase their risk of developing liver dysfunction.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and abdominal infection following a gastric artery laceration during ERCP. The patient has a prolonged course with multiple OR trips, and a duodenostomy tube with a leak.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/68 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheal mask and has an SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, indicating ongoing inflammation and organ dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's fluid status is complex, with a fluid balance of -704 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has received a total of 3,336 mL of fluids, including 1,103 mL of crystalloid and 2,865 mL of blood products.

The patient's abdominal examination is significant for soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities show 1+ edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask, and the patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.17.

The patient's neurologic examination is significant for attentive behavior, ability to follow simple commands, and normal tone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's abdominal sepsis and ongoing inflammation increase the risk of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated lung injury.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's duodenostomy tube with a leak increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly the elevated potassium level, increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other electrolyte-related complications.
5. Infection: The patient's ongoing inflammation and organ dysfunction increase the risk of secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
6. Seizures: The patient's abnormal EEG results and history of seizures increase the risk of seizure recurrence.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing inflammation and organ dysfunction increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery: Plan to start tube feeds through the duodenostomy tube
   tomorrow. Follow output on drains to see where leakage.
   - ID: continue current ABX regimen, + CMV VL likely due to multiple
   transfusions. Recommend that if scoped by GI then can biopsy
   - GI: no plan to scope, signed off
   - Neurology: EEG did have one peroid of suspicious focal left temporal
   activity without clinical correlate, no alteration in consciousness.
   Caveat that this was poor quality given that recorded at end of 48 hour
   period.
   - Duodenostomy study:
   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y.o. male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely.
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium slowly increasing to 146 this morning.
   - restart D5W @ 100cc/hr x 1 liter
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - started on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Surgery recommending tube feeds via duodenostomy tube; will clarify
   with surgery as contrast has not progressed.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   - restart aspirin/beta blocker.
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery: Plan to start tube feeds through the duodenostomy tube
   tomorrow. Follow output on drains to see where leakage.
   - ID: continue current ABX regimen, + CMV VL likely due to multiple
   transfusions. Recommend that if scoped by GI then can biopsy
   - GI: no plan to scope, signed off
   - Neurology: EEG did have one peroid of suspicious focal left temporal
   activity without clinical correlate, no alteration in consciousness.
   Caveat that this was poor quality given that recorded at end of 48 hour
   period.
   - Duodenostomy study:
   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is currently being treated in the ICU for respiratory failure, infected mesh, infected hematoma, and hypernatremia. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a history of respiratory failure and primary respiratory alkalosis. He is currently on a trach collar and is being closely monitored for any changes in his respiratory status.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a trend towards improvement. The patient's bilirubin levels are also elevated, which may be related to the infected hematoma or other underlying liver disease.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 146 mmol/L and a potassium level of 4.0 mmol/L. The patient's hypernatremia is being managed with IV fluids and a sodium-restricted diet.

The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, with a value of 124 mg/dL. The patient is being treated with insulin and a sliding scale regimen to manage his hyperglycemia.

The patient's platelet count is low, with a value of 288,000/μL. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with a prolonged PT and PTT.

The patient's infectious disease profile is complex, with a history of C. difficile infection and a current infection with gram-negative rods. The patient is being treated with antibiotics and is at risk for further complications.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also a concern, with a history of aortic regurgitation and CAD. The patient is being monitored closely for any changes in his cardiovascular status.

The patient's neurologic status is also a concern, with a history of head bobbing and seizure-like activity. The patient's EEG is pending, and further evaluation and management are needed to address these concerns.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management. The patient's respiratory, liver, electrolyte, and cardiovascular status are all critical and require close attention. The patient's infectious disease profile is also complex, and further evaluation and management are needed to address these concerns."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery: Plan to start tube feeds through the duodenostomy tube
   tomorrow. Follow output on drains to see where leakage.
   - ID: continue current ABX regimen, + CMV VL likely due to multiple
   transfusions. Recommend that if scoped by GI then can biopsy
   - GI: no plan to scope, signed off
   - Neurology: EEG did have one peroid of suspicious focal left temporal
   activity without clinical correlate, no alteration in consciousness.
   Caveat that this was poor quality given that recorded at end of 48 hour
   period.
   - Duodenostomy study:
   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium slowly increasing to 146 this morning.
   - restart D5W @ 100cc/hr x 1 liter
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with stable HCT.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Surgery recommending tube feeds via duodenostomy tube; will clarify
   with surgery as contrast has not progressed
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is being transferred to a new hospital with concerns about infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including c. difficile positive, CMV positive, and a history of seizures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Trached and on trach collar, with a respiratory rate of 20s and primary respiratory alkalosis. The patient is being closely monitored for respiratory status.
* Fever: The patient had a fever, but it has been trending down since May 15th. The patient is being treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is slowly increasing to 146. The patient is being treated with D5W at 100cc/hr x 1 liter to correct the hypernatremia.
* Melena: The patient had two episodes of melena overnight, but remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT. The patient is being monitored for further episodes.
* Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass, but further imaging is needed to characterize it. The patient cannot have an MRI due to a left hip replacement that is not compatible with MRI.
* Nutrition: The patient is currently on TPN, but optimal would be enteral feeding. The patient will need to be coordinated with GI or IR to place a distal feeding tube beyond the EC fistula.
* CMV+: The patient is CMV positive, and the ID team is recommending suppressive therapy.
* Head bobbing: The patient had head bobbing, which may be related to seizure activity. The patient's daughter reported that the patient had a history of seizures in the past.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated, possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection. The LFTs are trending down.
* ARF: The patient reached peak creatinine of 1.9, but it has improved to 1.1 after NS fluid bolus and D5W for hypernatremia.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, but it is not being actively managed at this time.
* Aortic regurgitation: The patient has aortic regurgitation, and the patient's volume status and hemodynamics are being closely monitored.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is being managed with an insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, but further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated LFTs suggest that the patient may be at risk for sepsis.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver mass and elevated LFTs suggest that the patient may be at risk for liver failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF and hypernatremia suggest that the patient may be at risk for further renal deterioration.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and aortic regurgitation suggest that the patient may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena and elevated LFTs suggest that the patient may be at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Central nervous system complications: The patient's history of seizures and head bobbing suggest that the patient may be at risk for further central nervous system complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery: Plan to start tube feeds through the duodenostomy tube
   tomorrow. Follow output on drains to see where leakage.
   - ID: continue current ABX regimen, + CMV VL likely due to multiple
   transfusions. Recommend that if scoped by GI then can biopsy
   - GI: no plan to scope, signed off
   - Neurology: EEG did have one peroid of suspicious focal left temporal
   activity without clinical correlate, no alteration in consciousness.
   Caveat that this was poor quality given that recorded at end of 48 hour
   period.
   - Duodenostomy study:
   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   1. Percutaneous duodenostomy tube with small leakage seen around the
   catheter entrance into the duodenum, with tracking along the catheter
   and liver. No definite biliary leak of contrast that refluxed into the
   biliary system, though a small contained leak at the T tube entrance
   site to the CBD can not be excluded.
   2. Gastrojejunostomy was filled retrograde but unable to distend
   completely, a followup radiograph in 45- 60 minutes is recommended.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU and identify potential medical complications that can arise.

**Summary:**

The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [**Hospital1**] with concerns about infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of multiple surgical interventions, including a tracheostomy, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors, including:

* Intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods (E. coli, Klebsiella)
* Surgical site infection
* Infected mesh
* Hematoma
* Respiratory failure
* Hypernatremia
* Melena
* Liver mass
* CMV positivity
* Head bobbing (possible seizure activity)
* Elevated liver function tests (LFTs)
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Cardiovascular disease (CAD)
* Aortic regurgitation
* Hyperglycemia
* FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional imbalance)

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's intra-abdominal infection and surgical site infection increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. **Respiratory failure:** The patient's respiratory rate is in the 20s, and he has primary respiratory alkalosis. This may indicate a need for closer monitoring and potential adjustments to his ventilator settings.
3. **Hypernatremia:** The patient's sodium levels are increasing, which may indicate a need for further fluid management and electrolyte correction.
4. **Melena:** The patient's melena may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
5. **Liver mass:** The patient's liver mass may be a sign of liver disease or cancer, which could lead to liver failure and other complications.
6. **CMV positivity:** The patient's CMV positivity may increase the risk of complications, such as CMV retinitis, which could lead to vision loss and other systemic complications.
7. **Head bobbing:** The patient's head bobbing may indicate seizure activity, which could lead to further complications, such as brain injury or death.
8. **Elevated LFTs:** The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate liver damage or disease, which could lead to liver failure and other complications.
9. **ARF:** The patient's ARF may indicate kidney damage or disease, which could lead to chronic kidney disease and other complications.
10. **Cardiovascular disease:** The patient's CAD and aortic regurgitation may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with intraabdominal sepsis following gastric artery laceration and multiple bowel surgeries. The patient has a history of anemia, and his current lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.9, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 288. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a central line and PICC line in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 147/75 mmHg. He is receiving TPN without lipids and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's intraabdominal sepsis may progress, leading to septic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Infection: The patient's wound infection may spread, causing further complications and increasing the risk of sepsis.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly sodium, potassium, and calcium, are abnormal, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to muscle wasting, weakness, and impaired immune function.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue, leading to anemia, bleeding complications, and increased risk of sepsis.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypoxia, and death.
8. Hyperthermia: The patient's fever may worsen, leading to hyperthermia, heat stroke, and death.
9. Wound Complications: The patient's wound may develop complications, such as dehiscence, fistula, or abscess, which may lead to further infection and sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the patient's intraabdominal sepsis and wound infection.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely, and adjust his fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.
3. Consider placing a post-duodenal tube or feeding through the current tube to improve the patient's nutrition.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's temperature and consider antipyretics or cooling measures if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's wound closely for signs of infection or complications, and consider debridement or other interventions as necessary.
7. Consider consultation with a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium stable at 145
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with downtrending HCT this morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to coordinate today with IR for possible placement.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) for concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.
* He is currently being treated at [**Hospital1**] with a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation.
* He has developed a bilious/purulent drainage from the proximal incision site, which is being cultured and awaiting results.
* He has a history of c. difficile positivity and is being treated with flagyl.
* His laboratory results show hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and acute kidney injury (AKI).
* He has a history of seizures and is being monitored for seizure activity.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's bilious/purulent drainage from the incision site is a potential source of infection, and the cultures are pending. If the cultures are positive, it may indicate a surgical site infection, infected mesh, or infected hematoma.
2. **Sepsis:** Given the patient's clinical condition and laboratory results, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration if his oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase.
4. **Kidney Injury:** The patient's AKI is a concern, and there is a risk of further kidney damage if not managed appropriately.
5. **Seizure Activity:** The patient's history of seizures and current head bobbing activity may indicate ongoing seizure activity, which could lead to further complications.
6. **Hepatic Dysfunction:** The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate ongoing liver damage or dysfunction, which could lead to further complications.
7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** The patient's inability to receive enteral feeding due to the EC fistula may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could exacerbate his underlying condition.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely.
2. Manage the patient's infection and sepsis aggressively with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his oxygenation and ventilation requirements as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's kidney injury with IV fluids and electrolyte repletion.
5. Monitor the patient's seizure activity closely and consider further imaging or electroencephalogram (EEG) to rule out ongoing seizure activity.
6. Consider further imaging or liver function tests to evaluate the patient's liver function and potential liver damage.
7. Coordinate with the patient's primary care physician and other healthcare providers to develop a comprehensive plan for his ongoing care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -After discussion with surgery, patient will go to fluoroscopy for
   [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal tube placement and will start tube feeds after
   placement.
   -Fluoroscopy does not think they will be able to insert feeding tube
   due to marked angle of duodenum; need to speak to IR as their attending
   thought they could place tube.
   - Patient began to leak bilious/purulent material from proximal
   incision that is beginning to open.  Surgery evaluated and sent
   cultures.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions for an infected mesh and hematoma. He is currently in the ICU with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, and his current laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is in the 20s, and his ABG shows primary respiratory alkalosis, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient's surgical site is draining bilious and purulent material, which suggests the possibility of an infected mesh and hematoma.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient's C. difficile infection may lead to further complications, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening colitis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, which may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and even death if not treated promptly.
6. ARF: The patient's creatinine level has increased, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as coagulopathy, jaundice, and potentially life-threatening liver failure.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is currently receiving TPN, but his bowel function is impaired, which may lead to malnutrition and further complications.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor his condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   -After discussion with surgery, patient will go to fluoroscopy for
   [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal tube placement and will start tube feeds after
   placement.
   -Fluoroscopy does not think they will be able to insert feeding tube
   due to marked angle of duodenum; need to speak to IR as their attending
   thought they could place tube.
   - Patient began to leak bilious/purulent material from proximal
   incision that is beginning to open.  Surgery evaluated and sent
   cultures.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium stable at 145
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with 2 episodes of melena overnight, remained
   hemodynamically stable with downtrending HCT this morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to coordinate today with IR for possible placement.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient, a 74-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) for concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy. He has a history of c. difficile positivity and is being treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Bilious/purulent drainage from the abdominal incision site, which is concerning for a surgical site infection.
2. Fever, which has resolved since May 15th, but cultures are pending.
3. Respiratory failure, with an ABG showing primary respiratory alkalosis.
4. Hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 145.
5. Melena, with two episodes overnight, but the patient remains hemodynamically stable.
6. Liver mass, with an AFP level that is normal, but further imaging is needed to characterize the lesion.
7. CMV positivity, with plans for suppressive therapy and an ophthalmology consult.
8. Head bobbing, which was initially concerning for seizure activity, but has resolved.
9. Elevated LFTs, which are trending down, but the cause is unclear.
10. ARF, with a peak creatinine level of 1.9, but the patient has improved with IVF boluses and D5W for hypernatremia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's underlying infections and fever.
2. Respiratory failure or worsening respiratory status due to the patient's underlying respiratory disease.
3. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to the patient's diabetes and insulin sliding scale.
4. Renal failure or worsening ARF due to the patient's underlying kidney disease.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's underlying liver disease and melena.
6. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) due to the patient's PICC line.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's mechanical ventilation.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with abdominal sepsis, multiple surgeries, and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 145/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 99%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -601 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with soft and non-tender abdomen, bowel sounds present, and an open wound at the top of the incision. He has right and left lower extremity edema, but is unable to stand due to muscle weakness.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 14.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 90 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 19 mmHg
* Glucose: 95 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin, and is also receiving antifungal medication for C. diff. He is being fed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's abdominal sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, or renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring more aggressive respiratory support or even mechanical ventilation.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may continue to worsen, potentially leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. C. diff infection: The patient's C. diff infection may not respond to treatment, leading to recurrent diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's open wound at the top of the incision may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
6. Wound infection: The patient's open wound may become infected, leading to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and receive adequate nutrition may lead to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased immune function.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - Speech/swallow to visit today for valve placement to enable pt to
   speak
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 141 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to go to IR for procedure -  this intervention will require
   contrast dye; patient currently being loaded with solumedrol,
   famotidine, and Benadryl.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - Speech/swallow to visit today for valve placement to enable pt to
   speak
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 141 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to go to IR for procedure -  this intervention will require
   contrast dye; patient currently being loaded with solumedrol,
   famotidine, and Benadryl.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient's fever has subsided, but there is a concern for infected mesh and hematoma, which could lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are being closely monitored, and there is a risk of hypernatremia leading to further complications if not managed promptly.
4. Melena: The patient has had episodes of melena, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, and further monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
5. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass, and further imaging is needed to characterize it. This could lead to complications if not managed promptly.
6. CMV positivity: The patient is CMV positive, and suppressive therapy is recommended. This could lead to complications if not managed properly.
7. Head bobbing: The patient has had episodes of head bobbing, which could indicate seizure activity. Further monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
8. Elevated LFTs: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which could indicate hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection. Further monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
9. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, which could lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which could lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
11. FEN: The patient has a history of FEN, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor his condition closely and address any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.

   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to go to IR for procedure -  this intervention will require
   contrast dye; patient currently being loaded with solumedrol,
   famotidine, and Benadryl.

   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone multiple surgical interventions and has a history of c. difficile positive infection.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is trached and has been transitioned to a trach collar, with an episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s. The patient's ABG shows primary respiratory alkalosis.
* Neuro: The patient is alert and responsive, following commands.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate is regular, and blood pressure is stable.
* Abdomen: The patient has an open area in the midline incision with visible fascia underneath, and there is bilious/purulent drainage from the proximal incision site.
* Nutrition: The patient is currently receiving TPN and has minimal gas throughout the small and large bowel.
* Liver function: The patient has elevated LFTs, which are trending down.
* Renal function: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) and is receiving IVF boluses as needed.
* Blood chemistry: The patient has hypernatremia, which has been managed with D5W, and hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin sliding scale.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods
* Surgical site infection
* Infected mesh
* Infected hematoma
* Respiratory failure
* Hypernatremia
* Hyperglycemia
* Acute kidney injury
* Elevated liver function tests
* c. difficile infection
* Possible seizure activity (head bobbing)
* Possible CMV infection

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Trending fever curve
* Following up on blood culture
* Continuing meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin
* Redosing antibiotics for trough <15
* Continuing flagyl for C. diff
* F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
* Monitoring respiratory status closely
* Speech/swallow evaluation for valve placement
* F/U Cx for incision drainage
* Monitoring HCT and transfusing for HCT <25 or active bleeding
* F/U GI recs
* Considering further imaging to characterize liver mass
* Coordinating with GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
* F/U ID recs regarding suppressive therapy for CMV
* Considering ophthalmology consult for CMV

The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement, with plans to discuss discharge to [**Hospital1**] with CM."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u blood culture
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities)
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 141 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; will
   need to go to IR for procedure -  this intervention will require
   contrast dye; patient currently being loaded with solumedrol,
   famotidine, and Benadryl.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   - f/u T tube cholangiogram final read
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with concerns of infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He has undergone multiple surgical interventions and has been diagnosed with c. difficile positivity. The patient is currently being treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and micafungin. He has also been started on flagyl for c. difficile.

The patient has been experiencing hypernatremia, which has been managed with D5W. He has also been experiencing tachypnea, which has been treated with IV morphine. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is currently on a trach collar.

The patient has been experiencing melena, but his HCT is stable. He has also been experiencing a liver mass, which is being monitored with AFP levels. The patient is currently on TPN and is being considered for enteral feeding.

The patient has been diagnosed with CMV positivity and is being considered for suppressive therapy. He has also been experiencing head bobbing, which may be related to seizure activity.

The patient's LFTs are elevated, but are trending down. He has also been experiencing ARF, which is being managed with IVF boluses and close monitoring of UOP and renal function.

The patient has a history of seizures and has been experiencing elevated LFTs, which may be related to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's infected mesh and hematoma are at risk of becoming infected, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a concern, and his tachypnea may be a sign of underlying lung disease.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is a concern, and he may be at risk of developing cerebral edema or seizures.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver mass is a concern, and he may be at risk of developing liver failure.
5. ARF: The patient's ARF is a concern, and he may be at risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
6. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and head bobbing are a concern, and he may be at risk of developing further seizures.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's melena is a concern, and he may be at risk of developing further gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Sepsis: The patient's infected mesh and hematoma are at risk of becoming infected, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia with D5W and monitor his sodium levels closely.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider further imaging to further characterize the liver mass.
4. Continue to manage the patient's ARF with IVF boluses and close monitoring of UOP and renal function.
5. Consider further testing to rule out underlying causes of the patient's seizures and head bobbing.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further treatment if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and consider further antibiotics if necessary.
8. Consider further testing to rule out underlying causes of the patient's liver failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with abdominal sepsis, multiple surgeries, and a tracheostomy. He has been receiving various antibiotics and medications in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/85 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute and is receiving oxygen therapy. His physical examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present and a wound with slight yellowish drainage. He has peripheral edema in both lower extremities and is unable to stand.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hypernatremia. His blood cultures are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's abdominal sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Wound infection: The patient's wound with slight yellowish drainage may be infected, which can lead to further complications, such as sepsis, abscess formation, or wound dehiscence.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to electrolyte imbalance, which can cause muscle weakness, cramps, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is receiving oxygen therapy. Prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or lung injury.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate oral nutrition and his reliance on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's peripheral edema may be a sign of cardiac dysfunction, and his history of multiple surgeries may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
8. Infection-related complications: The patient's abdominal sepsis and wound infection may lead to infection-related complications, such as sepsis, shock, or organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities). If LFTs
   normalize may transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 142 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; then
   changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have required
   contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and Benadryl.
   - feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities). If LFTs
   normalize may transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 142 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; then
   changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have required
   contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and Benadryl.
   - feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Did not get G to J tube given concern of passage through duodenum.
   Plan is now to start tube feeds through duodenostomy tube.
   - Goals are enteral nutrition, promote wound healing so that that some
   time in the future general surgery may repair
   - Speech and swallow placed passy muir valve, having trouble using
   - Nutrition has recs in chart for TF (vivonex 10ml/hr x24 hr then
   advance as tolerated to goal 80cc/hr) through duodenostomy tube (NOT
   G-tube). Ordered and will start in AM. Not clear that this formulation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Did not get G to J tube given concern of passage through duodenum.
   Plan is now to start tube feeds through duodenostomy tube.
   - Goals are enteral nutrition, promote wound healing so that that some
   time in the future general surgery may repair
   - Speech and swallow placed passy muir valve, having trouble using
   - Nutrition has recs in chart for TF (vivonex 10ml/hr x24 hr then
   advance as tolerated to goal 80cc/hr) through duodenostomy tube (NOT
   G-tube). Ordered and will start in AM. Not clear that this formulation
   at LTCF so may need to address

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection with gram negative rods
   (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid.  Concern for
   surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.  Patient now afebrile
   since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c. difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem, vancomycin; redose for trough <15
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities). If LFTs
   normalize may transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: Patient continued with hypernatremia last night and
   received 1 liter of D5W.  Subsequently, sodium stable at 142 this
   morning
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum.  Drains in place still draining white contrast.
   - currently on TPN
   - Optimal would be enteral feeding
 will need to coordinate with
   either GI or IR to place distal feeding tube beyond EC fistula
   - Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding tube; then
   changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have required
   contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and Benadryl.
   - feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) for an infected mesh and hematoma. He was transferred to the current hospital with concerns for respiratory failure, infected mesh, and hematoma. The patient is currently receiving IV antibiotics and has been transitioned to a tracheostomy collar. He has a duodenostomy tube in place and is being fed through this tube.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/82 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 34 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. His white blood cell count is 12.3 K/uL, and his platelet count is 45 K/uL.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient's fever and positive C. difficile test suggest an intra-abdominal infection, which may require further treatment.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest respiratory failure, which may require further treatment.
3. Infected mesh and hematoma: The patient's surgical site infection and infected mesh and hematoma may require further treatment.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 142 mmol/L, which is above the normal range.
5. Melena: The patient has had episodes of melena, which may be related to his gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass, which may require further imaging or biopsy.
7. CMV+: The patient has tested positive for CMV, which may require further treatment.
8. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may be related to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
9. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which may be related to prerenal azotemia.
10. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 201 mg/dL, which may be related to his hypernatremia.

Plan:

1. Continue IV antibiotics for intra-abdominal infection.
2. Monitor respiratory status closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia with IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation.
4. Monitor the patient's melena and consider further treatment if necessary.
5. Consider further imaging or biopsy of the liver mass.
6. Continue to manage the patient's CMV+ with suppressive therapy.
7. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to manage the patient's ARF with IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation.
9. Monitor the patient's blood glucose level and adjust treatment as necessary.
10. Discuss the patient's disposition with the healthcare team and consider discharge to a lower level of care if clinically stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure and post-surgical abdominal infection. The patient has undergone multiple surgeries following a gastric artery laceration during ERCP. The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Somnolent but denies pain
* Tachypnea and trach collar in place
* Foley catheter present
* WBC count up to 17 today
* Fever absent
* Respiratory support with O2 delivery device and ABG readings
* Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance tracking
* Abdominal wound with mild purulent drainage
* Edema absent in both lower extremities
* Neurologic examination shows somnolent patient who follows simple commands

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and there is a history of abdominal infection, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and trach collar in place indicate respiratory distress, which may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may lead to hypernatremia and other electrolyte imbalances.
4. Wound infection: The patient's abdominal wound is infected, which may spread to other areas of the body if not treated promptly.
5. Nutritional compromise: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure may lead to malnutrition if not properly managed.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are elevated, which may indicate hemodynamic instability.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal wound and edema absent in both lower extremities may increase the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
8. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium if not properly managed.
9. Kidney injury: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and fluid imbalance may increase the risk of kidney injury.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure and post-surgical abdominal infection. He has undergone multiple surgeries following a gastric artery laceration during ERCP. The patient has a polymicrobial infection, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and is being treated with a combination of antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Micafungin, Meropenem, and Metronidazole. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being managed with a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.7°F (37.1°C), heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/85 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. He is somnolent but denies pain.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his abdominal wound is draining purulent material. He has a Foley catheter in place, and his urine output is adequate.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, indicating an active infection. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypocalcemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial infection and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if his oxygenation and ventilation requirements are not adequately managed.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing abdominal infection increase the risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock.
4. Wound infection: The patient's abdominal wound infection may spread to other areas of the body, leading to further complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia and hypocalcemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not managed promptly.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered mental status and inability to take food orally may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen his overall condition.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobility and risk factors for deep vein thrombosis increase the risk of developing a DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   # Fever/Abdominal Pathology:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection
   with gram negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal
   fluid.  Concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.
   Patient now afebrile since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c.
   difficile positive.
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem; vancomycin discontinued on [**2123-5-22**]
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities). If LFTs
   normalize may transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum. Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding
   tube; then changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have
   required contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and
   Benadryl.
   Feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs.
   - currently on TPN
   - Continue current tube feeds at 10ml/hour for a total of 24 hours.
   Then, increase tube feeds as tolerated for goal of 80 ml/hr.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: No further hypernatremia
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions and is currently being treated for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has a complex medical history, including a history of seizures, hepatitis C, and aortic regurgitation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is trached and has been transitioned to a trach collar. He has a respiratory rate of 29 inspirations per minute, and his ABG shows primary respiratory alkalosis.
* Abdominal status: The patient has a bilious and purulent drainage from the proximal incision site, and his abdominal examination is unchanged from admission.
* Nutritional status: The patient is currently receiving TPN and is being fed through a duodenostomy tube. His nutrition plan includes a goal of 80 mL/hr of tube feeds.
* Renal status: The patient has reached peak creatinine of 1.9 from a baseline of 1.0, likely due to prerenal azotemia. His creatinine has improved to 1.1 after IVF boluses and D5W.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are being managed with insulin sliding scale.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are being monitored, and he is receiving IVF boluses as needed.
* Melena: The patient has had episodes of melena, but his HCT is stable, and he is not actively bleeding.
* Liver mass: The patient's AFP levels are normal, and further imaging is being considered to characterize the liver mass.
* CMV+: The patient is positive for CMV, and further ID recs regarding suppressive therapy are being considered.
* Head bobbing: The patient has a history of seizures, and his head bobbing has decreased since the start of his admission.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are trending down, and further evaluation is being considered to determine the cause of his elevated LFTs.
* Cracked molar: The patient has a cracked molar, which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further respiratory support.
* Abdominal infection: The patient's abdominal examination is unchanged from admission, and he may require further surgical intervention to manage his abdominal infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he may require further IVF boluses and D5W to manage his renal function.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are being managed with insulin sliding scale, but he may require further adjustments to his insulin regimen.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are being monitored, and he may require further IVF boluses as needed.
* Melena: The patient has had episodes of melena, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause of his bleeding.
* Liver mass: The patient's liver mass is being evaluated further to determine its significance and potential impact on his overall health.
* CMV+: The patient is positive for CMV, and further ID recs regarding suppressive therapy are being considered.
* Head bobbing: The patient has a history of seizures, and his head bobbing has decreased since the start of his admission.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are trending down, and further evaluation is being considered to determine the cause of his elevated LFTs.
* Cracked molar: The patient has a cracked molar, which is being monitored.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide further respiratory support as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's abdominal infection with antibiotics and further surgical intervention as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide further IVF boluses and D5W as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin sliding scale and further adjustments as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's sodium levels and provide further IVF boluses as needed.
* Continue to evaluate the patient's liver mass and consider further imaging to determine its significance and potential impact on his overall health.
* Consider further ID recs regarding suppressive therapy for the patient's CMV+ status.
* Continue to monitor the patient's head bobbing and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of his seizures.
* Continue to evaluate the patient's elevated LFTs and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of his elevated LFTs.
* Continue to monitor the patient's cracked molar and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of his cracked molar.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and further discussion with the CM is needed to determine the best course of action for his discharge."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with abdominal sepsis, multiple surgeries post gastric artery laceration during ERCP, and a polymicrobial infection. The patient is currently receiving antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, micafungin, and metronidazole for 6 weeks.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/73 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheal mask, with a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and infection. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypocalcemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal cardiovascular and respiratory examinations. The patient's abdominal examination shows non-tender and less drainage from the superior aspect of the midline incision.

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, electrolyte and fluid disorder, gastrointestinal bleed, altered nutrition, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support with total parenteral nutrition and tube feeds, as well as prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's polymicrobial infection and abdominal sepsis may lead to sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Wound infection: The patient's wound infection may worsen, leading to further complications such as cellulitis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock, coagulopathy, and further complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, and cardiovascular instability.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to further complications such as delirium, coma, and increased risk of falls and injuries.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. The patient's condition has remained stable over the past 24 hours, with a slight increase in temperature and heart rate. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.9°C, Tcurrent of 36.4°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 71/22 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -200 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids and Vivonex (Full) for nutrition, and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's TF fluid leakage is concerning, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the leakage and potential infection.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, but the patient's fluid status is still a concern, particularly with the ongoing fluid drainage from the TF and JP drains.
3. Sepsis: The patient's temperature and heart rate are slightly elevated, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is 99%, which may indicate the presence of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's INR is elevated, which may indicate the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction.
8. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurological examination is incomplete, and further evaluation is needed to determine the patient's neurological status.

Recommendations:

1. Further evaluation of the TF fluid leakage to determine the cause and potential infection.
2. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status and balance.
3. Consideration of antibiotics and/or antifungals based on the patient's fluid culture results.
4. Continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
5. Further evaluation of the patient's respiratory status, including a thorough pulmonary examination and consideration of mechanical ventilation if necessary.
6. Consideration of gastrointestinal bleeding and potential interventions, such as vasopressin and/or octreotide.
7. Close monitoring of the patient's renal function and potential interventions, such as dialysis.
8. Further evaluation of the patient's neurological status, including a comprehensive neurological examination and potential imaging studies."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 71/22 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and potential sepsis. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 21 mg/dL.

The patient's abdominal incision is open, and there is evidence of fluid leakage from the thoracic drain. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids and Vivonex (full) nutrition. The patient's blood glucose levels are within the normal range, and they are receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, there is a high risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal failure.
4. Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal incision is open, and there is evidence of fluid leakage from the thoracic drain, which may lead to abdominal complications such as abscesses or fistulas.
5. Bloodstream infections: The patient's central venous catheter (PICC line) increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to their immobility and medical condition.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be effective in preventing stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk ICU admission with multiple potential medical complications. Close monitoring and prompt management of these complications are essential to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fever/Abdominal Pathology:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection
   with gram negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal
   fluid.  Concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.
   Patient now afebrile since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c.
   difficile positive.  Vancomycin discontinued on [**2123-5-22**]
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities).
   - f/u LFTs normalize consider transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum. Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding
   tube; then changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have
   required contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and
   Benadryl.
   Feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs. Tolerating tube feeds at 10cc for
   24 hours so advancing slowly towards goal of 80cc/hr.
   - currently on TPN
   - Continue tube feeds and advance slowly towards 80cc/hr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   .
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: No further hypernatremia
   - check sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].
   # Code:  Full per HCP daughter

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who has undergone multiple surgical interventions at an outside hospital (OSH) and is now being transferred to [**Hospital1**] with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on a tracheostomy collar, with a respiratory rate of 20s and primary respiratory alkalosis. He has been transitioned from a ventilator to a tracheostomy collar and is doing well for several days, except for one episode of tachypnea last night.
* Abdomen: The patient has a midline incision with open areas and visible fascia underneath, with bilious and purulent drainage from the proximal incision site.
* Nutrition: The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is tolerating tube feeds at 10cc for 24 hours, with plans to advance slowly towards a goal of 80cc/hr.
* Infection: The patient has a concern for intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods (E. coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal fluid, and is receiving antibiotics for C. difficile and yeast.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have trended down, but will continue to be monitored.
* Melena: The patient has had episodes of melena early during his hospitalization, but has remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit (HCT).
* Liver mass: The patient has a liver mass, with normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and may require further imaging to further characterize the mass.
* CMV+: The patient is positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and may require suppressive therapy.
* Head bobbing: The patient has had episodes of head bobbing, which may be related to seizure activity.
* Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, possibly due to hypoperfusion or hepatitis C infection.
* Cracked molar: The patient has a cracked molar that will be monitored for now, but may require extraction if it becomes loose and causes concern for aspiration.
* ARF: The patient has reached peak levels of acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 1.9, which is likely prerenal given the elevated sodium levels.
* CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is on medications for it.
* Aortic regurgitation: The patient has aortic regurgitation and will be monitored for volume status and hemodynamics.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but may deteriorate if he develops respiratory failure.
* Intra-abdominal infection: The patient's intra-abdominal infection may worsen if not properly managed with antibiotics and surgical intervention.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver mass and elevated LFTs may indicate liver failure, which could have serious consequences if not addressed.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen if not properly managed with IV fluids and medication.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and aortic regurgitation may increase his risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
* Seizure activity: The patient's head bobbing may indicate seizure activity, which could have serious consequences if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum. Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding
   tube; then changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have
   required contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and
   Benadryl.
   Feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs. Tolerating tube feeds at 10cc for
   24 hours so advancing slowly towards goal of 80cc/hr.
   - currently on TPN
   - Continue tube feeds and advance slowly towards 80cc/hr

   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with concerns for infected mesh, infected hematoma, and respiratory failure. He has undergone multiple surgical interventions and has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, coccidioidomycosis, and possible intra-abdominal infection with gram-negative rods.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, and blood pressure of 71/22 mmHg. He is intubated and on a tracheostomy collar, with a respiratory rate of 29 inspirations per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on aerosol-cool, trach mask.

The patient has a bilateral pleural effusion, with a total output of 2,992 mL and an input of 2,300 mL. He has a central line in place, and his blood products have been transfused as needed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, with a total bilirubin of 46 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin of 27.5%. His albumin is 2.4 g/dL, and his lactate dehydrogenase is 246. His white blood cell count is 14.2 K/uL, and his platelet count is 390.

The patient has a history of seizures and is being monitored for seizure activity. He has also been diagnosed with hypernatremia, which has been treated with IV fluids.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, meropenem, and micafungin, which have been discontinued or continued as needed. He is also receiving IV fluids, oxygen, and nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and he is on a tracheostomy collar. He may require further respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient has a bilateral pleural effusion and is at risk for further infection or sepsis.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which may require further treatment or monitoring.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction or damage.
5. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizures and is being monitored for seizure activity. He may require further evaluation or treatment for seizure control.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has been treated for hypernatremia, but he may require further monitoring or treatment to prevent recurrence.
7. Aortic regurgitation: The patient has a history of aortic regurgitation, which may require further evaluation or treatment.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment will be necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p multiple surgical interventions at an OSH now being
   transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] with concern for infected mesh, infected hematoma,
   and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Fever/Abdominal Pathology:  Most likely intra-abdominal infection
   with gram negative rods (E. Coli, Klebsiella) growing in peritoneal
   fluid.  Concern for surgical site infection, infected mesh, hematoma.
   Patient now afebrile since [**2123-5-15**] at noon.  Also found to be c.
   difficile positive.  Vancomycin discontinued on [**2123-5-22**].
   - trend fever curve
   - f/u microdata here
   - continue meropenem (6 week course)
   - continue flagyl IV for C. diff (day 1 = [**5-16**])
   - continue micafungin for yeast ; f/u on sensitivies here (at OSH,
   yeast was C. [**Hospital 12620**] hospital does not do sensitivities).
   - f/u LFTs normalize consider transition to fluconazole
    - pt underwent line holiday, now with PICC line in place
   - f/u ID recs
   - F/U surgery recs re: abdominal incision openings
   - plan to transfer pt to surgery team today
   .
   # Nutrition: KUB showing minimal gas throughout the small and large
   bowel, duodenostomy study with contrast that did not progress beyond
   the duodenum. Plan initially for fluoro guided [**Last Name (un) 1446**]-intestinal feeding
   tube; then changed to IR for procedure -  this intervention would have
   required contrast dye; patient loaded with solumedrol, famotidine, and
   Benadryl.
   Feeding tube not placed due to concern about passing through the
   duodenum.  Will attempt tube feeds via existing duodenostomy tube with
   tube feeds based on nutrition recs. Tolerating tube feeds at 10cc for
   24 hours so advancing slowly towards goal of 80cc/hr.
   - currently on TPN
   - Continue tube feeds and advance slowly towards 80cc/hr
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Trached, was on vent; patient with respiratory
   rate 20s.  ABG with primary respiratory alkalosis. Has been
   transitioned to trach collar and doing well for several days. One
   episode of tachypnea last night into the 30s.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status closely
   - now has PMV in place though not yet able to speak.
   .
   # Incision Drainage
 surgical incision now with bilious/purulent
   drainage from proximal incision site s/p staple removal.
   - F/u Cx
   - f/u surgery recommendations
   # Hypernatremia: No further hypernatremia
   - check sodium qd
   .
   #Melena:  Patient with episodes of melena early during this
   hospitalization, remained hemodynamically stable with stable HCT this
   morning.
   - monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - transfuse for HCT <25 or active bleeding
   - f/u GI recs
 no plan to scope at this time
   .
   #Liver mass:
   - AFP normal
   - consider further imaging to further characterize, though patient
   cannot have MRI due to L THR that is not compatible with MRI.
   .
   # CMV +:
   - f/u ID recs regarding suppressive therapy
   - consider ophthalmology consult
   .
   # Head Bobbing: ? seizure activity.  Started on day of admission per
   daughter. [**Name (NI) **] history of seizures in the past, though decreased rhythmic
   activity overnight on HD 1.  No further head bobbing or seizure like
   activity.
   - f/u EEG read (note: machine accidentally kicked by a family member
   near end of recording strip; this could possibly account for
   abnormality around that time)
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: possibly due to hypoperfusion vs. hepatitis C
   infection. LFTs trending down.
   - continue to trend daily
   .
   # ? Cracked molar
 Will monitor for now as not loose; if becomes loose
   and concern for aspiration, will contact dental for extraction.
   .
   # ARF: Reached peak of 1.9 from baseline of 1.0. Likely prerenal given
   elevated sodium.  After NS fluid bolus and 2 liters of D5W for
   hypernatremia, creatinine improved to 1.1.
   - continue IVF boluses as needed and continue to monitor UOP and renal
   function.
   .
   # CAD: on b-blocker, statin, aspirin at home, not continued at OSH
   .
   # Aortic regurgitation:
   - Monitor volume status and hemodynamics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  likely due to D5W for management of hypernatremia
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, picc line,  TPN, TF
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots for now
   # Access: PICC
   # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 532**] [**Known lastname 12477**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12482**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with abdominal sepsis, polymicrobial infection, and multiple surgeries post gastric artery laceration during ERCP. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure, altered mental status, and wound infection. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, and blood pressure of 136/83 mmHg. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has had recent surgeries. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing infection and inflammation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's polymicrobial infection and sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Wound infection: The patient's wound infection may worsen, leading to further sepsis, abscess formation, or organ failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypernatremia, may worsen, leading to neurological complications, such as seizures or coma.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and altered mental status may lead to poor wound healing, increased risk of infection, and decreased ability to respond to treatment.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate hemodynamic instability, which may worsen if left untreated.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, coma, or even death if not addressed promptly.
8. Infection control: The patient's polymicrobial infection may lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making treatment more challenging.
9. Organ failure: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction may lead to organ failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, or liver failure.
10. Mortality: The patient's critical illness and multiple organ dysfunction may increase his risk of mortality if not managed promptly and effectively."
