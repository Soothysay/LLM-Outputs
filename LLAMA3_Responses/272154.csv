   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), decreased venous return in
   setting of malignancy/venous obstruction, sepsis, decompensated CHF,
   GIB in setting of guaiac positive stool, PE.  Has received 3-3.5L IVF
   with persistent hypotension. Reassuringly lactate improved from 2.7
   -->2.1-->1.3 with IVF.
   -continue to treat infection with IV Zosyn
   -surveillance blood cultures
   -giving 1U blood this morning, could give NS boluses PRN for MAP >65
   -liver u/s with dopppler to evaluate for venous thrombosis
   -hold antihypertensives
   -monitor hct, active T&S as below
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills. Prior history of
   GPR peritonitis and resistant e. coli bacteremia.  Ascites fluid
   transudative, does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission grew GNR with most likely source being biliary.
   -continue Zosyn, surveillance cultures as above
   # Poor PO intake:
   -slowly advance diet
   -nutrition recs, ensure
   # AF: Not anticoagulated, on BB, digoxin and amiodarone at home. RVR
   likely compensatory in setting of hypotension. Has been fluid
   responsive thus far .
   -continue dig and amio; check digoxin level this morning
   -hold BB for now given hypotension
   # Cholangiocarcinoma: Inoperable.  Per report, though not in [**Name (NI) 179**], pt
   received oral chemotherapy [**4-13**]. Plan for resumption of chemotherapy per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1183**].
   # Ascites: Likely related to portal hypertension (transudative) given
   diffuse liver metastases. Last para was five days prior to admission
   for 5L fluid removal.
   -f/u peritoneal fluid culture
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis today
   # Coronary artery disease:
   -continue ASA, plavix
   -holding off on BB for now as above for hypotension
   # Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit initially slightly above baseline,
   appeared hemoconcentrated, dropped from 34-28 with hydration, this is
   low normal for him. Today 23 is very low for him, although this is in
   the setting of IV hydration. Likely this is upper GI source, as bowel
   movements are not grossly bloody; cholangioCA is likely source.
   -continue ASA, plavix given significant CAD
   -[**Hospital1 **] hematocrits
   -keep active T&S
   -transfusing one unit this morning
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, and fever/chills. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including dehydration, portal hypertension, sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, blood pressure of 85/52 mmHg, pulse of 114 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and he is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 171 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 24 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 325 IU/L.

The patient's diagnosis is complicated by several factors, including dehydration, portal hypertension, sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of these factors, as well as his underlying medical condition.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued treatment of his infection with IV Zosyn, surveillance blood cultures, and administration of 1 unit of blood this morning. The patient's ascites is being managed with paracentesis, and his liver function tests are being monitored closely.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, chills, and elevated white blood cell count suggest that he may be developing sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac positive stool and elevated lactate level suggest that he may be bleeding from his gastrointestinal tract.
3. Portal hypertension: The patient's elevated liver function tests and ascites suggest that he may have portal hypertension.
4. Dehydration: The patient's low blood pressure and decreased urine output suggest that he may be dehydrated.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin level suggest that he may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including dehydration, portal hypertension, sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's treatment plan should be focused on managing these complications and addressing his underlying medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), decreased venous return in
   setting of malignancy/venous obstruction, sepsis, decompensated CHF,
   GIB in setting of guaiac positive stool, PE.  Has received 3-3.5L IVF
   with persistent hypotension. Reassuringly lactate improved from 2.7
   -->2.1-->1.3 with IVF.
   -continue to treat infection with IV Zosyn
   -surveillance blood cultures
   -giving 1U blood this morning, could give NS boluses PRN for MAP >65
   -liver u/s with dopppler to evaluate for venous thrombosis
   -hold antihypertensives
   -monitor hct, active T&S as below
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills. Prior history of
   GPR peritonitis and resistant e. coli bacteremia.  Ascites fluid
   transudative, does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission grew GNR with most likely source being biliary.
   -continue Zosyn, surveillance cultures as above
   # Poor PO intake:
   -slowly advance diet
   -nutrition recs, ensure
   # AF: Not anticoagulated, on BB, digoxin and amiodarone at home. RVR
   likely compensatory in setting of hypotension. Has been fluid
   responsive thus far .
   -continue dig and amio; check digoxin level this morning
   -hold BB for now given hypotension
   # Cholangiocarcinoma: Inoperable.  Per report, though not in [**Name (NI) 179**], pt
   received oral chemotherapy [**4-13**]. Plan for resumption of chemotherapy per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1183**].
   # Ascites: Likely related to portal hypertension (transudative) given
   diffuse liver metastases. Last para was five days prior to admission
   for 5L fluid removal.
   -f/u peritoneal fluid culture
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis today
   # Coronary artery disease:
   -continue ASA, plavix
   -holding off on BB for now as above for hypotension
   # Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit initially slightly above baseline,
   appeared hemoconcentrated, dropped from 34-28 with hydration, this is
   low normal for him. Today 23 is very low for him, although this is in
   the setting of IV hydration. Likely this is upper GI source, as bowel
   movements are not grossly bloody; cholangioCA is likely source.
   -continue ASA, plavix given significant CAD

   -keep active T&S

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, and fever/chills. The patient had a liver ultrasound, which showed normal patent hepatic vasculature, including main, right, and left portal veins, as well as right, middle, and left hepatic veins. The patient was found to have moderate ascites and was given albumin and normal saline for low urine output.

The patient's laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.3, hemoglobin of 8.4, and platelet count of 171. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) were abnormal, with elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. The patient's renal function was also impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.9 and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient was taking medications for these conditions, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and metformin.

The patient's current medications include:

* Omeprazole (Prilosec) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin sodium (Prophylaxis) for DVT prophylaxis
* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for infection
* Digoxin for atrial fibrillation
* Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Aspirin for coronary artery disease
* Clopidogrel for coronary artery disease
* Metformin for diabetes

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continuing Zosyn for infection
* Surveillance blood cultures
* Giving 1 unit of blood this morning
* Monitoring hemoglobin and active T&S
* Holding antihypertensives
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Continuing digoxin and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Holding metformin for diabetes

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and chills could be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
* Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of bleeding could increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of coronary artery disease could increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, which could increase the risk of respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function could increase the risk of renal failure, which could require dialysis.
* Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests could increase the risk of liver failure, which could require liver transplantation.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for developing medical complications, including sepsis, bleeding, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, renal failure, and liver failure. The patient's treatment plan should be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary to prevent these complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, and fever/chills. He has a history of cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. The patient's liver ultrasound is normal, and he has moderate ascites. He has had a large loose bowel movement with guaiac-positive stools and is currently asymptomatic with no pain, confusion, or disorientation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 87/54 mmHg. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and proton pump inhibitors. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, but normal liver function tests.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, chills, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's abdominal pain, elevated lipase levels, and guaiac-positive stools may indicate pancreatitis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stools and dark brown bowel movement suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Dehydration: The patient's low urine output and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate dehydration.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an infection.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and moderate ascites may indicate liver dysfunction.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and decreased partial pressure of oxygen may indicate respiratory failure.
9. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate nutritional deficiencies.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

 ASCITES
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Patient is a 73 yo male with history of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma
   now admitted to the ICU with significant findings of fatigue, chills,
   increased ascites and fever all consistent with sepsis.  Of note
   patient does have history of gastric outlet obstruction but active
   obstruction did not appear to be present. Admitted with evidence of
   hyptension/septic shock in the setting of recent paracentesis. He also
   appeared hypovolemic.
   IMP
   1) GNR septicemia/ hypotension - likely from biliary source exacerbated
   from impaired venous return/intravascular vol depletion.
   -Empiric Abx to continue
will need to follow culture results as Zosyn
   given intially
   -IVF/albumin bolus as needed
   -Will need to track CVP and CvO2
   -Check FeNa
   -check bladder pressure (may have hemodynamic effect on BP)
   2) Ascites - likely from underlying malignancy with liver mets
   -Follow abdominal exam
   -No need for pressors at this time
   -consider therapeutic para
   3) Acute Anemia/thrombocytopenia
   -likely dilutional but has some GI bleeding which will need to be
   followed - will likely require GI evaluation
   -Will need to trend HCT for concern of possible GI blood losses
   -PE unlikely and risk of GI bleed significant and will hold on further
   Rx
   4)Cholangiocarcinoma-
   -Will need to discuss ongoing Xeloda with primary oncology team in the
   setting of possible active infection
   Additional Issues to be addressed as defined in the note above. Patient
   remains full code. Goals of care will eventually need to be reassessed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, now admitted to the ICU with significant findings of fatigue, chills, increased ascites, and fever consistent with GNR sepsis. He has a history of gastric outlet obstruction, but active obstruction does not appear to be present. The patient is hypotensive and has evidence of hypovolemia, with a CVP of 10 mmHg and a SvO2 of 27%. He has also developed acute anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to dilutional causes, as well as possible GI bleeding.

The patient has been treated with empiric antibiotics, IV fluids, and albumin boluses as needed. He is currently being monitored for signs of septic shock and will need to be followed closely for any changes in his condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's GNR sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or hepatic dysfunction.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and hypovolemia can lead to further hemodynamic instability, including cardiac arrest or organ failure.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's acute anemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as his history of gastric outlet obstruction, increase his risk of GI bleeding, which can lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock or organ failure.
4. Infection-related complications: The patient's GNR sepsis can lead to infection-related complications, such as abscesses, pneumonia, or meningitis, which can further complicate his condition.
5. Malignancy progression: The patient's underlying cholangiocarcinoma can progress, leading to further complications, such as liver failure or metastasis to other organs.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's critical illness can lead to nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, which can further complicate his condition.
7. Psychological and emotional distress: The patient's critical illness can lead to psychological and emotional distress for the patient and his family, which can impact his overall well-being and recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills with prior history
   of GPR peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. Ascites fluid
   transudative and does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission growing pansensitive GNR with most likely source being
   biliary.
   -Will verify sensitivities with micro lab given h/o of cipro resistant
   E. coli but will likely switch pt to cipro for tx of pansensitive GNR
   given h/o cephalosporin allergy. Plan for total 14 day-course from
   first negative cultures.
   -F/u final cx data
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), sepsis. Less likely are decreased
   venous return in setting of malignancy/venous obstruction (patent
   hepatic vasculature on U/S), decompensated CHF, GIB in setting of
   guaiac positive stool, PE.  Resolved over course of day yesterday.
   -Treat infection as above
   -Monitor Hct, active T&S as below
   -Restart home beta blocker today
   # AF: Not anticoagulated - on BB, digoxin (therapeutic level) and
   amiodarone at home. Initial RVR likely compensatory in setting of
   hypotension but resolved with fluids.
   -Continue dig and amio
   -Restart BB with strict holding parameters given improved BP
   # Cholangiocarcinoma: Inoperable.  Per report, though not in [**Name (NI) 179**], pt
   received oral chemotherapy [**4-13**]. Plan for resumption of chemotherapy per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1183**].
   # Ascites: Likely related to portal hypertension (transudative) given
   diffuse liver metastases; cx NGTD. Last para was five days prior to
   admission for 5L fluid removal; pt with some discomfort.
   -F/u peritoneal fluid culture
   -Consider therapeutic paracentesis today
   -Pain meds prn
   # Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit initially slightly above baseline,
   likely hemoconcentrated. Concern for bleed in setting of drop yesterday
   but Hct remained stable after transfusion despite guaiac positive stool
   (?UGI source, likely cholangiocarcinoma); no evidence of hemolysis/DIC
   -Continue ASA, plavix given significant CAD
   -[**Hospital1 **] hematocrits, keep active T&S
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # Low platelets: Concern given >50% drop within 24 hours yesterday but
   likely dilutional rather than DIC (labs neg), HIT as improved on repeat
   labs.
   -Continue to trend
   # Coronary artery disease:
   -Continue ASA, plavix
   -Restart beta blocker today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, gastric outlet obstruction, and a history of gastric peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever/chills, increased ascites, and poor oral intake.

The patient has been receiving treatment for his infection, including antibiotics, and has shown some improvement. However, he continues to have low-grade temperatures and chills, and his ascites fluid is transudative.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, and is currently taking medications for these conditions. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show that he has a low platelet count, which is likely due to dilutional rather than DIC (labs negative). His hemoglobin level is slightly above baseline, and his hematocrit has remained stable despite guaiac-positive stool.

The patient's physical examination shows that he has mild crackles at the bases of his lungs, no wheezes, and a soft, distended abdomen with ascites. His extremities are without edema, and his radial and distal pulses are 2+.

The patient's diagnosis and plan include:

* Hypotension: likely due to dehydration, sepsis, or decreased venous return, and is being treated with antibiotics and fluids.
* Infection: likely due to biliary tract infection, and is being treated with antibiotics.
* Ascites: likely related to portal hypertension, and is being treated with paracentesis and antibiotics.
* Guaiac-positive stool: likely due to cholangiocarcinoma, and is being treated with antibiotics and anticoagulation.
* Low platelets: likely due to dilutional rather than DIC, and is being monitored.
* Coronary artery disease: is being treated with antiplatelet therapy and beta blockers.
* Diabetes: is being managed with sliding scale insulin and a diabetic diet.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Bleeding: due to his history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current platelet count.
* Infection: due to his current infection and his history of resistant E. coli bacteremia.
* Hypotension: due to dehydration, sepsis, or decreased venous return.
* Portal hypertension: due to his liver metastases.
* Coronary artery disease: due to his history of coronary artery disease and his current antiplatelet therapy.
* Diabetes: due to his history of diabetes and his current management.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued treatment of his infection with antibiotics.
* Monitoring of his platelet count and hematocrit.
* Management of his ascites with paracentesis and antibiotics.
* Management of his guaiac-positive stool with antibiotics and anticoagulation.
* Monitoring of his blood glucose levels and management of his diabetes.
* Management of his coronary artery disease with antiplatelet therapy and beta blockers.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills with prior history
   of GPR peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. Ascites fluid
   transudative and does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission growing pansensitive GNR with most likely source being
   biliary.
   -Start pt on cipro given pansensitive GNR for 14 day-course from first
   negative cultures
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis
   with likely associated fluid shifts), sepsis. Less likely are decreased
   venous return in setting of malignancy/venous obstruction (patent
   hepatic vasculature on U/S), decompensated CHF, GIB in setting of
   guaiac positive stool, PE.  Resolved over course of day yesterday.
   -Continue to treat infection with IV Zosyn and f/u cultures
   -Monitor hct, active T&S as below
   -Restart home beta blocker today
   # AF: Not anticoagulated - on BB, digoxin (therapeutic level) and
   amiodarone at home. Initial RVR likely compensatory in setting of
   hypotension but resolved with fluids.
   -Continue dig and amio
   -Restart BB with strict holding parameters given improved BP
   # Cholangiocarcinoma: Inoperable.  Per report, though not in [**Name (NI) 179**], pt
   received oral chemotherapy [**4-13**]. Plan for resumption of chemotherapy per
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1183**].
   # Ascites: Likely related to portal hypertension (transudative) given
   diffuse liver metastases; cx NGTD. Last para was five days prior to
   admission for 5L fluid removal; pt with some discomfort.
   -f/u peritoneal fluid culture
   -consider therapeutic paracentesis today
   -pain meds prn
   # Guaiac positive stool: Hematocrit initially slightly above baseline,
   likely hemoconcentrated. Concern for bleed in setting of drop yesterday
   but Hct remained stable after transfusion despite guaiac positive stool
   (?UGI source, likely cholangiocarcinoma); no evidence of hemolysis/DIC
   -continue ASA, plavix given significant CAD
   -[**Hospital1 **] hematocrits
   -keep active T&S
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   # Low platelets: Concern given >50% drop within 24 hours yesterday but
   likely dilutional rather than DIC (labs neg), HIT as improved on repeat
   labs.
   -Continue to trend
   # Coronary artery disease:
   -Continue ASA, plavix
   -Restart beta blocker today
   # Diabetes
   -Hold glipizide

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, who was admitted with hypotension, fever/chills, increased ascites, and poor oral intake. He has a history of gastric outlet obstruction and has undergone stenting. He was found to have a pansensitive GNR bacteremia and was started on ciprofloxacin for 14 days. He has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.

The patient's condition has been stable, with his hypotension resolving over the course of the day. His ascites fluid is transudative and does not meet criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He has been started on ciprofloxacin for 14 days and will continue to receive IV Zosyn and follow-up cultures.

The patient's platelet count has decreased by >50% within 24 hours, but this is likely due to dilutional rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He will continue to be monitored for bleeding and will receive ASA and plavix for his coronary artery disease.

The patient's guaiac-positive stool is likely related to his cholangiocarcinoma and not due to gastrointestinal bleeding. He will continue to receive pain medication as needed and will have his abdominal ascites fluid cultured.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and fever/chills increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stool and history of gastric outlet obstruction increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's >50% drop in platelet count within 24 hours increases the risk of DIC.

   73 year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with h/o
   gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting p/w hypotension, fever/chills,
   increased ascites and poor po intake.
   # Fevers/Chills: Pt had low grade temps with chills with prior history
   of GPR peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. Ascites fluid
   transudative and does not meet criteria for SBP.  Given history and
   abnormal abdominal anatomy, suspect GI source most likely, especially
   given normal CXR and oxygenation, normal UA.  Blood cultures from
   admission growing pansensitive GNR with most likely source being
   biliary.
   -Continue Zosyn pending cx data
   -Surveillance cx x 48 h?
   #  Hypotension: Ddx includes dehydration (s/p large volume paracentesis

   venous return in setting of malignancy/venous obstruction (patent
   hepatic vasculature on U/S), decompensated CHF, GIB in setting of
   guaiac positive stool, PE.  Resolved over course of day yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 73-year-old man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, gastric outlet obstruction, and a history of gastrointestinal peritonitis and resistant E. coli bacteremia. He was admitted with hypotension, fever, and chills, and was found to have ascites and poor oral intake. The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests, low platelets, and abnormal blood cultures.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient has a history of resistant E. coli bacteremia and is currently receiving IV Zosyn. There is a risk of continued sepsis and bacteremia, which may require adjustments to antibiotic therapy.
2. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may be due to dehydration, sepsis, or decreased venous return. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further episodes of hypotension.
3. **Poor Oral Intake:** The patient's poor oral intake may lead to malnutrition and dehydration, which can exacerbate his underlying condition.
4. **Cholangiocarcinoma:** The patient's inoperable cholangiocarcinoma may continue to progress, leading to further liver dysfunction and potential complications such as liver failure or portal hypertension.
5. **Ascites:** The patient's ascites may continue to accumulate, leading to respiratory compromise and potential complications such as respiratory failure.
6. **Low Platelets:** The patient's low platelets may be due to dilutional effects or HIT. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
7. **Coronary Artery Disease:** The patient's coronary artery disease may exacerbate his underlying condition, leading to cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
8. **Diabetes:** The patient's diabetes may require adjustments to his treatment regimen, particularly with regard to glucose control and potential complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
9. **Liver Dysfunction:** The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to further complications such as encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or bleeding.
10. **Respiratory Compromise:** The patient's respiratory compromise may lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment of his underlying conditions to prevent further complications and improve his overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, sepsis, and significant ascites. He has a history of gastric outlet obstruction and recent paracentesis. The patient is experiencing hypotension, acute anemia, thrombocytopenia, and GI bleeding. He is receiving empiric antibiotics and IV fluids, and his CVP and CvO2 are being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to his underlying condition and recent paracentesis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect any signs of deterioration.

2. GI Bleeding: The patient's GI bleeding may worsen, leading to further anemia, thrombocytopenia, and potentially life-threatening complications. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin and platelet count is essential.

3. Ascites: The patient's ascites may worsen, leading to respiratory compromise, cardiac tamponade, or bowel obstruction. Close monitoring of his abdominal exam and fluid balance is essential.

4. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's underlying cancer may progress, leading to further complications and potential organ failure. Close communication with the primary oncology team is essential to discuss ongoing treatment options.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding and potential organ failure. Close monitoring of his platelet count and platelet transfusions as needed are essential.

6. Acute Anemia: The patient's acute anemia may worsen, leading to further complications and potential organ failure. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin and transfusions as needed are essential.

7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to further complications and potential organ failure. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and vasopressor therapy as needed are essential.

8. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to his respiratory support and recent paracentesis. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and antibiotic therapy is essential.

9. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to his immobility and recent paracentesis. Close monitoring of his lower extremities and prophylactic therapy are essential.

10. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcer due to his underlying condition and recent paracentesis. Close monitoring of his gastric pH and prophylactic therapy are essential.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
