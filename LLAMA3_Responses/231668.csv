   Assessment and Plan
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Patient is a 32M with idiopathic dilated CM (EF 20%), afib, CVA, SDH,
   and hypothyroidism who is admitted for diuresis and milrinone.
   .
   # PUMP: CHF/Dilated Cardiomyopathy: TTE [**8-3**] showed EF 20%, diagnosed
   after presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**9-27**], thought to be
   viral etiology, s/p AICD. His dry weight is 100 kg, currently below dry
   weight at 93kg. Had recent admission at OSH where he presented with LE
   swelling and received IV lasix.  Currently does not appear volume
   overloaded, JVP flat, lungs clear and only trace edema. Plan as
   outlined by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]:
   - continue metoprolol 200mg tid to suppress arrythmogenic effects of
   milrinone
   - continue milrinone infusion at .5 mcg/kg/min, can titrate up to
   0.75mcg/kg/min.
   - Start to wean off milrinone late tonight
   - Maintain SBP>80, MAP>40
   - continue digoxin
   - continue lasix gtt, titrate to net negative ~1L daily, inc. to 10
   today
   - continue fluid restriction
   - continue low-dose ACEI
   .
   # RHYTHM: Chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, diagnosed in the
   setting of hyperthyroidism. Coumadin held [**Date range (1) 2788**] s/p SDH.
   Initially held this hospitalization for INR 3.5.  INR today 2.9
   - restart lower dose coumadin
   - uptitrate metoprolol as above
   .
   # h/o Ventricular Tachycardia: first noted in [**9-27**], had non sustained
   30 second run seen on Holter [**8-29**], s/p syncope from VT in [**9-1**].
   - monitor on telemetry
   - ICD in place
   - maintain K >4, Mg >2
   .
   # NEURO: s/p CVA as well as SDH. On Keppra for sz prophylaxis.
   Admitted to OSH in [**9-2**] after seizure at home and he was started on
   Keppra. Has been seizure free.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, chronic hypothyroidism, and a recent subdural hematoma. He was admitted to the ICU for diuresis and milrinone therapy. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 86/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His physical examination is notable for a supple neck, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and trace lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 165 x 10^9/L.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has acute on chronic systolic heart failure, and his plan includes continuing metoprolol to suppress arrhythmogenic effects of milrinone, titrating up to 0.75 mcg/kg/min, and weaning off milrinone late tonight. He will also be maintained on digoxin, lasix, and fluid restriction. His chronic atrial fibrillation will be restarted on Coumadin, and he will be monitored on telemetry.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure and atrial fibrillation increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and his oxygen saturation is slightly decreased. He is at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's baseline creatinine is elevated, and he is at risk for further renal impairment due to his heart failure and diuresis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's recent subdural hematoma and history of seizures increase his risk of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizure recurrence.
5. Infection complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent hospitalization increase his risk of infection, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and recent diuresis increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, and malabsorption.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding increase his risk of further bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and hematuria.
8. Osteoporotic complications: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and recent diuresis increase his risk of osteoporotic complications, such as fractures and osteoporosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC

   and hypothyroidism who is admitted for diuresis and milrinone.

   after presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**9-27**], thought to be
   viral etiology, s/p AICD. His dry weight is 100 kg, currently below dry
   weight at 93kg. Had recent admission at OSH where he presented with LE
   swelling and received IV lasix.  Currently does not appear volume
   overloaded, JVP flat, lungs clear and only trace edema. Plan as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
