 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of Pulmonary Fibrosis (home
   O2, 2L resting/ 4L ambulating), DM, CAD, PVD, s/p pacemaker who
   presents with 2 days of chest pain and worsening SOB likely worsening
   pulmonary fibrosis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Dyspnea: Pt with h/o pulmonary fibrosis with home 02 requirement of
   2-4L.  Prior clinic notes indicates that he desaturates to 82% with
   ambulation.  CXR did not reveal other acute process such as pneumonia
   or pulmonary edema and most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.  No
   clinical evidence of underlying infection or viral URI.  No fever,
   chills, worsening cough, or leukocytosis.  PE is on the differential,
   but not tachycardic and O2 sat improving. Also, ACS is a possibility
   although unlikely given clinical setting.  Likely worsening pulmonary
   fibrosis. Also may be developing worsening pulmonary HTN
   -- wean O2 as tolerated
   -- if respiratory status worsens then consider trial of BiPAP and
   steriods. Pt is DNR/DNI
   -- cont acetylcysteine 600mg TID
   -- albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn
   -- Continue azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia- day #[**1-30**]
   -- trend WBC and fever curve
   --Continue to diurese- 30mg IV x1 for now
   --Will get ECHO to evaluate for pulmonary HTN and possible PFO (get
   bubble study)
   .
   #. Chest pain: Pt with h/o CAD s/p RCA stent in 98. pMIBI in [**2180**]
   showed only fixed defects. No ECG changes and 1st set of CE trop 0.03,
   but CK flat. Currently CP free.  Unlikely ACS, but could represent
   angina. Also on the ddx PE, MSK, GERD.
   -- Patient refusing labs so have not been able to trend cardiac
   enzymes, will attempt this afternoon

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He presents with 2 days of chest pain and worsening shortness of breath.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
* Heart rate: 55-83 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 120/41-157/87 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula
* Heart rhythm: Ventricular-paced

The patient is on various medications, including furosemide, acetylcysteine, albuterol/ipratropium nebs, azithromycin, and statins. He is also on a cardiac-diabetic diet and has a glycaemic control plan in place.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Mild respiratory distress
* Dry crackles in the lung fields
* No wheeze or rhonchi
* Normal cardiac examination
* Alert and oriented to person, place, and time

The patient's laboratory results are pending, but his blood cultures are negative. His chest X-ray shows no acute process such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema, consistent with his diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis.

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning oxygen as tolerated
* Trial of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and steroids if respiratory status worsens
* Continuing acetylcysteine, albuterol/ipratropium nebs, and azithromycin
* Trending white blood cell and fever curves
* Continuing diuresis with furosemide
* Echocardiogram to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension and possible patent foramen ovale

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Pulmonary hypertension
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Dehydration
* Infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection
* Pulmonary embolism
* Acute coronary syndrome
* Gastrointestinal bleeding

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he has refused further laboratory tests, including cardiac enzymes. He is also refusing blood draws, which may make it challenging to monitor his condition."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He was admitted to the ICU with 2 days of chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. His current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure of 120/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He has a history of requiring 2-4 liters of oxygen at home and desaturates to 82% with ambulation. His chest X-ray did not reveal any acute process, and he does not have clinical evidence of infection or viral URI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary fibrosis and chronic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory compromise, requiring closer monitoring and potential trials of BiPAP and steroids.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and pacemaker placement increases his risk of cardiac complications, including angina or acute coronary syndrome.
3. Infection: Despite the absence of clinical evidence of infection, the patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis and chronic respiratory failure makes him more susceptible to respiratory infections, which could worsen his respiratory status.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's history of diabetes and cardiac disease increases his risk of fluid overload, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of cardiac complications.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's low sodium levels and diabetic status increase his risk of electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiac status.
6. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and immobility increase his risk of VTE, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiac status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with acute and chronic respiratory failure, desaturating to the 80s on supplemental oxygen. He has advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at baseline, with a subacute and now acute decline. The patient's chest X-ray shows possible increased opacities in the left base, which may indicate worsening pulmonary hypertension. He is refusing some medications, including blood draws, and has trace edema in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is desaturating to the 80s on supplemental oxygen. This increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute and chronic respiratory failure may lead to respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's advanced IPF and worsening pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
4. Sepsis: The patient's refusal of blood draws and some medications may indicate a potential septic episode.
5. Worsening of IPF: The patient's subacute and acute decline in IPF may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's worsening pulmonary hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's critical illness and respiratory failure may lead to malnutrition and dehydration.
8. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and respiratory status increase the risk of developing infections, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to monitor his respiratory status closely and consider intubation if his oxygenation worsens. Additionally, the patient's wife should be consulted regarding his wishes for home hospice care, and the patient's code status should be respected."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of weakness and shortness of breath (SOB). They have been admitted to the ICU and have been receiving treatment for respiratory failure, which is acute on chronic. The patient has a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and has experienced a subacute and now acute decline. They are desaturating to the 80s on supplemental oxygen and have possible increased opacities in the left base on their chest X-ray.

The patient is being treated with azithromycin and diuretics, and is being weaned off oxygen as tolerated. They have agreed to undergo an echocardiogram with bubble study and are being considered for anticoagulation based on their pulmonary pressures. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status and is being prioritized for discharge home as soon as possible.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute on chronic, and they are at risk of further decline. They may require mechanical ventilation or other respiratory support measures.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen if they do not consistently wear their oxygen and do not wear it with ambulation.
3. Exacerbation of IPF: The patient's IPF may exacerbate if they do not receive adequate treatment.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly pneumonia, due to their respiratory failure and compromised immune system.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase their risk of bleeding.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, and they may be at risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and they may be at risk of developing neurological complications such as seizures or brain edema."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He presents with 2 days of chest pain and worsening shortness of breath. The patient is refusing all care, including oxygen and blood draws.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has undergone an echocardiogram, which revealed mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The left ventricular function is normal, but there is a possible focal wall motion abnormality in the inferior wall that cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal technical quality.

The patient's laboratory results are not available due to his refusal of blood draws. His medications include azithromycin, which was started 2 days ago, and he is being continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed.

The patient's plan includes continuing acetylcysteine 600mg TID, albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn, and azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. He is also being managed with insulin sliding scale for his diabetes and a cardiac-diabetic diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to his refusal of oxygen therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and possible focal wall motion abnormality in the inferior wall may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's pacemaker and history of coronary artery disease may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's refusal of antibiotics and lack of laboratory results make it difficult to determine if he has an underlying infection.
5. Worsening of pulmonary fibrosis: The patient's chest pain and worsening shortness of breath may indicate worsening of his pulmonary fibrosis.

Overall, the patient's refusal of care and lack of laboratory results make it challenging to manage his condition effectively. It is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs and assessing his condition closely to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He is currently in the ICU due to worsening shortness of breath and chest pain. He is refusing all care, including oxygen, labs, and blood draws. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination is limited due to his refusal of care.

Echocardiogram results show a normal left atrium and ventricle, with mild thickening of the mitral and aortic valve leaflets. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is trace aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's plan includes weaning oxygen as tolerated, and considering trial of BiPAP and steroids if his respiratory status worsens. He is also being treated for possible atypical pneumonia with azithromycin. His chest pain is being managed with acetylcysteine and albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed. His diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and chest pain may indicate worsening pulmonary fibrosis, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and pulmonary hypertension may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's refusal of care may make it difficult to detect and treat any underlying infections, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension may increase his risk of pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure or cardiac complications.
5. Worsening kidney function: The patient's history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease may increase his risk of worsening kidney function, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and other complications."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and a pacemaker. He was admitted with 2 days of chest pain and worsening shortness of breath, likely due to worsening pulmonary fibrosis. The patient is currently refusing oxygen and laboratory tests, including blood draws.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. His respiratory support includes oxygen therapy with a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his refusal to cooperate. His peripheral vascular examination is not assessable, and his skin, neurologic, and abdominal examinations are not documented.

The patient's laboratory results are pending due to his refusal to undergo blood draws. His previous echocardiogram showed mild pulmonary artery hypertension, mild mitral regurgitation, and trace aortic regurgitation. His electrocardiogram showed no acute changes.

The patient's plan includes weaning oxygen as tolerated, considering a trial of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and steroids if his respiratory status worsens, and continuing azithromycin for possible atypical pneumonia. He is also receiving acetylcysteine and albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his refusal of oxygen therapy.
2. Infection: The patient's refusal of laboratory tests and antibiotics may increase the risk of developing an infection, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiac conditions.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or peripheral artery disease.
4. Worsening pulmonary hypertension: The patient's mild pulmonary artery hypertension may worsen over time, leading to further respiratory and cardiac complications.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes may lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, particularly if his oral medications are not controlled.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and diabetes may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or ischemia."

Summary:

The patient, a dyspneic individual, is currently in the ICU receiving supplemental oxygen and various medications, including metoprolol, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, simvastatin, lasix, heparin, and atrovent nebs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/107 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a SpO2 of 94%. The echocardiogram shows preserved right ventricular function, and there is no evidence of right-to-left shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's dyspnea and requirement for supplemental oxygen suggest that they may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of heart failure and the use of medications such as metoprolol and lasix may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and the use of invasive lines and devices may increase the risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications, such as heparin, and the presence of invasive lines and devices may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and the use of anticoagulant medications may increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
6. Hypotension: The patient's history of heart failure and the use of vasodilators such as metoprolol may increase the risk of hypotension.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's use of medications such as lasix and heparin may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of heart failure and the use of medications such as lasix may increase the risk of renal failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac function closely to prevent or identify these potential complications early."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

The patient is a [age] year-old who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, simvastatin, lasix, heparin, colace, azithromycin, and ASA 81.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 139/107 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula with aerosol-cool.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination is notable for a normal S1 heart sound and a loud P2 heart sound. The patient's respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion and crackles in the chest.

The patient's laboratory results are pending, but an echocardiogram shows preserved right ventricular function with no right-to-left shunt.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing home doses of oral lasix, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) if agreeable, and discontinuing IV lasix. The patient is planned to be discharged home with VNA services and will be considered for hospice care in the near future.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is 139/107 mmHg, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, including azithromycin, which may increase the risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition through ADAT, which may not be adequate for their needs.
6. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels are not monitored, which may lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their plan of care accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
