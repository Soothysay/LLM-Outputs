   - Patient initially started on Vanc and Zosyn.  Called from OSH with
   +Bl Cx GNR in [**2-11**] bottles.  Given one dose of gentamycin to double
   coverage GNR sepsis (rec by uro) insetting of possible prostatitis.
   - Low blood pressures: fluid boluses and maint fluids
   - K of 6 --> repeat K 5.3 after fluids. Lactate of 1.3.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:  60 yoM with history of ESRD and renal stones presenting
   with abdominal pain, found to have left pylonephritis and high
   suspecion for renal and prostate abscesses.
   PLAN:
   # Pylonephritis/renal and prostatic abscesses: Pt may have seeded
   urinary tract during recent urologic procedures. Possible causative
   organisms would include urinary flora (E. Coli, enterococcus, staph)
   versus MRSA given indwelling stent.  Patient went for IR drainage
   yesterday which resulted in 4cc bloody fluid from perinephric site and
   5cc pus like fluid from prostatic site.  There is some concern that the
   needle went through the prostate and drained the bladder.  Called by
   OSH for +BC
 GNR in
 bottles.  Lactate decreased with fluids and
   blood pressure responeded to fluids.
   - continue emperic broad coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin.  Add one
   dose of Gentamycin to double cover GNR.
   - follow-up blood and urinary cultures
   - hold all antihypertensives for now
   - pyridium and narcotics for pain control
   # ESRD: MWF schedule as above. Will notify renal of pt's presence so HD
   may continue.  Will hold ACEi for now as above.  Continue renagel.
   -HD today.
   # HTN: Hold antihypertensives for now given tenuous clinical status.
   Restart lisinopril and amlodipine when BP allows.
   # Anemia: No baseline for comparison. Will trend for now. Will send T&S
   given planned surgery.
   # Coagulopathy: INR 1.5 on admission. No prior history of liver
   disease, but will check LFTs. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to nutritional status.
   Will trend and give 1 mg Vitamin K in anticipation of surgery.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and renal stones, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with abdominal pain, suspected left pylonephritis, and high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses. Yesterday, he underwent interventional radiology (IR) drainage, which resulted in 4cc bloody fluid from the perinephric site and 5cc pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. The urologist is concerned that the needle may have drained the bladder instead of the prostate. The patient's blood pressure has been low, and he has received fluid boluses and maintenance fluids. His potassium level has decreased from 6 to 5.3, and his lactate level is 1.3. He is currently receiving empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn and vancomycin, and has been given one dose of gentamycin to double-cover against Gram-negative rod (GNR) sepsis. He is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) today.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and death if not promptly recognized and treated.
2. Prostate abscess: The IR drainage procedure may have caused the prostate abscess to spread or become more severe, potentially leading to further complications such as sepsis, abscess rupture, or urinary retention.
3. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing ESRD and the presence of renal and prostate abscesses increase the risk of acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's low blood pressure and need for fluid boluses and maintenance fluids suggest a high risk of hemodynamic instability, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.4 suggests a risk of coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially in the setting of invasive procedures or surgical interventions.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to his underlying ESRD and may worsen if not managed promptly.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is likely compromised due to his ESRD and may worsen if not addressed promptly.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress response may be triggered by his underlying illness, invasive procedures, or surgical interventions, which can lead to stress ulceration and bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Went to IR drained 4cc bloody fluid from peri nephric site and 5cc
   pus like fluid from prostatic site.  Uro concerned that IR may not have
   drained the prostate but rather the bladder.
   - Patient initially started on Vanc and Zosyn.  Called from OSH with
   +Bl Cx GNR in [**2-11**] bottles.  Given one dose of gentamycin to double
   coverage GNR sepsis (rec by uro) insetting of possible prostatitis.
   - Low blood pressures: fluid boluses and maint fluids
   - K of 6 --> repeat K 5.3 after fluids. Lactate of 1.3.
   - NPO for possiblity of TURP or repeat IR drainage in case clinically
   worse.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of ESRD and renal stones who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have left pyelonephritis and high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses.

The patient underwent IR drainage yesterday, which resulted in 4cc bloody fluid from the perinephric site and 5cc pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. However, there is concern that the needle may have drained the bladder instead of the prostate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with Zosyn and vancomycin, and a single dose of gentamycin was added to double-cover GNR sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's kidney function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 7.6 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 26.3 mL/min.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's elevated lactate level and hypotension may indicate septic shock, which requires immediate attention and management.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's compromised kidney function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury, which could require dialysis.
3. Prostate abscess rupture: The patient's prostate abscess may rupture, leading to peritonitis, sepsis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and platelet count may indicate a coagulopathy, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to stress.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to decreased immune function, impaired wound healing, and increased risk of complications.
8. Wound infection: The patient's surgical wounds may become infected, leading to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on these findings, I recommend that the patient continue to receive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, and that the patient's laboratory results be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, organ dysfunction, and other complications."

   with the findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 5708**] was admitted with
   urosepsis, including hypotension and positive blood cultures.  Today he
   is doing much better.  His blood pressure, while not his norm, is
   certainly adequate for perfusion and has only  needed fluids, not
   pressors. Lactate much improved. He also feels better and even is
   demanding to eat! We will give double GNR coverage for a couple more
   days, but I think his Vancomycin can be stopped, as no evidence of a
   GPC infection. He should remain in MICU for at least another day, but
   hopefully soon thereafter he will be stable enough for transfer to the
   wards with urology f/u.  35 min spent in the care of this critically
   ill patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Went to IR drained 4cc bloody fluid from peri nephric site and 5cc
   pus like fluid from prostatic site.  Uro concerned that IR may not have
   drained the prostate but rather the bladder.
   - Patient initially started on Vanc and Zosyn.  Called from OSH with
   +Bl Cx GNR in [**2-11**] bottles.  Given one dose of gentamycin to double
   coverage GNR sepsis (rec by uro) insetting of possible prostatitis.
   - Low blood pressures: fluid boluses and maint fluids
   - K of 6 --> repeat K 5.3 after fluids. Lactate of 1.3.
   - NPO for possiblity of TURP or repeat IR drainage in case clinically
   worse.
   - Will get HD today.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT:  60 yoM with history of ESRD and renal stones presenting
   with abdominal pain, found to have left pylonephritis and high
   suspecion for renal and prostate abscesses.
   PLAN:
   # Pylonephritis/renal and prostatic abscesses: Pt may have seeded
   urinary tract during recent urologic procedures. Possible causative
   organisms would include urinary flora (E. Coli, enterococcus, staph)
   versus MRSA given indwelling stent.  Patient went for IR drainage
   yesterday which resulted in 4cc bloody fluid from perinephric site and
   5cc pus like fluid from prostatic site.  There is some concern that the
   needle went through the prostate and drained the bladder.  Called by
   OSH for +BC
 GNR in
 bottles.  Lactate decreased with fluids and
   blood pressure responeded to fluids.
   - continue emperic broad coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin.  Add one
   dose of Gentamycin to double cover GNR.
   - follow-up blood and urinary cultures
   - hold all antihypertensives for now
   - pyridium and narcotics for pain control
   # ESRD: MWF schedule as above. Will notify renal of pt's presence so HD
   may continue.  Will hold ACEi for now as above.  Continue renagel.
   -HD today.
   # HTN: Hold antihypertensives for now given tenuous clinical status.
   Restart lisinopril and amlodipine when BP allows.
   # Anemia: No baseline for comparison. Will trend for now. Will send T&S
   given planned surgery.
   # Coagulopathy: INR 1.5 on admission. No prior history of liver
   disease, but will check LFTs. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to nutritional status.
   Will trend and give 1 mg Vitamin K in anticipation of surgery.
   # FEN: feed him today if not getting procedure.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and renal stones, who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have left pyelonephritis and high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses. The patient underwent IR drainage yesterday, which resulted in bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. The patient was started on empiric broad coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin, and one dose of gentamycin was added to double cover GNR sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 73 bpm
* Blood pressure: 107/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 18.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 36.1%
* Platelet count: 141 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 7.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 69 mg/dL
* Glucose: 69 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Well appearing adult male, moderate discomfort
* Chest: Clear
* Abdomen: Positive voluntary guarding with rebound tenderness
* Genitourinary: Positive CVA tenderness, mostly on the left
* Extremities: Warm, without edema

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Severe sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of GNR sepsis
* Renal or prostate abscesses, which may lead to further complications such as peritonitis or sepsis
* Urosepsis, which may lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury or septic shock
* Coagulopathy, which may lead to bleeding or hemorrhage
* Anemia, which may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cognitive function
* Hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, or myocardial infarction

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue empiric broad coverage with Zosyn and vancomycin, and add one dose of gentamycin to double cover GNR sepsis
* Follow-up blood and urinary cultures
* Hold all antihypertensives for now
* Pyridium and narcotics for pain control
* HD today
* Continue renagel
* Restart lisinopril and amlodipine when BP allows
* Trend for anemia and send T&S given planned surgery
* Check LFTs and give 1 mg Vitamin K in anticipation of surgery
* Feed the patient today if not getting procedure"

   On this day I examined this patient and was present for the key
   portions of the care provided.  I have reviewed  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note above
   and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 5759**] looks great
   today, and is eating and walking in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].  His BP is fine and
   overall he seems to have resolved his pseudomonal sepsis from prostatic
   abscess, which has been drained, and for which he is on Zosyn.  Plan is
   to transfer to the floor later today. Urology will follow but so far
   have advised continuing the Foley cath for now and continuing
   antibiotics for [**5-15**] wks.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: prostatic abscess s/p drainage
   24 Hour Events:
   - hemodialysis- no fluid removed
   - micro data- GNR in urine, prostatic abscess fluid, and [**2-11**] bcx; (from
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital [**6-8**]: Pseudomonas aeroginosa 2/2 blood cultures,
   no sensitivities yet)
   - stopped vancomycin, continued Zosyn and gentamicin
   - urology recs- keep stent in, to be removed by outpatient urologist
   once infection clears in [**3-15**] weeks; keep foley to gravity until
   discharge, once afebrile and no leukocytosis; start flomax and proscar;
   continue antibiotics for 4-6 weeks for prostatitis; ADAT
   - renal recs- increase Zosyn to 2.25g IV q8h; dose gent by level, stop
   maintanence fluids
   - access- PIV x3
   - goal I+O- slightly positive overnight
   - CXR- probable subsegmental atelectasis or scarring at the left base.
   Consider followup imaging to exclude progression to infiltrate, if
   clinically indicated. No CHF. Right IJ line tip, as described. No ptx.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 60 year-old man with history of ESRD and renal stones presenting with
   abdominal pain, found to have left pylonephritis and high suspecion for
   renal and prostate abscesses.
   # Pylonephritis/renal and prostatic abscesses: now s/p IR drainage [**6-9**]
   which resulted in 4 cc bloody fluid from perinephric site and 5 cc pus
   like fluid from prostatic site. OSH blood cultures are growing
   Pseudomonas in [**3-13**] culture bottles, sensitivities pending. So far
   patient received vanco and gent x1 dose. Currently on Zosyn for empiric
   Pseudomonas coverage.
   -continue empiric broad coverage with Zosyn
   -follow-up blood culture sensitivites from OSH and tailor antibiotics
   accordingly
   -hold all antihypertensives for now
   -pyridium and narcotics for pain control; could switch Dilaudid to po
   form if tolerating pos
   -tamsulosin and finasteride per urology
   -[**5-15**] week antibiotic course per urology, stent removal after he clears
   infection
   # ESRD: MWF schedule as above.
   -continue Renagel
   -HD per renal
   # HTN: hold antihypertensives for now given tenuous clinical status.
   Restart lisinopril and amlodipine when BP allows.
   # Anemia: no baseline for comparison. Guiaic negative on exam. Likely
   from ESRD +/- marrow suppression from acute illness.
   -iron studies and reticulocyte count pending
   -active type and screen
   -transfuse for hct <21
   # Coagulopathy: INR 1.5 on admission. No prior history of liver disease
   and LFTs were normal. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to nutritional status. INR
   improved to 1.1 after 1 mg vitamin K.
   -no active concerns

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of ESRD and renal stones who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have left pyelonephritis and high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses. He underwent IR drainage, which resulted in bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. Blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas, and he has received vancomycin and gentamicin. He is currently on Zosyn for empiric Pseudomonas coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonas sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas, and he is at risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Renal and prostate abscesses: The patient has not cleared the abscesses, and there is a risk of recurrence or progression to more severe complications.
3. Urosepsis: The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and there is a risk of developing urosepsis, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Pseudomonas pneumonia: The patient has a history of ESRD and is at risk of developing Pseudomonas pneumonia, which can be life-threatening.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and there is a risk of bleeding complications if not properly managed.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can worsen his overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
7. Infection control: The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, and there is a risk of developing infections related to these devices.
8. Kidney transplant: The patient's brother has offered to donate a kidney, but the patient is not aware of this plan and may not agree to it.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric broad coverage with Zosyn and follow up on blood culture sensitivities.
2. Hold all antihypertensives for now and restart when the patient's BP allows.
3. Advance diet as tolerated and monitor for signs of malnutrition.
4. Monitor for signs of coagulopathy and anemia.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal and prostate abscesses and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Consider transferring the patient to the floor later today, but ensure that his condition is stable and that he is able to receive proper care.
7. Consider discussing the kidney transplant option with the patient and his family, but prioritize the patient's current medical needs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint: prostatic abscess s/p drainage
   24 Hour Events:
   - hemodialysis- no fluid removed
   - micro data- GNR in urine, prostatic abscess fluid, and [**2-11**] bcx; (from
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital [**6-8**]: Pseudomonas aeroginosa 2/2 blood cultures,
   no sensitivities yet)
   - stopped vancomycin, continued Zosyn and gentamicin
   - urology recs- keep stent in, to be removed by outpatient urologist
   once infection clears in [**3-15**] weeks; keep foley to gravity until

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and renal stones, who was admitted with abdominal pain and was found to have left pyelonephritis and high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses. He underwent IR drainage, which resulted in bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. Blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas, and he is currently on Zosyn for empiric coverage.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: stable with a blood pressure of 126/59 mmHg and a heart rate of 75 bpm.
* Respiratory support: no oxygen therapy is required.
* Abdominal examination: positive voluntary guarding with rebound tenderness, and a positive CVA tenderness.
* Prostate examination: ""exquisitely tender and boggy"" prostate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonas sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are growing Pseudomonas, which can lead to sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Renal and prostate abscesses: The patient's condition may worsen if the abscesses are not properly drained and treated.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ESRD and marrow suppression from acute illness.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be related to nutritional status or other underlying conditions.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may worsen if antihypertensives are not restarted when clinically indicated.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the urinary tract and prostate.

Plan:

1. Continue empiric broad coverage with Zosyn until blood culture sensitivities are available.
2. Follow-up blood culture sensitivities and tailor antibiotics accordingly.
3. Hold all antihypertensives for now and restart when clinically indicated.
4. Continue Renagel and HD per renal.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and coagulopathy, and consider transfusing for a hematocrit <21.
6. Advance diet as tolerated and monitor the patient's glycemic control.
7. Consider further imaging studies to exclude progression to infiltrate in the left base of the lung.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: prostatic abscess s/p drainage
   24 Hour Events:
   - hemodialysis- no fluid removed

   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 13**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital [**6-8**]: Pseudomonas aeroginosa 2/2 blood cultures,
   no sensitivities yet)
   - stopped vancomycin, continued Zosyn and gentamicin
   - urology recs- keep stent in, to be removed by outpatient urologist
   once infection clears in [**3-15**] weeks; keep foley to gravity until
   discharge, once afebrile and no leukocytosis; start flomax and proscar;
   continue antibiotics for 4-6 weeks for prostatitis; ADAT
   - renal recs- increase Zosyn to 2.25g IV q8h; dose gent by level, stop
   maintanence fluids
   - access- PIV x3
   - goal I+O- slightly positive overnight
   - CXR- probable subsegmental atelectasis or scarring at the left base.
   Consider followup imaging to exclude progression to infiltrate, if
   clinically indicated. No CHF. Right IJ line tip, as described. No ptx.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and renal stones, admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, suspected left pyelonephritis, and high suspicion for renal and prostate abscesses. He underwent IR drainage, resulting in bloody fluid from the perinephric site and pus-like fluid from the prostatic site. Blood cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and he is currently on Zosyn for empiric coverage. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.9°C, HR of 75 bpm, and SpO2 of 94%. His physical examination reveals positive voluntary guarding with rebound tenderness in the abdomen, and the prostate is tender and boggy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive kidney damage due to the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the blood cultures, which may require adjustments to antibiotic therapy.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of bacteria in the blood and the patient's underlying ESRD.
3. Complications related to the urinary tract infection, such as pyelonephritis or renal abscesses, which may require further drainage or surgical intervention.
4. Complications related to the prostate abscess, such as prostatitis or sepsis, which may require further antibiotic therapy or surgical intervention.
5. Potential for bleeding or hematoma due to the patient's history of ESRD and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Potential for electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances due to the patient's underlying ESRD and kidney function.
7. Potential for infection or sepsis related to the indwelling urinary catheter or central venous catheter.
8. Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's history of ESRD and anticoagulation therapy.
9. Potential for respiratory complications due to the patient's underlying ESRD and potential for fluid overload.
10. Potential for cardiovascular complications due to the patient's underlying ESRD and potential for fluid overload.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely, and to adjust his antibiotic therapy and other medical interventions as needed to prevent or manage potential complications."
