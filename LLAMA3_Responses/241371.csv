   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: Unclear as to prognosis. Pt minimally responsive. Pt
   evaluated by neuro. Plan for MRI and EEG to better assess long-term
   prognosis
   - f/u neuro
   - MRI today
   - EEG today
   - family meeting
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 11 day course for VAP.
   -CXR daily
   -Resume heparin gtt
   -Family meeting today to discuss long term goals of care- and if neuro
   function intact will plan for trach/peg
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.
   -Presume [**12-23**] sedation vs anemia
   -wean Vasopressin and will use levophed for MAP>65
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however given slow down
   trend in Hct suspect oozing.
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   - GI following; plan for possible c-scope pending neuro status/goals of
   care
   -Pt has CVL and PICC in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Pending GI evaluation; may need consideration for IVC filter
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Hold aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) complicated by post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) and aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient's respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. He has been treated with Cefepime and Zosyn, and his antibiotics were changed to Zosyn after a repeat CXR showed a new left-sided infiltrate.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of CAD and has had a cardiac arrest in the past. He is currently on Sotalol and has a left ventricular thrombus.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) and is at risk for further bleeding due to his anticoagulant therapy.
* Neurological: The patient's mental status is unclear due to his sedation and intubation. He is being evaluated by neurology and will undergo an MRI and EEG to assess his long-term prognosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise is multifactorial, and he may require further respiratory support.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed and is at risk for further bleeding due to his anticoagulant therapy.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has had a cardiac arrest in the past. He may be at risk for further cardiac complications.
* Neurological complications: The patient's mental status is unclear due to his sedation and intubation, and he may require further neurological evaluation to assess his long-term prognosis.
* Infection: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia/HAP and may be at risk for further infection.
* Thrombotic complications: The patient has a left ventricular thrombus and is at risk for further thrombotic complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue respiratory support as needed.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
* Continue cardiovascular medications as prescribed.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as necessary.
* Continue infection prevention measures, including antibiotics and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Monitor the patient's thrombotic risk and adjust anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
* Consider further diagnostic testing, including MRI and EEG, to assess the patient's long-term prognosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however given slow down
   trend in Hct suspect oozing.  Hct has been stable overnight s/p 1U prbc
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   - GI following; plan for possible c-scope pending neuro status/goals of
   care
   -Pt has CVL and PICC in place
   .
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now; day #11 of zosyn, day #2 vanc (may d/c
   today given negative cultures)
   -CXR this AM
   -Resume heparin gtt
   -Family meeting today to discuss long term goals of care- and if neuro
   function intact will plan for trach/peg
   .
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB
   -Presume [**12-23**] sedation vs anemia
   -wean Vasopressin and will use levophed for MAP>65
   -Send lactate
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Pending GI evaluation; may need consideration for IVC filter
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Hold aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   # PPX: H2 blocker, hold anti-coagulation for now, bowel regimen

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring prolonged intubation. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and was previously treated for atrial fibrillation (AF) after a cardiac arrest in 2014. He was also treated for a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) and has a history of anemia.

Current medical conditions:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP
* Gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) with presumed oozing
* Hypotension due to infection, sedation, or gastrointestinal bleed
* LV thrombus and PE requiring anticoagulation
* Borderline diabetes requiring insulin therapy
* History of CAD with cardiac arrest in 2014 and atrial fibrillation

Current treatment:

* Vasopressin infusion for hypotension
* Heparin infusion for PE and LV thrombus
* Cefepime and Zosyn antibiotics for pneumonia
* Glycemic control with Lantus insulin
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers
* VAP prevention measures

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of respiratory failure due to continued pulmonary embolism and aspiration pneumonia
2. Further gastrointestinal bleeding due to continued oozing or underlying gastrointestinal disease
3. Hypotension due to continued infection, sedation, or gastrointestinal bleed
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
5. Complications related to prolonged intubation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheal stenosis
6. Potential need for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) if neurologic function improves
7. Risk of cardiac complications due to history of CAD and atrial fibrillation
8. Potential need for IVC filter placement due to recurrent pulmonary embolism
9. Risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive devices
10. Potential need for further diagnostic testing, such as MRI and EEG, to evaluate anoxic brain injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 37 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has developed multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which is likely due to pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD.
2. Uncertain mental status: The patient's mental status is unclear, and there is possible seizure activity on EEG. The plan is to continue EEG monitoring and anti-seizure treatment.
3. Refractory hypotension: The patient has refractory hypotension on vasopressin, and the plan is to wean off vasopressin and use Levophed if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is less than 65.
4. GI bleed: The patient has a GI bleed, and the plan is to follow serial hemoglobin (Hct) levels, with a goal Hct of 25.
5. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, and is being treated with sotalol and heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure, GI bleed, and possible pneumonia make him susceptible to sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's refractory hypotension and history of cardiac disease make him at risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Stroke: The patient's uncertain mental status and possible seizure activity on EEG make him at risk for stroke.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further decline in his condition.
5. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may worsen, leading to further complications.
6. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure, GI bleed, and possible pneumonia make him susceptible to infection.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's cardiac disease, respiratory failure, and possible sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his symptoms, as well as to consider further interventions, such as MRI, to determine the extent of his cerebral function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current condition is marked by persistent respiratory failure, uncertain mental status, refractory hypotension on vasopressin, and GI bleed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg. The patient is receiving vasopressin, heparin, and other medications to manage his condition.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 233 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of bilateral hilar infil and effusions on CXR, and an echo shows an EF of 45% with apical and ant AK.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Uncertain mental status: The patient is sedated and has uncertain mental status, with brainstem function intact but extent of cerebral function uncertain. An EEG and possible MRI are planned.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, with causes including pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD. Empiric antibiotics are being administered, and the patient is being monitored for diuresis.
3. Refractory hypotension: The patient is pressor-dependent and has unclear etiology or if the patient even needs beta blockers. Consideration is being given to occult infection, GI bleed, and possible occult bleeding.
4. GI bleed: The patient has a GI bleed, and a scope has been deferred pending family meeting. The patient is being monitored for serial HCT, with a goal HCT of 25.
5. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient is on sotalol and heparin gtt, and ASA and BB are being held. An echo has been reviewed without LV thrombus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary edema
* PE
* COPD exacerbation
* GI bleed
* Hypotension
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Stroke
* Sepsis
* Multi-organ failure

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies to ensure that he receives appropriate treatment and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: Unclear as to prognosis. Pt minimally responsive. Pt
   evaluated by neuron with intact brain stem function. MRI done and
   results pending. EEG shows seizure activity, now s/p loading with
   Fosphenytoin- on final read of EEG no seizure activity and slowing
   suggestive of encephalopathy. MRI without evidence of anoxic brain
   injury
   -Continue Fosphenytoin for now pending neuro recs, pt has ongoing EEG
   monitor in place
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin at 7pm tonight prior to next dose
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required vasopressin
   and then levophed, howver now off since 9am today and BP stable so far
   -Resume  Levophed prn to maintain MAP>65
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus- hold at MN prior to trach
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -- spoke with wife regarding goals of care. Would like to pursue trach
   and PEG for now. If pt without any improvement in mental status will
   consider withdrawl of care later on.
   -- neurology: pt with brainstem and likely cortical function. Need to
   further assess.
   -- EEG showed likely seizure activity. Pt placed on 24hr EEG
   monitoring. Started fosphenytoin 1500mg x1 then 150mg q8.
   -- IP consulted for trach and PEG, plan for Friday
   Would like us to get LENI in AM to r/o DVT. If + needs IVC filter via
   IR
   -- vasopressin weaned off
   -- pt hypotensive with SBP 80's improved initially with 500cc bolus x2
   -- started levophed for SBP 70-80's
   -- placed a-line
   -- worsening hypoxia and increased to FiO2 100% and PEEP 15
   -- 7.37/49/165/29 --> FiO2 to 50%
   -- MRI performed
   -- 7.4/39/104 --> PEEP being titrated 8

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: Unclear as to prognosis. Pt minimally responsive. Pt
   evaluated by neuron with intact brain stem function. MRI done and
   results pending. EEG shows seizure activity, now s/p loading with
   Fosphenytoin- on final read of EEG no seizure activity and slowing
   suggestive of encephalopathy. MRI without evidence of anoxic brain
   injury
   -Continue Fosphenytoin for now pending neuro recs, pt has ongoing EEG
   monitor in place
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin at 7pm tonight prior to next dose
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required vasopressin
   and then levophed, howver now off since 9am today and BP stable so far
   -Resume  Levophed prn to maintain MAP>65
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus- hold at MN prior to trach
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now , plan for PEG

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) complicated by post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring prolonged intubation, with a subsequent drop in hemoglobin (Hct) and presumed lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient's mental status is unclear, and he is minimally responsive. He has been treated with fosphenytoin for seizure activity, and his EEG shows slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG shows seizure activity, which may indicate a higher risk of seizures in the future.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's EEG also shows slowing suggestive of encephalopathy, which may indicate a higher risk of brain injury or death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of LGIB, which may be related to diverticulosis, AVM, or malignancy.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he has required vasopressin and levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.
6. LV thrombus/PE: The patient has a LV thrombus and PE, which may require long-term anticoagulation.
7. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of CAD, AF, and a cardiac arrest, which may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, including aspiration pneumonia/HAP and LGIB, which may increase his risk of sepsis and organ failure.

Plan:

1. Continue fosphenytoin for seizure activity and encephalopathy.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Continue anticoagulation for LV thrombus/PE.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Consider workup for gastrointestinal bleeding, including endoscopy and imaging studies.
6. Continue anticoagulation for PE and LV thrombus.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust therapy as needed.
8. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and antacids to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Continue glycemic control and nutrition support.
10. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: Unclear as to prognosis. Pt minimally responsive. Pt
   evaluated by neuron with intact brain stem function. MRI done and
   results pending. EEG shows seizure activity, now s/p loading with
   Fosphenytoin.
   -Continue Fosphenytoin and check levels?
   - f/u neuro
   - F/U MRI
   # Respiratory: Pts respiratory compromise is multifactorial, including
   pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He has been
   treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing Enterobacter
   aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**]
   showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he was to
   complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- [**Month (only) 8**] be [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left sided pna on
   CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Persistant despite
   IVF bolus; now weaned off vasopressin and started levophed
   -Continue Levophed MAP>65
   -F/U Culture data
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however given slow down
   trend in Hct suspect oozing.
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   - GI following; plan for possible c-scope pending neuro status/goals of
   care
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight; f/u result b/c if evidence of clot will need
   IVC filter prior to Trach/Peg by IR
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -- spoke with wife regarding goals of care. Would like to pursue trach
   and PEG for now. If pt without any improvement in mental status will
   consider withdrawl of care later on.
   -- neurology: pt with brainstem and likely cortical function. Need to
   further assess.
   -- EEG showed likely seizure activity. Pt placed on 24hr EEG
   monitoring. Started fosphenytoin 1500mg x1 then 150mg q8.
   -- IP consulted for trach and PEG, plan for Friday
   Would like us to get LENI in AM to r/o DVT. If + needs IVC filter via
   IR
   -- vasopressin weaned off
   -- pt hypotensive with SBP 80's improved initially with 500cc bolus x2
   -- started levophed for SBP 70-80's
   -- placed a-line
   -- worsening hypoxia and increased to FiO2 100% and PEEP 15
   -- 7.37/49/165/29 --> FiO2 to 50%
   -- MRI performed
   -- 7.4/39/104 --> PEEP being titrated 8

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of CAD and COPD who presented after a MVC and developed post-op PE, LGIB, and respiratory failure. He has been intubated for prolonged periods and has had multiple episodes of hypotension. The patient's mental status is unclear, and he is minimally responsive. An EEG showed seizure activity, and he was started on fosphenytoin. The patient has a LV thrombus and PE, and an IVC filter is being considered. He has a history of cardiac arrest and is taking sotalol. The patient has borderline DM and is NPO, with a plan for PEG.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG showed seizure activity, and he is being treated with fosphenytoin. However, the patient's mental status is unclear, and there is a risk of further seizure activity.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is at risk of further respiratory compromise.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had multiple episodes of gastrointestinal bleed, including LGIB and GIB, and is at risk of further bleeding.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension and is at risk of further hypotension, particularly with the use of sedatives and vasopressors.
5. Infection: The patient has had multiple episodes of infection, including pneumonia and VAP, and is at risk of further infection.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient has a LV thrombus and PE, and is at risk of further thrombotic complications, including DVT and pulmonary embolism.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is taking sotalol, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient is NPO and has a plan for PEG, but is at risk of malnutrition and dehydration.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and seizure activity closely.
2. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory status, including adjusting ventilator settings and monitoring for signs of respiratory failure.
3. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleed, including monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting treatment as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as needed to prevent hypotension.
5. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for thrombotic complications, including DVT and pulmonary embolism.
7. Continue to monitor the patient for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment as needed to prevent malnutrition and dehydration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. He has been experiencing persistent respiratory failure, GI bleed, and uncertain mental status. His current conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: persistent, with possible causes including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD
* Uncertain mental status: brainstem function intact, but extent of cerebral function uncertain
* GI bleed: stable Hct, planning for eventual scope and follow-up
* Shock: resolved, but still being monitored
* CAD/CHF/AFIB: on sotalol and heparin gtt, ASA and BB held

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory arrest, or cardiac arrest
2. Uncertain mental status: worsening encephalopathy, seizure activity, or brainstem dysfunction
3. GI bleed: further bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation, or sepsis
4. Shock: recurrence, cardiac arrest, or multi-organ failure
5. CAD/CHF/AFIB: worsening cardiac function, cardiac arrest, or arrhythmias
6. Infections: development of secondary infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or VAP
7. Metabolic complications: hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances
8. Hemodynamic instability: worsening hypotension or hypertension
9. Neurological complications: worsening encephalopathy, seizure activity, or brainstem dysfunction

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider tracheostomy and PEG placement.
2. Minimize sedation and consider fosphenytoin therapy for possible seizure activity.
3. Continue empiric antibiotics and follow-up cultures.
4. Monitor the patient's GI bleed and plan for eventual scope and follow-up.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider adjusting therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte and glucose levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and consider adjusting therapy as necessary.
9. Consider neurological consultation to further evaluate the patient's mental status and potential seizure activity."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current condition is marked by:

1. Uncertain mental status: The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history, with a recent EEG showing evidence of seizure activity, although the final report did not confirm seizure activity. The patient's brainstem function is intact, but the extent of cerebral function is uncertain.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, with a high risk of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.
3. Shock: The patient has had refractory hypotension, requiring vasopressor support, and has been weaned off vasopressin.
4. GI bleed: The patient has had a recent GI bleed, with stable hemoglobin levels, and is at risk for further bleeding.
5. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and atrial fibrillation, with ongoing treatment with sotalol and heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG showed evidence of seizure activity, which could indicate a high risk of seizure recurrence.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure could lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, and may require tracheostomy and PEG placement.
3. Shock: The patient's refractory hypotension could indicate a high risk of further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
4. GI bleeding: The patient's recent GI bleed could lead to further bleeding complications, such as bleeding from the PEG tube or bleeding from the respiratory tract.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and atrial fibrillation could lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or heart failure.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - In light of no seizure activity, would discontinue Fosphenytoin,
   confirm with neuro
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin this AM
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach, now with multifactorial respiratory failure,
   including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He
   has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat
   CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he
   was to complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now , plan for PEG

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The 72-year-old male patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including CAD, COPD, and a history of cardiac arrest. He has been in the ICU for an extended period, with a prolonged intubation after a MVC complicated by post-op PE, LGIB, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.

The patient's current status is as follows:

1. Neurological: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic encephalopathy. EEG shows no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
2. Respiratory: S/P Trach, with multifactorial respiratory failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.
3. Cardiovascular: LV thrombus, PE post-op, and a history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation.
4. Gastrointestinal: LGIB, with a differential diagnosis including diverticulosis vs AVM vs malignancy.
5. Hemodynamic: Hypotension has been resolved, but the patient is still receiving cautious diuresis to improve respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued respiratory failure, which may require further interventions such as tracheostomy and PEG.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or further LV thrombus formation.
4. Neurological complications, such as further encephalopathy or seizures.
5. Infection, including VAP and DVT, which may require further antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Cautious diuresis to improve respiratory status.
2. Continued heparin gtt for PE.
3. Monitoring of sedation and lightening if possible to monitor mental status.
4. Fosphenytoin discontinuation, pending neuro consultation.
5. Plan for tracheostomy and PEG tomorrow.
6. Continued antibiotic treatment for VAP and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.
7. Monitoring of glycemic control and adjusting insulin regimen as needed.
8. Holding anti-HTNs and aspirin until further evaluation and treatment for LGIB.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - In light of no seizure activity, would discontinue Fosphenytoin,
   confirm with neuron
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin at 7pm tonight prior to next dose
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach, now with multifactorial respiratory failure,
   including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He
   has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat
   CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he
   was to complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day __ 12 day course for VAP; will continue
   given ongoing hypotension
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and subsequent post-operative pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring prolonged intubation. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a previous cardiac arrest. He was also diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and has undergone various treatments, including heparin, antibiotics, and vasopressors.

Current Status:

The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to metabolic encephalopathy. His respiratory status is multifactorial, with pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP contributing to his respiratory failure. He has been treated with antibiotics and has a tracheostomy in place.

Lab Results:

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 26.6 g/dL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 28.6%
* Platelet count (Plt): 183 K/uL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.5 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 17 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: normal
* Coagulation studies: normal

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is multifactorial, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB, and his Hct has dropped to 28.6%. He may require further evaluation and treatment for the source of bleeding.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a PE, and he may require continued anticoagulation therapy.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and a previous cardiac arrest. He may require continued monitoring for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and congestive heart failure.
5. Metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to metabolic encephalopathy, and he may require continued monitoring and treatment for this condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to support the patient's respiratory status.
2. Evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further treatment, including endoscopy or surgery.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy for the patient's PE.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further treatment, including medication or cardioversion.
5. Continue monitoring the patient's mental status and consider further treatment, including medication or therapy, for metabolic encephalopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/60 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with a ventilator, with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate level. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 2.7 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of hypertension, and their blood pressure is being managed with antihypertensive medications. The patient also has a history of diabetes, and their blood glucose level is being monitored and managed.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent episode of sepsis, which was treated with antibiotics. The patient's current medications include insulin, furosemide, and propofol.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, with bilateral wheezing and rhonchi. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities show evidence of edema, with a 2+ edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's neurological status is impaired, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8. The patient is unresponsive to verbal commands and has no movement or tone.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure, which may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or seizures.
5. Infection-related complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).
6. Fluid overload, which may lead to cardiac failure or respiratory distress.
7. Electrolyte imbalances, which may require correction with intravenous fluids and medications.
8. Worsening of the patient's underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and potential medical complications may arise. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to ensure prompt recognition and management of any complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. He was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of persistent respiratory failure, GI bleed, and uncertain mental status. The patient has undergone various interventions, including tracheostomy, antibiotic treatment, and cardiovascular medications.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 62 bpm (58-73)
* Blood pressure: 93/48 mmHg (65-152/87-100)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 10.5 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 199 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mEq/L
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires continued close monitoring and management. The plan includes:

1. Continued treatment for depressed mental status, including minimizing sedation and consulting with the neurology team.
2. Management of respiratory failure, including tracheostomy, empiric antibiotic treatment, and cautious diuresis.
3. Monitoring and management of GI bleed, including GI follow-up, serial hemoglobin checks, and planning for eventual lower endoscopy.
4. Management of CAD/CHF/AFIB, including ongoing sotalol and heparin therapy, and holding ASA and beta-blockers for now.
5. ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further decline in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed may worsen, leading to hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's CAD/CHF/AFIB may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or ischemia.
4. Neurological decline: The patient's depressed mental status may worsen, leading to further neurological decline and potential loss of brainstem function.
5. Infection: The patient's VAP and Enterobacter VAP may lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. He has been in the ICU for several days, experiencing a range of complications, including aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia, persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 100% FiO2. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 550 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of ongoing inflammation, with elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with a alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 28 mg/dL and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 17 mg/dL.

The patient's neurologic status is uncertain, with a depressed mental status and unclear extent of cerebral function. He is currently receiving fosphenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, but the plan is to minimize sedation and potentially discontinue it.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the plan is to continue empiric antibiotics and cautious diuresis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and the plan is to continue serial hematocrit monitoring and consider lower endoscopy.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD and LV aneurysm makes him at risk for cardiovascular instability, particularly with the use of anticoagulants and beta-blockers.
4. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's uncertain mental status and potential for seizure activity make him at risk for neurologic deterioration.
5. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and ventilator-associated pneumonia makes him at risk for ongoing infection.
6. Cardiovascular events: The patient's history of CAD and LV aneurysm makes him at risk for cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's ongoing use of anticoagulants and beta-blockers makes him at risk for hemodynamic instability.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and ongoing use of nephrotoxic medications makes him at risk for renal dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple active issues, including:

1. Depressed mental status: The patient's mental status is uncertain, and the neuro evaluation suggests brainstem function is intact but the extent of cerebral function is unknown. The plan is to minimize sedation, discuss EEG interpretation with neurology, and consider discontinuing fosphenytoin.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD. The plan includes tracheostomy, empiric antibiotics, cautious diuresis, and anticoagulation with heparin.
3. GI bleed: The patient has had a GI bleed, and the plan is to follow serial Hct levels, aiming for a goal Hct of 25. PPI is being held, and ASA is being held for now.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and AFIB. He is on sotalol and heparin, and ASA and BB are being held.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or PE
* GI bleeding due to continued bleeding or complications from the lower scope
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to sotalol and heparin therapy
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation with heparin
* Increased risk of sepsis due to persistent respiratory failure and GI bleed
* Potential for further deterioration in mental status due to ongoing sedation and uncertainty in cerebral function.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a tracheostomy, PEG insertion, and ongoing respiratory failure. They have a history of hypertension, diarrhea, and allergies to Vioxx and Protonix. The patient received antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin, and is currently receiving Heparin sodium and Furosemide. They are on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and are being monitored for respiratory and cardiovascular stability.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg. Their oxygen saturation is 97%, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen through the tracheostomy tube.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a range of 10.5-13.7 K/uL, and a normal hemoglobin level. Their platelet count is 192 K/uL, and their creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. They are at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and are receiving prophylactic measures to prevent these complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further decline in oxygen saturation and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk of developing VAP is high due to their prolonged ventilation and respiratory failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's risk of developing DVT is high due to their prolonged immobility and use of anticoagulation therapy.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding can worsen, leading to further bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and they are at risk for developing hypotension due to their ongoing fluid management and vasopressor therapy.
6. Infection: The patient's risk of developing infection is high due to their prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive devices.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated, and they are at risk for developing metabolic acidosis due to their ongoing metabolic stress and use of vasopressor therapy.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is normal, but they are at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias due to their ongoing vasopressor therapy and electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy,
   although some delta waves.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - Neuro plans to keep phenytoin given concern for seizure despite EEG
   - check phenytoin level daily
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach/PEG, now with multifactorial respiratory
   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -goal even to -500cc
   - IP recs- no trach changes for 10 days, if need for intubation need to
   intubate from above for the nex 10 days
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -GI recs- no plans for inpatient scope. Plan for outpatient workup if
   stable
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   - holding aspirin
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy,
   although some delta waves.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - Neuro plans to keep phenytoin given concern for seizure despite EEG
   - check phenytoin level daily
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach/PEG, now with multifactorial respiratory
   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -goal even to -500cc
   - IP recs- no trach changes for 10 days, if need for intubation need to
   intubate from above for the nex 10 days
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -GI recs- no plans for inpatient scope. Plan for outpatient workup if
   stable
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   - holding aspirin
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiac arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent motor vehicle accident (MVC). He has undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation, and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy for a left ventricular (LV) thrombus.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and is currently receiving treatment for a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB).
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to metabolic encephalopathy, and is receiving anticonvulsant therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to his underlying COPD, pulmonary embolism, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation, combined with his current LV thrombus, puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding, combined with his current LGIB, puts him at risk for further bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia/HAP and his current respiratory failure puts him at risk for further infection.
* Sedation-related complications: The patient's prolonged sedation may lead to respiratory depression, hypotension, and other complications.
* Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can be a complication of prolonged ICU stay, sedation, and underlying medical conditions.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube
* Anticoagulation therapy for LV thrombus
* Treatment for LGIB
* Monitoring for respiratory failure, cardiac complications, and gastrointestinal bleeding
* Sedation management to minimize complications
* Anticonvulsant therapy to manage altered mental status
* Monitoring for infection and delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - In light of no seizure activity, would discontinue Fosphenytoin,
   confirm with neuro
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Check phenytoin this AM
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach, now with multifactorial respiratory failure,
   including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration pneumonia/HAP.  He
   has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum culture growing
   Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to Zosyn after repeat
   CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which improved his WBC; he
   was to complete a 10 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -Cont Vanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -Cautious diuresis goal -500cc
   -Will plan for Trach/PEG tomorrow by IP
   #Hypotension- Resolved, [**Last Name (un) 11349**] was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   -Resumed heparin given PE/LV thrombus
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   - recheck Hct q12
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -Once trach/peg; discuss w/GI to consider work up for bleed, not urgent
   currently
   -Pt has CVL in place
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Resumed heparin gtt yesterday given hct stable
   -LENI
s done overnight-no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   -Hold heparin MN for trach tomorrow
   .
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb
   -Continue Sotalol per home regimen (d/w EP and okay to use in ischemic
   heart dz)
   - TTE as above showed EF 45%, anterior akinesis
   -Holding aspirin
   -Holding BB in setting of GIB/Hypotension
   #Borderline DM- Per OSH pt required 40U Lantus with ISS- here only
   using sliding scale given NPO and FS in good control
   -Continue above regimen for now ([**11-22**] when NPO)
   .

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to multiple comorbidities and complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, chronic, with multifactorial etiology including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
* Altered mental status, likely due to metabolic encephalopathy, with no evidence of anoxic brain injury
* Gastrointestinal bleed, lower, with presumed LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding)
* Hypotension, resolved, with possible causes including infection, sedation, and gastrointestinal bleed
* Left ventricular thrombus/PE (pulmonary embolism) with anti-coagulation required
* History of CAD, with sotalol prescribed for atrial fibrillation (AFib)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening respiratory function, need for mechanical ventilation, or development of respiratory distress syndrome
* Gastrointestinal bleed: further bleeding, need for blood transfusions, or development of gastrointestinal perforation
* Hypotension: recurrent hypotension, need for vasopressors, or development of shock
* Left ventricular thrombus/PE: worsening of cardiac function, development of cardiac arrhythmias, or need for cardiac surgery
* Infection: development of sepsis, need for broad-spectrum antibiotics, or progression to organ failure
* Neurological complications: worsening of altered mental status, development of seizures, or need for neurosurgical intervention

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue antiepileptic medication for altered mental status
* Sputum culture and antibiotic therapy for HAP
* Cautious diuresis to improve respiratory status
* Heparin gtt for PE/LV thrombus
* Blood transfusions for Hct < 25
* Monitoring of sedation and mental status
* Plan for tracheostomy and PEG insertion
* Holding anti-HTNs and aspirin due to gastrointestinal bleed
* Holding beta blockers due to hypotension
* Continuing H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, with a notable course marked by aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute.
* Respiratory support: the patient is receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) through a tracheostomy tube, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: the patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg and a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) in place.
* Fluid balance: the patient has received a total of 1,279 mL of fluids and has lost 2,868 mL of fluids through various routes.
* Laboratory results: the patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 10.5-13.7 x 10^9/L, with a platelet count of 199-192 x 10^9/L. His serum creatinine (Cr) is 0.6-0.6 mg/dL, and his troponin-T is <0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's active issues include:

1. Depressed mental status: the patient has a depressed mental status, with uncertain cerebral function. The EEG shows possible subclinical seizure activity, and the patient is receiving anticonvulsant therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: the patient has persistent respiratory failure, with possible causes including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
3. GI bleed: the patient has had a gastrointestinal bleed, with stable hemoglobin (Hct) levels. The patient is being followed closely for signs of bleeding recurrence.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB: the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He is receiving anticoagulant therapy and has had an echocardiogram without evidence of left ventricular thrombus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: the patient's history of aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and VAP increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: the patient's persistent respiratory failure increases his risk of developing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding increases his risk of bleeding recurrence, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac complications: the patient's history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation increases his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
5. Neurological complications: the patient's depressed mental status and possible subclinical seizure activity increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple active issues and potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. The patient has had a prolonged ICU course, with notable events including aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia, persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: Persistent respiratory failure, with causes including pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Cardiovascular: Coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and atrial fibrillation.
* Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal bleeding, with a stable hemoglobin level.
* Neurological: Depressed mental status, with brainstem function intact but uncertain extent of cerebral function.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, possible need for tracheostomy, and risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmias, possible cardiac tamponade, and risk of cardiogenic shock.
* Gastrointestinal: Further bleeding, possible need for endoscopy or surgery, and risk of sepsis.
* Neurological: Possible worsening of depressed mental status, risk of seizures, and possible need for further neurological evaluation.
* Infectious: Risk of sepsis, possible need for further antibiotic treatment, and risk of multi-drug resistant organisms.
* Hematological: Possible need for blood transfusions, risk of bleeding, and possible need for further coagulation testing.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for his conditions, including antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and diuretics. Further evaluation and management are needed to address the patient's ongoing medical issues and prevent potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old man with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. He has been in the ICU for several days with multiple active issues, including persistent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and uncertain mental status. The patient is currently on several medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and anti-arrhythmic agents. He has had multiple episodes of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 110/79 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 38 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: central venous pressure (CVP) 11 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) not recorded

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: moving head and arms spontaneously, but no tracking or purposeful responses
* Cardiovascular: regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallop
* Pulmonary: clear to auscultation
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender
* Extremities: 1+ edema throughout
* Neurological: no purposeful responses to voice, spontaneous movements as above

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.5-13.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.0-10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 183-192 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15-30 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: potassium 3.4-4.5 mmol/L, sodium 135-145 mmol/L, chloride 98-110 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: persistent and may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: may require further evaluation and treatment, including endoscopy and blood transfusions.
* Uncertain mental status: may require further evaluation and treatment, including neuroimaging and neuropsychological testing.
* Cardiac complications: may require further evaluation and treatment, including echocardiography and anti-arrhythmic medications.
* Infection: may require further evaluation and treatment, including antibiotics and wound care.
* Fluid overload: may require further evaluation and treatment, including diuretics and fluid restriction.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. He has been in the ICU for several days with a prolonged course of respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and sepsis. He has been treated with antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and respiratory support. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/79 mmHg.

The patient has been experiencing persistent sinus tachycardia, and his mental status is depressed, with no purposeful response to voice. His respiratory status is stable, but he continues to require mechanical ventilation. His gastrointestinal bleeding has stabilized, and his hemoglobin level is stable.

The patient has been treated with multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and pain medication. He has also been given prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he continues to require mechanical ventilation. He may be at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has stabilized, but he may be at risk for further bleeding or perforation.
3. Sepsis: The patient has had a prolonged course of sepsis, and he may be at risk for further septic complications, such as organ failure or death.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and left ventricular aneurysm, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's mental status is depressed, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema.
6. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but he may be at risk for further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and prolonged ICU stay make him at risk for a variety of medical complications. It is essential to continue to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop and presumed
   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy,
   although some delta waves.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - Neuro plans to keep phenytoin given concern for seizure despite EEG
   - check phenytoin level daily
   - f/u neuro recs
   - monitor sedation and lighten if possible to monitor mental status
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach/PEG, now with multifactorial respiratory
   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily
   -Continue heparin gtt for PE, no LE DVT so no IVC filter
   -goal even to -500cc
   - IP recs- no trach changes for 10 days, if need for intubation need to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   LGIB.
   #. Mental Status: No evidence of anoxic brain injury, likely metabolic
   encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis
   - EEG no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy,
   although some delta waves.
   - MRI without evidence of anoxic brain injury
   - Neuro plans to keep phenytoin given concern for seizure despite EEG
   - check phenytoin level daily

   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn today is day  14 of 14 day course for VAP;
   -CXR daily

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

1. The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. The patient has a prolonged history of intubation, which has led to a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels and presumed lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).
3. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including cefepime and Zosyn, for aspiration pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection.
4. The patient has a pulmonary embolism (PE) and left ventricular thrombus (LV thrombus), requiring anticoagulation therapy.
5. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation, and is currently taking sotalol per home regimen.
6. The patient has borderline diabetes, managed with sliding scale insulin.
7. The patient has a central venous catheter (CVL) in place for medication administration and blood draws.
8. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and is planned to be transferred to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require endoscopy or surgery to identify and treat the source.
3. Pulmonary embolism, which may require further anticoagulation therapy or thrombolysis.
4. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to the patient's history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation.
5. Infection, including sepsis, which may require broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Hemodynamic instability, potentially requiring vasopressor therapy or blood transfusions.
7. Neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy, due to the patient's altered mental status.
8. Malnutrition or dehydration, potentially requiring enteral nutrition or fluid resuscitation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   72 year old male with h/o CAD & COPD presents after MVC complicated by
   post-op PE requiring prolonged intubation with Hct drop, MS changes
   concerning for seizure and VAP now s/p treatment
   #. Mental Status: Patient had altered MS since events at OSH; neurology
   consulted here, MRI and EEG performed
 No evidence of anoxic brain
   injury, likely metabolic encephalopathy. Unclear as to prognosis. EEG
   no seizure activity and slowing suggestive of encephalopathy, although
   some delta waves.
   - Continue phenytoin per neuro
   - check phenytoin level daily
   - f/u neuro recs
   # Respiratory: S/P Trach/PEG, now with multifactorial respiratory
   failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD and aspiration
   pneumonia/HAP.  He has been treated with Cefepime based on a sputum
   culture growing Enterobacter aerogenes; then his abx were changed to
   Zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate which
   improved his WBC; he was to complete a 14 day course of abx.
   - sputum culture from [**12-9**] with enterobacter (resistant to ampicillin,
   some cephalosporins)
   -completedVanc/Zosyn 14 day course
   -CXR daily
   -Changed to Lovenox; will need to begin coumadin once bleeding issue
   stable
   -goal even to -500cc- give add
l lasix today
   - IP recs- no trach changes for 10 days, if need for intubation need to
   intubate from above for the next 10 days
   #Hypotension- Resolved, likely was [**12-23**] to infection (elevated WBC, Left
   sided pna on CXR) vs sedation vs GIB. Cortisol random was 22.  Required
   vasopressin and then levophed, howver now off
   -F/U Culture data
   -Cautiously diuresing as above to improve respiratory status; if BP
   drops will give back fluids
   #LGIB-Pt noted to have bright red blood at rehab while on heparin gtt;
   gtt has been stopped. He was evaluated at OSH and noted to have 7pt Hct
   drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, pt had EGD at OSH and not able
   to visualize anything (? no source of UGIB). Differential diagnosis
   includes diverticulosis vs AVM vs maligancy, however now Hct stable
   since admission
   - will transfuse for Hct > 25,
   -Holding anti-HTNs
   -GI recs- no plans for inpatient scope. Plan for outpatient workup if
   stable
   .
   #LV Thrombus/PE- Patient had echo which showed LV thrombus requiring
   anti-coagulation, also with PE post op
   -Heparin held [**12-23**] hematuria; start Lovenox today
   -LENI
s no evidence of DVT
   -ECHO showed 40-45% EF / apical and anterior akinesis
   #H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**] and a.fibb

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and a recent history of cardiac arrest. He has undergone multiple interventions, including prolonged intubation, pulmonary embolism, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including pulmonary embolism, COPD, and aspiration pneumonia/HAP. He has been treated with antibiotics and is currently on a ventilator.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a left ventricular thrombus, which has been treated with anticoagulation. He also has a history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, which has been stabilized. He has undergone an endoscopy and has been treated with anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, which is likely due to metabolic encephalopathy. He has been treated with phenytoin and has undergone imaging studies, including MRI and EEG.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's left ventricular thrombus and history of cardiac arrest put him at risk for further cardiovascular events.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant risk factor for further bleeding and potential complications.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status is a risk factor for further neurological decline and potential complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Cardiovascular support: The patient will continue to receive anticoagulation therapy and will be monitored for further cardiovascular events.
* Gastrointestinal support: The patient will continue to receive anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, and will be monitored for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Neurological support: The patient will continue to receive phenytoin and will be monitored for further neurological decline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including:

1. Depressed mental status: The patient's mental status is depressed, and his brainstem function is intact, but the extent of his cerebral function is uncertain. The EEG showed possible subclinical seizure activity, and the patient is currently receiving anticonvulsant therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which is caused by pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off sedating medications.
3. GI bleed: The patient has had a GI bleed, and his Hct is stable. He is being monitored closely for further bleeding, and a lower scope is planned for eventual evaluation.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and AFIB. He is on sotalol and lovenox for anticoagulation, and ASA is being held for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG showed possible subclinical seizure activity, and he is currently receiving anticonvulsant therapy. If the seizure activity is not controlled, it can lead to further complications, such as status epilepticus.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is persistent, and if not managed properly, it can lead to further complications, such as respiratory arrest.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and if not managed properly, it can lead to further complications, such as anemia, bleeding into the abdominal cavity, or even death.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD, CHF, and AFIB puts him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient has had a recent ICU course and has been exposed to various antibiotics. He is at risk for developing an infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's depressed mental status and possible subclinical seizure activity put him at risk for further neurological complications, such as cognitive decline, seizure activity, or even coma.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications to prevent further complications and ensure his optimal recovery."

   activity seen) as well as any other recs
   - minimize sedation --> talk to Neuro about dc/ing fosphenytoin
   - will turn off propofol and re-examine daily.  Propofol now off, and
   he is mildly agitated/moving spontaneously, but no purposeful
   responses. Does not track
   -MRI not suggestive of anoxic injury
   -hold all sedating meds, but will restart pain medication if he appears
   uncomfortable
   (2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE- persistent; causes include pneumonia, poss
   pulm edema, PE, COPD
   -trach/PEG yesterday
   -Abx d/c yesterday after 14 day course
   -?some fluid overload.  Has been negative without diuretics
   -cautious anticoag w/ heparin gtt for PE
   -COPD appears stable clinically; scheduled nebs
   -try decreasing PS to [**8-24**] today
   (3) GI BLEED- Hct stable
   -GI following, planning for eventual lower scope
   -follow serial hct, goal hct 25
   -ppi [**Hospital1 **], holding ASA
   (5) CAD/CHF/ AFIB-
   -on sotalol and heparin gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   72 yo w/ CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic
   surgery- course notable for asp pna, PE, Enterobatcer VAP, persistent
   resp failure, GI bleed. Transferred for further evaluation- additional
   active issues include persistent SVT, uncertain mental status.
   (1) DEPRESSED MENTAL STATUS- per neuro eval, brainstem fxn intact but
   extent of cerebral fxn uncertain.
   - touch base w/ neuro re: continued tx given EEG interpretation (no sz
   activity seen) as well as any other recs
   - minimize sedation --> talk to Neuro about dc/ing fosphenytoin
   - will turn off propofol and re-examine daily.  Propofol now off, and
   he is mildly agitated/moving spontaneously, but no purposeful
   responses. Does not track
   -MRI not suggestive of anoxic injury
   -hold all sedating meds, but will restart pain medication if he appears
   uncomfortable
   (2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE- persistent; causes include pneumonia, poss
   pulm edema, PE, COPD
   -trach/PEG yesterday
   -Abx d/c yesterday after 14 day course
   -?some fluid overload.  Has been negative without diuretics
   -cautious anticoag w/ heparin gtt for PE
   -COPD appears stable clinically; scheduled nebs
   -try decreasing PS to [**8-24**] today
   (3) GI BLEED- Hct stable
   -GI following, planning for eventual lower scope

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical issues, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure, which is likely caused by pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. Depressed mental status: The patient has a depressed mental status, with uncertain cerebral function. The EEG showed possible subclinical seizure activity, and the patient was started on dilantin. The plan is to minimize sedation, turn off propofol, and re-examine daily.
3. GI bleed: The patient has a GI bleed, with a stable Hct. The plan is to follow serial Hct, goal Hct 25, and plan for eventual lower scope.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient has CAD, chronic heart failure (CHF), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). He is on sotalol and heparin gtt, and ASA is held for now.
5. ID: The patient has a low-grade temperature and a trending-up WBC count.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD can lead to respiratory failure, which can worsen the patient's condition.
2. Depressed mental status: The patient's depressed mental status can lead to further complications, such as decreased cognitive function, increased risk of falls, and decreased ability to communicate effectively.
3. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed can lead to further complications, such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, and increased risk of bleeding.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient's CAD, CHF, and AFIB can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of cardiac events.
5. ID: The patient's ID can lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, and increased risk of mortality.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and receive appropriate treatment, including antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulation therapy for PE, and management of COPD. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and sedation should be minimized. The patient's GI bleed should be managed with serial Hct monitoring and goal Hct 25. The patient's CAD, CHF, and AFIB should be managed with medications and close monitoring. Finally, the patient's ID should be managed with antibiotics and close monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period, with a notable course marked by aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, enterobacter VAP, persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.8°C, heart rate is 86 bpm, blood pressure is 152/87 mmHg, and respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving isotropic support and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 cmH2O.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,020 mL of fluid, with 1,623 mL being IV fluid and 397 mL being enteral nutrition.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is uncertain due to the presence of possible subclinical seizure activity, and he is receiving anticonvulsant therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and enterobacter VAP, which increases the risk of developing sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status is complex, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is uncertain, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the plan is to continue ICU care, with a focus on managing the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status, as well as preventing further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and recent orthopedic surgery. He has been in the ICU for several days, with a notable course marked by aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia, persistent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Persistent respiratory failure, with a tracheostomy tube in place, and ventilator settings of CMV/AutoFlow with a Vt of 550 mL, PS of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and atrial fibrillation, and is currently on sotalol and heparin gtt.
* Neurological status: The patient has a depressed mental status, with brainstem function intact but extent of cerebral function uncertain. He is currently off propofol and is mildly agitated, but does not respond to stimuli.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, with a stable Hct level. He is currently receiving PPI and holding ASA.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low-grade fever today, and if he spikes, a pan-culture will be performed. His UA is currently being checked.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued respiratory failure, potentially leading to further lung damage or respiratory arrest
* Pneumonia or other pulmonary complications, potentially leading to sepsis or multi-organ failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, potentially leading to hemorrhagic shock or sepsis
* Cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure, potentially leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock
* Neurological deterioration, potentially leading to brain death or persistent vegetative state
* Sepsis or multi-organ failure, potentially leading to mortality

The patient's current plan of care includes:

* Minimizing sedation and restarting pain medication as needed
* Cautious anticoagulation with heparin gtt for PE
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and adjusting ventilator settings as needed
* Following serial Hct levels and planning for eventual lower scope
* Holding ASA and restarting it as needed
* Continuing PPI and monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure and adjusting treatment as needed
* Monitoring for signs of neurological deterioration and adjusting treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo w/ CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic
   surgery- course notable for asp pna, PE, Enterobatcer VAP, persistent
   resp failure, GI bleed. Transferred for further evaluation- additional
   active issues include persistent SVT, uncertain mental status.
   (1) DEPRESSED MENTAL STATUS- per neuro eval, brainstem fxn intact but
   extent of cerebral fxn uncertain.
   - touch base w/ neuro re: continued tx given EEG interpretation (no sz
   activity seen) as well as any other recs
   - minimize sedation --> talk to Neuro about dc/ing fosphenytoin
   - will turn off propofol and re-examine daily.  Propofol now off, and
   he is mildly agitated/moving spontaneously, but no purposeful
   responses. Does not track
   -MRI not suggestive of anoxic injury
   -hold all sedating meds, but fentanyl patch started for pain
   (2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE- persistent; causes include pneumonia, poss
   pulm edema, PE, COPD
   -trach/PEG yesterday
   -Abx d/c yesterday after 14 day course
   -?some fluid overload.  Has been negative without diuretics
   -cautious anticoag w/ heparin gtt for PE. Will change to lovenox now
   that hematuria cleared.
   -COPD appears stable clinically; scheduled nebs
   -back on AC due to apnea.
   (3) GI BLEED- Hct stable
   -GI following, planning for eventual lower scope
   -follow serial hct, goal hct 25
   -ppi [**Hospital1 **], holding ASA
   -monitor closely while on lovenox for PE
   (5) CAD/CHF/ AFIB-
   -on sotalol
   -lovenox for anticoagulation
   -ASA held for now
   -echo reviewed without LV thrombus
   -CXR looks like more edema, and has more LE edema as well. Lasix for
   goal negative 1L today
   (6) ID: low grade temp again today, and WBC count trending up.
   Recently finished 14 day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP.
   No additional antibiotics for now, but should be monitored closely, and
   cultured if he spikes.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including CAD, LV aneurysm, and recent ICU course following orthopedic surgery. He has been experiencing various complications, including:

* Respiratory failure, which is persistent and likely caused by pneumonia, possible pulmonary edema, PE, and COPD
* Depressed mental status, with uncertain cerebral function and possible anoxic injury
* GI bleed, which has stabilized, but is still being monitored closely
* CAD/CHF/AFIB, with ongoing anticoagulation and cardiac medications
* ID, with a low-grade temperature and trending up WBC count, which requires close monitoring

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulation, and cardiac medications. He has also had several procedures, including tracheostomy and placement of a PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and may worsen if not properly managed. This could lead to further complications, such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest.
2. Depressed mental status: The patient's depressed mental status is a concern, as it may indicate a lack of cerebral function or anoxic injury. This could lead to further complications, such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and decreased quality of life.
3. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is still a concern, as it may recur or worsen if not properly managed. This could lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased quality of life.
4. CAD/CHF/AFIB: The patient's CAD/CHF/AFIB is a significant concern, as it may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and decreased quality of life.
5. ID: The patient's ID is a concern, as it may lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, and decreased quality of life.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his quality of life."
