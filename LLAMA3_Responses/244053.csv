   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Shock: Hypovolemic vs Septic shock given history of profuse diarrhea
   and grossly positive UA. Pressure not responsive to fluids arguing
   against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. Also s/p 2U PRBCs in
   ED. Afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC arguing against sepsis but
   she is on max dose levophed with MAPS of 55-60. [**Month (only) 8**] be obstructive (ie
   PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Treat with empiric antibiotics
   - Place A-line
   - Ck SV02 and consider PRBCs if less than 70
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**]. Now with
   ARF in setting of hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN.
   - Ck urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Acute renal failure: Prerenal vs ATN
* Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue boluses with goal CVP 12
* Continue levophed for MAP >60
* Treat with empiric antibiotics
* Place A-line
* Check SV02 and consider PRBCs if less than 70
* ECHO in AM to R/O PE
* Send stool cx, o and p, c diff
* Start PO flagyl
* No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
* Monitor fever curve and WBC count
* Continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
* Ck urine lytes
* Monitor BUN/CR and lytes
* Maintain MAP >60
* IVFs with bicarb
* Recheck lactate
* Monitor chem panel

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Sepsis
* Urosepsis
* C. difficile colitis
* Radiation colitis
* Acute tubular necrosis
* Anion gap acidosis
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hyperphosphatemia

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to prevent these potential complications and optimize her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical condition. Here is a summary of the patient's current status:

* Vital signs: Bradycardia (53 bpm), hypotension (94/43 mmHg), and tachypnea (11 inspirations per minute).
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 19 mmHg, indicating volume overload.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,944 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 80 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has a partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 75%.
* Cardiovascular system: The patient has a sinus bradycardia and is receiving norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions to support blood pressure.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Blood work: The patient has a white blood cell count of 35.1, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 195.
	+ Electrolytes: The patient has a potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L, sodium level of 121 mg/dL, and chloride level of 104 mEq/L.
	+ Renal function: The patient has a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36.0 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a large presacral pelvic mass eroding the sacrum, but no free air or fluid in the abdomen.
* Allergies: The patient is allergic to Zocor (simvastatin) and Flagyl (metronidazole).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current status include:

* Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal electrolyte levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) may indicate respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN level suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile and elevated platelet count may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
* Tumor-related complications: The patient's large presacral pelvic mass may compress or invade surrounding organs, leading to complications such as bowel obstruction or bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been receiving empiric antibiotics, vasopressors, and IV fluids, and has shown some improvement in her blood pressure and heart rate. However, she remains bradycardic and hypotensive, and has developed anion gap acidosis and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's history of diarrhea and grossly positive urine culture, there is a high risk of septic shock, which could worsen her condition.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk of developing ARDS due to her underlying lung cancer and the use of vasopressors.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension could be indicative of cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and acute worsening of chronic diarrhea could lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and potentially life-threatening conditions like Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen her condition, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening conditions like uremic syndrome.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's chronic leukocytosis and elevated white blood cell count could indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition if not properly treated.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely, and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here

   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse

   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN. Urine lytes support this diagnosis.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 53 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/43 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 75%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient has a large presacral pelvic mass eroding the sacrum, which is likely to be a metastatic lesion from her cervical cancer. The mass is not causing any obstruction or free air in the abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 35.1-36.0 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 30.3-32%
* Platelet count: 195-167 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.1-3.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 6.9 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is likely to be hypovolemic shock due to diarrhea and acute renal failure, possibly complicated by sepsis. The patient's response to glucagon suggests that her hypotension and bradycardia may be partly due to atenolol, but this is not the complete picture.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue IV fluids with goal CVP of 12
* Continue levophed for MAP >60
* Continue empiric antibiotics, at least until C. difficile testing is available
* Transfuse as needed
* ECHO in the morning to rule out pulmonary embolism
* Monitor fever curve and white blood cell count
* Continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
* Monitor BUN and creatinine levels
* Maintain MAP >60
* IV fluids with bicarbonate to correct anion gap acidosis
* Recheck lactate levels
* Monitor chem panel

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's diarrhea and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalance and acidosis.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and IV fluids may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
* Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as respiratory acidosis and cardiac arrhythmias.
* C. difficile infection: The patient's diarrhea and history of C. difficile infection may lead to further complications such as sepsis and organ failure if not managed properly.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of cervical cancer and metastatic lesions may increase her risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be a life-threatening complication if not managed properly."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 53 bpm (bradycardic)
* Blood pressure: 94/43 mmHg (hypotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 11 inspirations per minute (normal)
* Oxygen saturation: 75% (supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula)
* Bradycardia and hypotension persist despite maximum doses of norepinephrine and phenylephrine, with some improvement in pressures after glucagon administration.

The patient has a large presacral pelvic mass eroding the sacrum, which is likely to be the cause of her symptoms. She has a history of C. difficile infection and is allergic to flagyl, which may be contributing to her diarrhea. The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to infection or malignancy, and her acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in etiology.

The patient's anion gap acidosis is likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure, and her hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon administration.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's rising WBC count, hypotension, and bradycardia, septic shock is a possible complication.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation suggest cardiogenic shock as a possible complication.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure and pre-renal etiology may lead to ATN.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's diarrhea and saline administration may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and UTI/urosepsis may lead to infection.
6. Malignancy progression: The patient's known sacral metastases and worsening diarrhea may indicate progression of her malignancy.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory acidosis may lead to respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may lead to cardiovascular collapse.

The patient's treatment plan should focus on addressing these potential complications, including managing her shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure, as well as monitoring her electrolyte imbalances and infection risk."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN. Urine lytes support this diagnosis.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, currently in the ICU due to shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and glucagon, with some improvement in her hemodynamic status. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate, as well as anion gap acidosis. She has also been diagnosed with acute worsening of chronic diarrhea, which may be secondary to C. difficile infection or radiation colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of profuse diarrhea and grossly positive urine analysis, it is possible that she may be septic, which could lead to further deterioration in her condition.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.5-2, and she has developed AKI, which could worsen her overall condition.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her underlying lung cancer and metastatic disease.
4. C. difficile Infection (CDI): The patient's diarrhea may be secondary to CDI, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
5. Radiation Colitis: The patient's recent radiation therapy may have caused radiation colitis, which could lead to further complications, including bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to various factors, including sepsis, AKI, or vasopressor therapy, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
7. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may be secondary to elevated lactate levels, which could worsen her overall condition if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone to cover for possible C. difficile infection.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine levels to assess the severity of AKI.
3. Consider performing a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out any underlying bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Monitor the patient's lactate levels and consider administering bicarbonate therapy to manage anion gap acidosis.
5. Continue vasopressor therapy to maintain the patient's blood pressure.
6. Consider performing an echocardiogram to rule out any underlying cardiac disease.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely to assess for any signs of respiratory failure."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been receiving pressors to maintain blood pressure and has a history of antibiotic use. The patient's condition has been stable, with some improvement in mentation and a decrease in pressor requirements. However, she still requires respiratory support and has ongoing fluid management issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of sepsis is likely due to the presence of shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. This condition can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and increased mortality if not managed promptly.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's echocardiogram revealed moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, which can lead to right-sided heart failure and increased pulmonary artery pressure. This condition can further exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac status.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infection.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a low SpO2 level and requirement for oxygen therapy. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections can further deteriorate her respiratory function.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea may indicate an underlying gastrointestinal infection or inflammatory process, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of sepsis.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other underlying conditions, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and PTT values may indicate a coagulopathy, which can increase her risk of bleeding complications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and ongoing management issues, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her care plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   CT scan without contrast
   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
    - onc recs
   - CT repeat as above
   .
   Diabetes:
   - FS QID
   - ISS

   HTN: holding meds while on pressors

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CT scan without contrast
   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
    - onc recs
   - CT repeat as above
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact

   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, currently presenting with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications can arise. The most immediate concern is the patient's hypotension, which may be due to septic shock, hypovolemic shock, or cardiogenic shock. The patient's blood pressure is not responsive to IV fluids, and she is requiring vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60.

The patient's acute renal failure is also a concern, with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.0 and a current creatinine of 4.2. The patient's urine lytes and FeNa suggest a pre-renal etiology, likely due to fluid losses. The patient's anion gap acidosis is likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure, and may also be contributing to her metabolic acidosis.

The patient's diarrhea is a concern, with a history of C. diff and a recent course of antibiotics. The patient is also allergic to Flagyl, which may be contributing to her diarrhea. The patient's leukocytosis is also a concern, with a chronically elevated WBC count and an increase since admission. The patient's CT scan did not show evidence of inflammation or abscess, but the lack of contrast limits the ability to evaluate.

The patient's condition is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and management. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock or sepsis
* Cardiogenic shock
* Hypovolemic shock
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Anion gap acidosis
* Metabolic acidosis
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
* Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Intestinal obstruction
* Sepsis-induced coagulopathy
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

The patient's care plan should include:

* Close monitoring of her vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation
* Management of her hypotension with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation
* Treatment of her acute renal failure with IV fluids and medications as needed
* Management of her anion gap acidosis with IV bicarbonate and other medications as needed
* Treatment of her diarrhea with antibiotics and other medications as needed
* Management of her leukocytosis with antibiotics and other medications as needed
* Close monitoring of her electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and chloride
* Management of her hyperglycemia with insulin and other medications as needed
* Close monitoring of her respiratory status, including oxygen saturation and lung sounds
* Management of her gastrointestinal status, including nausea and vomiting
* Close monitoring of her cardiovascular status, including blood pressure and heart rate
* Management of her hemodynamic status, including cardiac output and peripheral resistance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, is currently in the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She is on two pressors, norepinephrine and phenylephrine, and has a tracheostomy. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/38 mmHg. She has a SpO2 of 87% and is on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 35.1, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 195. Her creatinine is 4.1 mg/dL, and her troponin-T is 0.05 ng/mL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show a large presacral soft tissue mass with destruction of the left sacrum, consistent with metastatic disease. There is also an interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diarrhea and cloudy urine specimen suggest a possible septicemia, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressure and tricuspid regurgitation may indicate cardiac dysfunction, which could lead to cardiac arrest or heart failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 of 87% and ABG results suggest respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory arrest or chronic respiratory disease.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea may lead to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and malnutrition if not managed properly.
6. Infection: The patient's cloudy urine specimen and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated creatinine may indicate a risk of bleeding or hemorrhagic complications.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli may indicate a risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures."

   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   is likely reason for hyponatremia this morning. This metabolic acidosis
   is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch to IV NS today.
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complex and requires a comprehensive analysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's rising WBC count, hypotension, and hyperventilation suggest sepsis, although the exact cause is unclear.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's dilated right ventricle, hypokinetic right ventricle, and elevated pulmonary artery pressures on the trans-thoracic echo suggest a high risk of PE.
3. Right Heart Infarct: The patient's right ventricular hypokinesis and low voltage EKG suggest the possibility of a right heart infarct.
4. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's repeat FeNa of 2.3% suggests a component of ATN in addition to pre-renal etiology.
5. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to elevated lactate, renal failure, and diarrhea.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon and requires adjustment of SSI.
7. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and fluid losses suggest hypovolemic shock, although the exact cause is unclear.
8. Urosepsis: The patient's UA with >50 WBCs suggests the possibility of UTI/urosepsis.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload on exam suggests the need for careful fluid management.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning phenylephrine off and considering dopamine as an alternative pressor.
2. Containing ceftriaxone and flagyl for now, pending culture results.
3. Ordering a V/Q scan to look for evidence of PE.
4. Considering a right heart EKG to evaluate for right heart ischemia.
5. Sending stool and sputum cultures.
6. Monitoring the patient's fever curve and WBC count.
7. Continuing ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis and considering discontinuing flagyl.
8. Switching to IV NS for fluids and monitoring chem panel.
9. Contacting oncology for recommendations on managing the patient's cervical cancer and NSCLC.
10. Repeating CT scan with imaging if the patient is stable.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is being managed in the ICU with ongoing monitoring and treatment of her multiple medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female admit with hypotension and bradycardia now with findings
   on ECHO to suggest significant impairment in RV function and
   significant increase in pulmonary artery pressures noted (mod PAH and
   TR).  This in in the setting of persistent bradycardia suggesting
   possible RV vascular distribution ischemia.  In addition the elevations
   in pulmonary artery pressure remain to be defined in regards to
   source.  Finally--she retains a significant bandemia in the setting of
   elevated WBC count.
   The source of persistent hypotension seems in large part to be driven
   by cardiac compromise (high BNP, ECHO findings) in the setting of
   persistent bradycardia
perhaps increased RV afterload and difficulty
   with maintenance of effective CO with increased demand in the setting
   of likely systemic infection with possible urinary source as evidenced
   by the elevated WBC count and bandemia.  GI source with diarrhea
   suspected but diarrhea not clearly confirmed.  The current source of
   the elevated PA pressures in the setting of preserved LV function
   remains to be defined.

   Vasodilatory Component-
   -CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff
   -Neosynephrine/Levophed continue and hope to wean
   -Cultures pending

   -Possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as
   well
would like to treat for possible PE and favor treatment if we can
   find reassurance that bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT negative
   for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive
   -Bradycardia persistent, BNP is up, do not see evidence of acute MI on
   findings thus far
mild elevations in enzymes have decreased and may be
   evidence of remote insult or current area at risk
   -Favor change to IV Beta specific agonists for support
with Dopamine
   representing reasonable compromise as with fixed and impaired RV stroke
   volume and peripheral beta effects Dobutamine represents a second
   choice.
   -LV function is preserved
   Hypovolemia-
   -Has been resolved with UVF to the point of likely volume overload
   2)Bradycardia-
   -Telemetry
   -Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors

   of stable enzymes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and bradycardia. She has undergone a transthoracic echo, which revealed significant impairment in RV function, increased pulmonary artery pressures, and moderate/severe TR. The patient has a history of sepsis, and her current condition is likely driven by cardiac compromise, persistent bradycardia, and a possible urinary source of infection. The patient is receiving vasopressors and antibiotics, and her condition is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock:
	* Vasodilatory component: The patient's hypotension may be driven by a vasodilatory component, which could be exacerbated by the administration of vasopressors.
	* Cardiogenic component: The patient's cardiac compromise, including impaired RV function and increased pulmonary artery pressures, may contribute to her hypotension.
2. Bradycardia:
	* The patient's persistent bradycardia may be a sign of ongoing RV vascular distribution ischemia, which could further compromise her cardiac function.
3. Acute Renal Failure:
	* The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest acute kidney injury, which may be related to her hypotension, cardiac compromise, or sepsis.
4. Pulmonary Embolism:
	* The patient's increased pulmonary artery pressures and possible RV vascular distribution ischemia may be indicative of a pulmonary embolism.
5. Sepsis:
	* The patient's sepsis may be driven by a urinary source of infection, and her condition may be complicated by the development of septic shock.
6. Respiratory Failure:
	* The patient's respiratory status is compromised, as evidenced by her need for oxygen therapy and her elevated respiratory rate.
7. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* The patient's cardiac compromise may lead to further complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, cardiac function, and renal function. The patient's sepsis and cardiac compromise require aggressive management, including the administration of antibiotics, vasopressors, and inotropes. The patient's respiratory status requires close monitoring and management, and her nutritional and glycemic control require attention."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female admit with hypotension and bradycardia now with findings
   on ECHO to suggest significant impairment in RV function and
   significant increase in pulmonary artery pressures noted (mod PAH and
   TR).  This in in the setting of persistent bradycardia suggesting
   possible RV vascular distribution ischemia.  In addition the elevations
   in pulmonary artery pressure remain to be defined in regards to
   source.  Finally--she retains a significant bandemia in the setting of
   elevated WBC count.
   The source of persistent hypotension seems in large part to be driven
   by cardiac compromise (high BNP, ECHO findings) in the setting of
   persistent bradycardia
perhaps increased RV afterload and difficulty
   with maintenance of effective CO with increased demand in the setting
   of likely systemic infection with possible urinary source as evidenced
   by the elevated WBC count and bandemia.  GI source with diarrhea
   suspected but diarrhea not clearly confirmed.  The current source of
   the elevated PA pressures in the setting of preserved LV function
   remains to be defined.
   1)Shock-
   Vasodilatory Component-
   -CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff
   -Neosynephrine/Levophed continue and hope to wean
   -Cultures pending
   Cardiogenic Component-
   -Possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as
   well
would like to treat for possible PE and favor treatment if we can
   find reassurance that bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT negative
   for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive
   -Bradycardia persistent, BNP is up, do not see evidence of acute MI on
   findings thus far
mild elevations in enzymes have decreased and may be
   evidence of remote insult or current area at risk
   -Favor change to IV Beta specific agonists for support
with Dopamine
   representing reasonable compromise as with fixed and impaired RV stroke
   volume and peripheral beta effects Dobutamine represents a second
   choice.
   -LV function is preserved
   Hypovolemia-
   -Has been resolved with UVF to the point of likely volume overload
   2)Bradycardia-
   -Telemetry
   -Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors
   -Will look to RV leads to help assure no ongoing insult in the setting
   of stable enzymes
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likley ATN
   -Continue support of BP
   FeNa=low and poor perfusion but now evolving a process consistent with

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted with hypotension and bradycardia. She has a history of sepsis, and her condition has worsened, with persistent bradycardia and significant impairment in right ventricular (RV) function. Her pulmonary artery pressures are elevated, and she has a bandemia. The source of her hypotension is likely driven by cardiac compromise, possibly due to RV vascular distribution ischemia and increased RV afterload. She has a urinary source suspected, but diarrhea is not clearly confirmed. Her current source of elevated pulmonary artery pressures remains undefined.

Potential medical complications:

1. Shock: Vasodilatory component - ongoing treatment with CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff. Cardiogenic component - possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as well. Treatment for possible PE would be favored if bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT is negative for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive.
2. Bradycardia: Telemetry, inotrope, and chronotrope support for pressors. RV leads will be used to ensure no ongoing insult in the setting of stable enzymes.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN. Continue support of BP, and monitor for evolving process consistent with ATN.
4. Respiratory failure: Patient is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and her SpO2 is 87%. ABG results show a pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 37, and pO2 of 70.
5. Cardiac compromise: Patient's cardiac function is impaired, with significant impairment in RV function and elevated pulmonary artery pressures. She has a high BNP, and her ECHO findings suggest RV vascular distribution ischemia.
6. Sepsis: Patient has a history of sepsis, and her condition has worsened. She has a bandemia and suspected urinary source, but diarrhea is not clearly confirmed.
7. Infection: Patient has a urinary source suspected, but diarrhea is not clearly confirmed. Cultures are pending.
8. Bleeding risk: Patient's treatment for possible PE would be favored if bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT is negative for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment with CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff.
2. Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors to manage bradycardia.
3. Continue support of BP to manage acute renal failure.
4. Monitor patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor patient's cardiac function and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Monitor patient's infection status and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider treatment for possible PE if bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT is negative for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis that is not specified in the note. The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including nuclear medicine and ultrasound scans. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, and has been monitored for vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, and fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 104/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic parameters are also stable, with a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure of 87 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as elevated levels of creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of mortality.
3. Cardiac Injury: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac injury, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of mortality.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and decreased oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory distress and increased risk of mortality.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and increased risk of mortality.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate the presence of deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and increased risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, and laboratory results closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent morbidity and mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pressors, and diuretics. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/39 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 95%.

The patient has undergone several tests, including a Q scan, ultrasound, and blood work. The Q scan showed a low probability of pulmonary embolism, while the ultrasound revealed hydronephrosis and hydroureter. The blood work showed elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate, and anion gap acidosis.

The patient's diagnosis is complex and multifaceted. The differential diagnosis includes septic shock, hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, and right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis. The patient is also at risk for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest the possibility of septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.5-2, and she has developed acute renal failure. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the need for dialysis.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can lead to seizures, coma, and even death if left untreated.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate and anion gap acidosis can lead to respiratory acidosis, which can be life-threatening.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's risk factors for pulmonary embolism, including her cancer and immobility, make it a potential complication that needs to be considered and monitored.
6. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's risk factors for deep vein thrombosis, including her immobility and cancer, make it a potential complication that needs to be considered and monitored.
7. Right heart infarct: The patient's echocardiogram showing a dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis suggests the possibility of a right heart infarct, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and even death.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications early on."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation diarrhea was thought to be
   the etiology of her hypotension but the patient has not had any BMs
   since admission. Her other cultures are pending, with urine growing
   E.coli pan-sensitive to current abx. She has remained afebrile, with
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider
   PE, however V/Q scan showed low probablility. Also on the differential
   diagnosis is right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the
   setting of what appears to be bradycardia.  Patient is now off pressors
   but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - cont ceftriaxone for E.coli UTI
   -d/c flagyl as unlikely c.diff
   - f/u pending cultures
   - off pressors now but may need to restart if not fluid responsive
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. Urine ctx with E.coli which
   may have caused sepsis? Blood cultures still pending.  Also CBC today
   with decreased plt, WBC and hematocrit.  [**Month (only) 8**] be drug related (ie. HIT-
   thrombocytopenia).
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   -repeat CBC
   -if hct is decreased consider guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Her initial FeNa 0.6% which supported
   pre-renal etiology; on repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   -consult renal
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Monday ask lab to spin urine
   Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia despite high CVP (pt has
   TR which can falsely elevate CVP measurements). Will continue to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
* She has been treated with antibiotics for E. coli UTI, but cultures are pending.
* Her initial presentation suggested hypovolemic shock, but her clinical status has not changed, and she appears comfortable on examination.
* The patient has been off pressors but still maintains a low MAP while sleeping.
* She has a dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis on echocardiogram, which may suggest pulmonary embolism (PE) or right heart infarct.
* The V/Q scan showed a low probability of PE.
* The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2, likely due to chronic insults from hypertension and diabetes.
* She has hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis, and elevated lactate levels.
* The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, and cervical cancer with sacral metastases.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's rising WBC count, hypotension, and pending cultures, sepsis remains a concern.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low voltage EKG and hypotension may indicate cardiogenic shock, which needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
3. Right heart infarct: The patient's echocardiogram findings suggest a dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis, which may be indicative of a right heart infarct.
4. Pulmonary embolism: Although the V/Q scan showed a low probability of PE, it cannot be entirely ruled out.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI if not managed properly.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and anion gap acidosis need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's cervical cancer with sacral metastases may progress, leading to further complications.
8. Infection: The patient's UTI and pending cultures may indicate a more widespread infection, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

1. Continue antibiotics for E. coli UTI and monitor cultures.
2. Consult renal services to manage acute renal failure and prevent AKI.
3. Monitor electrolyte levels and manage hyponatremia and anion gap acidosis.
4. Consider repeating CT scans to evaluate metastatic disease progression.
5. Monitor the patient's clinical status and adjust treatment plans as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension, diarrhea, and acute renal failure (ARF). She has a history of stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cervical cancer. The patient has been receiving fluids and pressors, which have been discontinued. Her urine cultures are growing E. coli, and she is being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has hydronephrosis on ultrasound and is awaiting a renal consult. Her platelet count has decreased, and she will have a recheck of her complete blood count (CBC).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's hypotension and positive urine cultures for E. coli suggest the possibility of septic shock. This can lead to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's ARF is worsening, and her creatinine levels are increasing. AKI can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Complications:** The patient's UTI can lead to complications such as sepsis, pyelonephritis, and kidney abscesses.
4. **Cervical Cancer/NSCLC Progression:** The patient's underlying cancer history may be progressing, which can lead to worsening symptoms, organ dysfunction, and decreased quality of life.
5. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's decreased platelet count can lead to bleeding complications, including petechiae, ecchymoses, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. **Hydronephrosis:** The patient's hydronephrosis can lead to kidney damage, chronic kidney disease, and increased risk of kidney stones.
7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** The patient's limited oral intake and potential malnutrition can lead to weakness, fatigue, and decreased immune function.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of septic shock or AKI.
2. Continue treatment for UTI and monitor for signs of complications.
3. Consult with the renal team to optimize management of ARF and hydronephrosis.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
5. Consider consults with the oncology and urology teams to optimize management of the patient's underlying cancer history.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient received antibiotics, including Metronidazole and Ceftriaxone, and has been experiencing ATN (acute tubular necrosis) with muddy brown casts in urine. The patient has also been diagnosed with L-sided hydro with a potential stent placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 35.9°C, Tcurrent of 35.8°C, HR of 54 bpm, BP of 97/42 mmHg, RR of 15 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 93%. The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 30.2, Hct of 30.0, Plt of 132, Cr of 4.1, and TropT of 0.05.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ATN: The patient's condition is complicated by acute tubular necrosis, which may lead to chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. L-sided hydro: The patient's diagnosis of L-sided hydro may lead to complications such as sepsis, pyelonephritis, and chronic kidney disease.
3. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and may require anticoagulation therapy.
4. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and may require proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists.
5. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and may require antibiotic therapy.
6. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent hyperglycemia and its complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, which may lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to ATN, L-sided hydro, and other comorbidities, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent sepsis and its complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation diarrhea was thought to be
   the etiology of her hypotension but the patient has not had any BMs
   since admission. Her other cultures are pending, with urine growing
   E.coli pan-sensitive to current abx. She has remained afebrile, with
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider
   PE, however V/Q scan showed low probablility. Also on the differential
   diagnosis is right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the
   setting of what appears to be bradycardia.  Patient is now off pressors
   but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - cont ceftriaxone for E.coli UTI
   -d/c flagyl as unlikely c.diff
   - f/u pending cultures
   - off pressors now but may need to restart if not fluid responsive
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. Urine ctx with E.coli which
   may have caused sepsis? Blood cultures still pending.  Also CBC today
   with decreased plt, WBC and hematocrit.  [**Month (only) 8**] be drug related (ie. HIT-
   thrombocytopenia).
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   -repeat CBC
   -if hct is decreased consider guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Her initial FeNa 0.6% which supported
   pre-renal etiology; on repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   -consult renal
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Monday ask lab to spin urine
   Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia despite high CVP (pt has
   TR which can falsely elevate CVP measurements). Will continue to
   support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed. [**Month (only) 8**] need to
   give NaHCO3 as well to increase bicarb while ATN resolves.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, fluids, and pressors, but remains hypotensive with a low mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55-60 mmHg. Her urine output is low, and she has developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and anion gap acidosis. She has also been diagnosed with E. coli UTI and is being treated with ceftriaxone. The patient has a complex medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, which may have contributed to her current condition.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: Despite being afebrile, the patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest septic shock, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low voltage EKG and dilated right ventricle on echo suggest cardiogenic shock, which needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
3. Right heart infarct: The patient's RV hypokinesis and bradycardia suggest a possible right heart infarct, which needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low lung compliance and high PaO2/FiO2 ratio suggest ARDS, which needs to be monitored and treated promptly.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and possible gastrointestinal bleeding need to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
6. Infection: The patient's E. coli UTI and possible septic shock suggest that she may have a systemic infection, which needs to be treated promptly and aggressively.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and ATN need to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
8. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis needs to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and possible electrolyte imbalance need to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
10. Cervical cancer/NSCLC: The patient's known sacral metastases need to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypotention: To date unclear exactly why patient continues to be
   hypotensive. Septic shock at this point is unlikely given negative
   cultures, down trending WBC and no fevers. Cardiogenic and obstructive
   shock have been ruled out. Distributive shock is not consistent with
   presentation and clinical exam. Cortisol and TSH labs were appropriate
   and did not support adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. Patient is
   now off pressors but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping. There
   is question of autonomic dysfunction secondary to diabetes or
   chemotherapy treatments in the past. She has known neuropathy which
   could support this theory.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - d/c ceftriaxone as last UCx negative
   - check orthostasis
    - f/u pending cultures
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission. WBC has continued to trend downward.
   Given leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia would consider a transient
   viral infection which may have caused her fever, white count and
   diarrhea, and caused her decompensation.  Also noted is a drop in her
   hematocrit over the last two days. It has actually trended down towards
   her baseline but will guaiac stools and trend CBC to be safe.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - follow pending cultures
   - repeat CBC
   - guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Renal consult noted muddy brown casts on
   urine, recommended to check LDH, schistocytes, FeNa and repeat renal US
   on Monday. Urology is also following and found L sided hydroureter on
   imaging. Debating whether intervention is necessary and is playing any
   role in her ATN (? Why isn
t other kidney picking up the slack?)
   -Renal US tomorrow
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -follow pending labs and smear
   -f/u any new renal and urology recs
   Hyponatremia: Resolved since admission and NS fluid boluses. Will
   continue to support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Resolved since admission.
   - follow chemistry
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 97/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung examination, soft and nontender abdomen, and no edema or cyanosis.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including fluid boluses, discontinuation of ceftriaxone, and monitoring of orthostasis. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.0 mg/dL. The renal consult has recommended checking LDH, schistocytes, FeNa, and repeating renal US on Monday.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Autonomic dysfunction secondary to diabetes or chemotherapy treatments, which may lead to hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Transient viral infection, which may cause fever, white count, and diarrhea, and potentially lead to decompensation.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Hyponatremia, which may lead to seizures or coma if not properly managed.
5. Anion gap acidosis, which may worsen if not addressed.
6. Cervical cancer/NSCLC progression, which may require further treatment and management.
7. Diabetic ketoacidosis, which may occur if the patient's blood sugar levels become too high.
8. Hypertensive crisis, which may require urgent treatment to prevent cardiovascular complications.

Given the patient's complex medical conditions and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely, and to adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with stg 3 NSCLCa, cervical Ca, initially presenting
   with worsening diarrhea, E.Coli UTI and admitted for hypotension. She
   is no longer on pressors but continues to require intermittent fluid
   resuscitation to maintain MAP>60's. She is on appropriate abx for
   E.coli UTI, and so far, her hypotension workup has included Echo, V/Q
   (low prob), random cortisol level which have not identified another
   reason for the shock.
   MAP
s continue to intermittently drop though mostly overnight and
   improved after awakening
   -continue fluid bolus as needed- CVP
s may be artificially elevated
   because of TR
   -check orthostatis/eval autonomic function
   ARF: W/u includes ATN, may have post-obstructive component.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, admitted for hypotension. She has been receiving fluid resuscitation and antibiotics for E. coli UTI. Her hypotension workup has included echocardiogram, V/Q scan, and random cortisol level, but no other cause has been identified. She is currently on intermittent fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 116/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her physical examination is notable for diminished breath sounds on the right base and a right pleural effusion on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's history of lung cancer and pleural effusion, there is a high risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for intermittent fluid resuscitation suggest the possibility of septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and she has a history of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which increases the risk of AKI.
4. Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and elevated international normalized ratio (INR) suggest the possibility of sepsis-induced coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding and organ failure.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of lung cancer and pleural effusion increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac tamponade or pulmonary embolism.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli suggest the possibility of neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or sepsis-induced encephalopathy.
7. Infection: The patient's history of E. coli UTI and presence of a urinary catheter increase the risk of developing a new infection, such as pneumonia or catheter-associated urinary tract infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. He has been treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has shown improvement, with his blood pressure returning to baseline and his heart rate stabilizing. He remains on IV fluids and has been weaned off pressor support. His creatinine levels remain elevated, and he has evidence of hydronephrosis, which will require a nephrostomy tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's creatinine levels remain elevated, and he has muddy brown casts in his urine, which is consistent with ATN. This can lead to chronic kidney disease and potentially require dialysis.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's cultures are negative, his leukocytosis and diarrhea could be indicative of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output could be indicative of hypovolemic shock, which could worsen his kidney function and increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of cancer and his current condition could increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Nutritional Complications: The patient's inability to eat orally and his need for IV fluids could lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Wound Complications: The patient's history of cancer and his current condition could increase his risk of wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of cancer and his current condition could increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

These potential complications will need to be monitored and managed closely to prevent complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 43 mmHg, which is within the normal range.

The patient has a leukocytosis of 26.3 K/uL, which is unclear in etiology at this time. The patient is being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with ceftriaxone, and urine cultures have been negative. The patient has also had a leukocytosis since admission, which is uncertain in etiology.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2, and a renal consult has noted muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has moderate left-sided hydronephrosis, and urology is following the patient for possible nephrostomy tube placement.

The patient has hyponatremia, which has resolved since admission, and anion gap acidosis, which is likely secondary to lactic acidosis and renal failure. The patient has known sacral metastases from cervical cancer and NSCLC, and oncology is following the patient.

The patient is off pressors and oral anti-hypertensives, and oral medications are being held. The patient is receiving IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient has ATN, which can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's cultures are negative, the patient's leukocytosis and UTI treatment suggest that sepsis is a possible complication.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly sodium and potassium, need to be closely monitored to avoid imbalances.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient is off pressors, which can lead to cardiovascular instability if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's UTI and leukocytosis suggest that infection is a possible complication, and the patient's immune system may be compromised due to cancer and chemotherapy.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is not mentioned in the note, and the patient may require nutritional support to prevent deficiencies.
7. Psychological distress: The patient's cancer diagnosis and treatment may cause significant psychological distress, which needs to be addressed by the healthcare team.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, who was admitted with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, but has been ruled out as sepsis, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. The patient is currently off pressor support and is receiving IV fluids for decreased urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60. The patient has leukocytosis, which is uncertain in etiology, and has been afebrile. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is being followed by urology for possible stenting. The patient's hyponatremia and anion gap acidosis have resolved since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's ARF with muddy brown casts consistent with ATN is a significant concern. ATN can lead to chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Sepsis: Although sepsis has been ruled out, the patient's leukocytosis and ARF make sepsis a potential complication. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological systems.
3. Cervical Cancer Progression: The patient's known sacral metastases and history of cervical cancer increase the risk of cancer progression and recurrence.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be a sign of underlying infection, malabsorption, or medication side effects. Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and current off-pressors status make hypertension a potential complication. Hypertension can lead to cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac failure.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and current glycemic control measures make hyperglycemia a potential complication. Hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperglycemic syndrome, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support and potential respiratory failure make respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, a potential concern.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and current off-pressors status make cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, and arrhythmias, a potential concern."
