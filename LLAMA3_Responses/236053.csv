   [**12-14**]
   - Hct 34.5 --> 27.9 --> 1u PRBC's --> 34.5
   - GI bleed study --> f/u
   - High bp's to 180's-190's overnight. Given 20mg IV Lasix. Called at MN
   to reassess. BP's still in 180's. Pt had been given 1.5L NS in the ED,
   got blood products, and was getting Golytely prep, and only -100cc's
   negative at MN. So, if 3am and still HTN, wrote for 20mg IV Lasix x1.
   - Getting prepped for c-scope in the am, called by nurse who said she
   is not clearing well, had to be manually disimpacted and nowhere near
   clear. Continuing prep and need to contact GI in am.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)
   Assessment and Plan:
   [**Age over 90 212**]F with CAD, diastolic CHF, history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and
   telangectasia, presenting with BRBPR.
   1. BRBPR--GI plans to take to colonoscopy today but pt has not cleared
   with Golytely. Continue aggressive prep PO today as pt refuses NGT.
   Touch base with GI and make plan for pt.  Keep active T&S, and has
   units crossmatched. Consider Lasix with transfusions. Has 2 large bore
   PIV's. Hold ASA and Plavix. Avoid hypotension, keep bp's 140-160.
   Deferring surgical consult as pt doesn't want surgery, if no other
   resort, would make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].
   2. HTN--PT seen to have rising bp's through yesterday to 180-190's.
   Given 20mg IV Lasix yesterday and reasonable to diuresis gently some
   more, as pt has gotten IVF's and is net positive since coming here. Has
   h/o CHF so need to keep her negative or even. Assess later and give
   Lasix if necessary.
   3. CAD.  s/p multiple BMS placements in the past.  Maintained on ASA
   and plavix.
   - Hold ASA and plavix for now, as no new or drug eluting stents in
   place.  Consider platelet transfusion.
   - Continue statin.
   4. Afib.  Paroxysmal, currently in sinus.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - No coumadin.
   5. Diastolic CHF.  Preserved EF, some PA HTN.
   - Watch respiratory status with transfusions, IV lasix prn.
   - Hold PO lasix for now, will give IV if/when needed.
   - Not on BB or anti-HTNs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to a sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She is currently in the ICU due to a gastrointestinal bleed, which is being managed with aggressive prep for colonoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm (normal range: 54-89 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 186/62 mmHg (normal range: 140/49-195/88 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 8-23 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Hematocrit: 33.1% (normal range: 36-46%)
* Platelet count: 326 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's medical conditions and medications are as follows:

* Coronary artery disease with a history of multiple balloon-mounted stent placements
* Diastolic congestive heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction
* Afib, currently in sinus rhythm
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to a sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia
* Medications: amiodarone, statin, and proton pump inhibitor

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Hemorrhagic shock due to continued gastrointestinal bleeding
* Hypotension due to dehydration and blood loss
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
* Renal failure due to decreased perfusion
* Sepsis due to potential infection

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Aggressive prep for colonoscopy
* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Maintenance of hydration and electrolyte balance
* Avoidance of hypotension and hypovolemia
* Consideration of platelet transfusion
* Continued statin therapy
* Monitoring of respiratory status and glycemic control

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan:
   [**Age over 90 212**]F with CAD, diastolic CHF, history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and
   telangectasia, presenting with BRBPR.
   1. BRBPR--GI plans to take to colonoscopy today but pt has not cleared
   with Golytely. Continue aggressive prep PO today as pt refuses NGT.
   Touch base with GI and make plan for pt.  Keep active T&S, and has
   units crossmatched. Consider Lasix with transfusions. Has 2 large bore
   PIV's. Hold ASA and Plavix. Avoid hypotension, keep bp's 140-160.
   Deferring surgical consult as pt doesn't want surgery, if no other
   resort, would make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].
   2. HTN--PT seen to have rising bp's through yesterday to 180-190's.
   Given 20mg IV Lasix yesterday and reasonable to diuresis gently some
   more, as pt has gotten IVF's and is net positive since coming here. Has
   h/o CHF so need to keep her negative or even. Assess later and give
   Lasix if necessary.
   3. CAD.  s/p multiple BMS placements in the past.  Maintained on ASA
   and plavix.
   - Hold ASA and plavix for now, as no new or drug eluting stents in
   place.  Consider platelet transfusion.
   - Continue statin.
   4. Afib.  Paroxysmal, currently in sinus.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - No coumadin.
   5. Diastolic CHF.  Preserved EF, some PA HTN.
   - Watch respiratory status with transfusions, IV lasix prn.
   - Hold PO lasix for now, will give IV if/when needed.
   - Not on BB or anti-HTNs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**12-14**]
   - Hct 34.5 --> 27.9 --> 1u PRBC's --> 34.5
   - GI bleed study --> f/u
   - High bp's to 180's-190's overnight. Given 20mg IV Lasix. Called at MN
   to reassess. BP's still in 180's. Pt had been given 1.5L NS in the ED,
   got blood products, and was getting Golytely prep, and only -100cc's
   negative at MN. So, if 3am and still HTN, wrote for 20mg IV Lasix x1.
   - Getting prepped for c-scope in the am, called by nurse who said she
   is not clearing well, had to be manually disimpacted and nowhere near
   clear. Continuing prep and need to contact GI in am.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She was admitted with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and is currently being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 186/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Blood glucose: 92 mg/dL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 27.9 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 34.5%
* Platelet count: 326 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Soft abdomen
* Poor mental status, awake and alert but not responding to questions
* No bleeding edema in the extremities
* No skin lesions

The patient's medications include:

* Furosemide (Lasix) 20mg IV
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40mg IV
* Aspirin (ASA) held
* Plavix held
* Statin continued

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue aggressive prep for colonoscopy
* Monitor hemodynamics and adjust Lasix as necessary
* Consider platelet transfusion
* Continue statin
* Hold PO Lasix for now, will give IV if/when needed
* Monitor respiratory status with transfusions
* Replete electrolytes

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypotension due to excessive diuresis with Lasix
* Respiratory distress due to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to inadequate prep for colonoscopy or underlying gastrointestinal disease
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances or underlying cardiac disease
* Renal insufficiency due to dehydration or underlying kidney disease

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's hemodynamics, respiratory status, and gastrointestinal function to prevent these potential complications."

   - GI: not adequately prepped, [**Last Name (un) **] delayed until tomorrow.
   - hypertensive through the day.  Not on antihypertensives here.  Spoke
   with daughter.  Doesn't think she's in pain.  Gave IV lopressory once,
   only worked temporarily.  Gave PO lopressor with mild improvement.
   - Daughter at bedside, very upset that she was not aware that pt not
   stooling clear until this morning.  Says she will stay until stooling
   clear tonight, and really wants [**Last Name (un) **] to happen in AM.
   - At midnight, loose stools but not completely clear.
   - Pt also received 20 mg IV Lasix
   This morning, stools continue loose but not clear. Daughter talked to
   nursing last night about not wanting colonoscopy, worried that this is
   too aggressive.

   - GI: not adequately prepped, [**Last Name (un) **] delayed until tomorrow.
   - hypertensive through the day.  Not on antihypertensives here.  Spoke
   with daughter.  Doesn't think she's in pain.  Gave IV lopressory once,
   only worked temporarily.  Gave PO lopressor with mild improvement.
   - Daughter at bedside, very upset that she was not aware that pt not
   stooling clear until this morning.  Says she will stay until stooling
   clear tonight, and really wants [**Last Name (un) **] to happen in AM.
   - At midnight, loose stools but not completely clear.
   - Pt also received 20 mg IV Lasix
   This morning, stools continue loose but not clear. Daughter talked to
   nursing last night about not wanting colonoscopy, worried that this is
   too aggressive.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 96-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of benign hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 157/50 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute (bpm), and her oxygen saturation is 99%. Her physical examination reveals severe ulceration of the buttocks bilaterally, with blistering, and no signs of active bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 326 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L. Her renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol, which were held due to her recent gastrointestinal bleeding. She is also taking pantoprazole (Protonix) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of LGIB and her current gastrointestinal bleeding make her at risk for further bleeding.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she may be at risk for further hypertension-related complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's severe ulceration of the buttocks bilaterally, with blistering, makes her at risk for further skin breakdown and infection.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and CHF make her at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's mildly impaired renal function makes her at risk for further decline in renal function.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, skin breakdown, cardiac complications, and renal insufficiency. She requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent these complications and ensure her safe discharge to home."

Summary:

The patient is a 96-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) due to sigmoid ulcer and telangiectasia. She was admitted to the ICU with benign hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Her current condition is stable, with no evidence of active bleeding. She has been deferred from colonoscopy due to the presence of loose stools, and her daughter is monitoring her for signs of bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue, and she may require further management, including endoscopy or surgical intervention.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may persist, and she may require further antihypertensive therapy to control her blood pressure.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown on her buttocks may worsen, and she may require further wound care and management.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and diastolic heart failure may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's age and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels may continue to be a concern, particularly if she develops dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of LGIB may increase her risk of infection, particularly if she develops an open wound or abscess.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen if she is unable to eat or if her nutritional needs are not being met.
9. Medication-related complications: The patient's medications, including her anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, may cause complications, such as bleeding or allergic reactions.
10. Psychological complications: The patient's age and underlying medical conditions may lead to psychological complications, such as depression, anxiety, or cognitive impairment."

Summary:

The patient is a [**Last Name (un) **] who was admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition has not improved significantly over the past 24 hours, with loose stools continuing despite treatment. The patient's daughter is present and concerned about the patient's condition, particularly the lack of clear stools. The patient is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, furosemide, and metoprolol, and has a history of hypertension, tetracycline allergy, and unknown allergies.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's loose stools and lack of clear stools suggest that the bleeding may not have stopped, which can lead to further complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, and potentially life-threatening bleeding.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension has not been adequately controlled, which can lead to hypertensive crisis, cardiac complications, and stroke.
3. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of infection, particularly sepsis and septic shock.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant amount of fluid being administered, which can lead to fluid overload, cardiac complications, and respiratory distress.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's impaired gastrointestinal function may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate the patient's underlying conditions.
6. Medication side effects: The patient is receiving multiple medications, which can interact with each other and lead to side effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression.
7. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's underlying conditions, such as hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding, can compromise respiratory function and lead to respiratory failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's safety."

   24 Hour Events:
   - GI: not adequately prepped, [**Last Name (un) **] delayed until tomorrow.
   - hypertensive through the day.  Not on antihypertensives here.  Spoke
   with daughter.  Doesn't think she's in pain.  Gave IV lopressory once,
   only worked temporarily.  Gave PO lopressor with mild improvement.
   - Daughter at bedside, very upset that she was not aware that pt not
   stooling clear until this morning.  Says she will stay until stooling
   clear tonight, and really wants [**Last Name (un) **] to happen in AM.
   - At midnight, loose stools but not completely clear.
   - Pt also received 20 mg IV Lasix
   This morning, stools continue loose but not clear. Daughter talked to
   nursing last night about not wanting colonoscopy, worried that this is
   too aggressive.

   Assessment and Plan:
   96F with CAD, diastolic CHF, history of LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and
   telangectasia, presenting with BRBPR.
   1. BRBPR--GI plans to take to colonoscopy today but pt has not cleared
   with Golytely, got 1L yesterday evening. Will discuss with daughter as
   she seems to be wanting less aggressive measures, unclear if she would
   like colonoscopy today. Touch base with GI and make plan for pt.  Keep
   active T&S, and has units crossmatched. Consider Lasix with
   transfusions. Has 2 large bore PIV's. Hold ASA and Plavix. Avoid
   hypotension, keep bp's 140-160. Deferring surgical consult as pt
   doesn't want surgery, if no other resort, would make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].
   2. HTN--PT seen to have rising bp's through yesterday to 200s. Given
   20mg IV Lasix yesterday and reasonable to diuresis gently some more, as
   pt has gotten IVF's and is net positive since coming here (LOS +2.5L).
   Has h/o CHF so need to keep her negative or even. Will give Lasix today
   with a goal of negative today to improve overall LOS fluid balance.
   Also given lopressor IV with some response.
   -Lasix 20mg IV now, reassess later will probably need another 20mg IV
   given that she has not been negative with 20 mg IV yesterday
   -Consider home medication regimen, may want to add beta blocker or HCTZ
   3. Skin breakdown: patient appears to have significant skin breakdown
   on buttocks after receiving prep. Apparently had some ulceration prior
   to prep, but worse now.
   -Wound care consult
   4. CAD.  s/p multiple BMS placements in the past.  Maintained on ASA
   and plavix.
   - Hold ASA and plavix for now, as no new or drug eluting stents in
   place.  Consider platelet transfusion.
   - Continue statin.
   5. Afib.  Paroxysmal, currently in sinus.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   - No coumadin.
   6. Diastolic CHF.  Preserved EF, some PA HTN.
   - Watch respiratory status with transfusions, IV lasix prn.
   - Hold PO lasix for now, will give IV if/when needed.
   - Not on BB or anti-HTNs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 96-year-old female with a history of CAD, diastolic CHF, and LGIB due to sigmoid ulcer and telangectasia. She is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertension, benign, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleed. She has not cleared with Golytely prep and is not willing to undergo colonoscopy. She has been given IV Lopressor with mild improvement and IV Lasix with diuresis. Her skin has significant breakdown on her buttocks, and she has been given a wound care consult. She has a history of CAD, AFib, and diastolic CHF, and is currently on amiodarone and statin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is not fully cleared, and she is at risk for further bleeding.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for further complications such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown on her buttocks is severe and at risk for further deterioration, leading to infection and potential sepsis.
4. Heart failure: The patient's diastolic CHF is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for further decompensation, leading to respiratory failure and death.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of AFib and paroxysmal AFib puts her at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
6. Infection: The patient's skin breakdown and gastrointestinal bleed put her at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and death.
7. Renal failure: The patient's hypertension and diuresis with IV Lasix put her at risk for renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and death.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's diastolic CHF and hypertension put her at risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to death.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications and death due to her underlying medical conditions and current medical status."
