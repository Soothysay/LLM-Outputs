   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.  Has been on heparin gtt
   overnight.
   - DC heparin gtt
   - continue ASA, Plavix, statin
   - transfuse RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - will not likely pursue a cath
   - BB and ACE for BP control
   .
   # Anemia:
   Known to be guaiac positive, although per pt's history, had had
   aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross since then. Likely
   lower GI bleed from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests
   upper GI source vs contraction.   Hct from this AM drawn prior to
   completion of transfusion, not accurate post-transfusion Hct.
   - GI will do upper and lower endoscopy on Monday
   - f/u iron panel
   - f/u post transfusion Hct today
   - maintain good IV access
   - type and cross, transfuse to Hct 25 given suspicion of active
   ischemia
   - IV Famotidine
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: improving.  Afebrile but negative UA and CXR.
   - will continue to monitor.
   .
   #  Hypertension:
   Started on labetalol last night to help w blood pressure control and
   nitro drip being weaned off.  Found home medications from pharmacy.
   - wean off nitro drip and start home Imdur
   - switch home verapamil to carvedilol
   - start home hctz, lisinopril.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple falls, who presented with lightheadedness, anemia, and troponin leak.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 171/71 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. His physical examination is notable for ecchymosis on his left chest, a systolic murmur at the apex, and a diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left USB.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 309 K/uL. His troponin level is elevated at 1.55 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL. His electrocardiogram shows ST depressions laterally, which is unclear whether it is related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed ischemia.

The patient's plan includes discontinuing heparin gtt, continuing aspirin, Plavix, and statin, transfusing red blood cells to achieve a hemoglobin level of 20s, and not pursuing a cardiac catheterization. He will also receive beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for blood pressure control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's troponin leak and ST depressions on his electrocardiogram suggest cardiac ischemia. Further cardiac evaluation, such as a cardiac catheterization, may be necessary to determine the extent of the ischemia.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of gastrointestinal bleeding suggest that he may be at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin level and platelet count is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he may require further treatment to control his hypertension.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia suggest that he may be at risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin level and platelet count is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests that he may be at risk for kidney damage. Close monitoring of his kidney function is necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, which is slightly elevated. Close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory complications.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the cause of the patient's anemia, troponin leak, and leukocytosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and have had an
   NSTEMI.
   .
   # NSTEMI: Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST
   depressions laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally
   distributed ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably
   new given recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic
   - on heparin gtt, ASA, Plavix, statin
   - transfuse RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - likely cath on monday
   - BB and ACE for BP control
   .
   # Anemia: Known to be guaiac positive, although per pt's history, had
   had aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross since then.
   Likely lower GI bleed from known hemarroids.  Elevated BUN suggests
   upper GI source vs contraction.
   - GI aware, will see in AM.
   - obtain OSH records to determine baseline
   - anemia panel, specifically for iron panel
   - serial Hcts, 8-12hrs based on amount of bleeding.
   - maintain good IV access
   - type and cross, transfuse to Hct 25ish given suspicion of active
   ischemia
   - NPO for now, tbw GI in AM - if no plan for scope will allow diet
   - IV Famotidine
   .
   #  Leukocytosis: 14. Afebrile, no localizing symptoms. UA negative, CXR
   negative. Likely stress reaction, will continue to monitor.
   .
   #  Hypertension: Currently 180s/90s, unknown baseline and pt does not
   remember his medications. For now on nitro drip, will add PO
   medications and wean as tolerated. Goal SBP 150s.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple falls who presented with lightheadedness, anemia, hypertension, and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being treated with heparin, aspirin, Plavix, and a statin.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 171/71 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.1%
* Platelet count: 309 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.55 ng/mL
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his anemia and hemodynamic instability. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessable, and his skin, neurologic, and respiratory examinations are not documented.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Bleeding complications due to his anemia and continued bleeding
* Hypertensive crisis due to his hypertension and potential medication non-adherence
* Cardiac complications due to his NSTEMI and ongoing cardiac stress
* Respiratory complications due to his anemia and potential respiratory failure
* Renal complications due to his anemia and potential acute kidney injury
* Infection complications due to his anemia and potential immunosuppression

The patient's plan includes transfusing red blood cells to a hemoglobin level of 25, continuing heparin therapy, and monitoring for bleeding complications. The patient will also undergo a cardiac catheterization on Monday and will be treated with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for blood pressure control."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple falls who presented with lightheadedness, anemia, and a troponin leak. He was found to have a type II MI/demand ischemia, likely related to anemia caused by recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells and is currently asymptomatic.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 169/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His respiratory support consists of nasal cannula oxygen delivery with an ABG result of pH 7.26.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished male with no signs of acute intracranial process or trauma. His cardiac examination shows a normal sinus rhythm with a systolic murmur at the apex and a diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left USB.

Laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level of 1.55 ng/mL, a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, and a hematocrit level of 28.5%. His white blood cell count is 12.4 K/uL, and his platelet count is 330 K/uL.

The patient's imaging studies reveal bilateral basal ganglia calcifications, mild periventricular white matter hypoattenuation, and marked mucosal thickening in the left maxillary antrum. His head CT scan is negative for acute intracranial process or trauma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of type II MI/demand ischemia, he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to bleed or if he has inadequate transfusion support.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to further anemia, bleeding complications, or even death.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's recent fall and head CT scan results suggest that he may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and negative urine and chest X-ray results suggest that he may be at risk for infection, which could worsen his overall condition.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly controlled, leading to further cardiovascular complications.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support may need to be adjusted if his oxygen saturation levels drop or if he develops respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple falls. He was admitted with a chief complaint of NSTEMI and GI bleed. The patient had a troponin leak, likely type II MI, and was found to be anemic and hypertensive. He was treated with heparin, ASA, Plavix, and statin, and was transfused with 2u PRBC yesterday. The patient fell while trying to get out of bed and had a stat head CT, which was negative.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 169/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 1,704 mL, with an input of 1,100 mL and an output of 975 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5, hemoglobin of 24.1, and platelet count of 309. His troponin-T level is 1.55, and his creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute intracranial process, and his neurologic examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin leak and ST depressions on EKG suggest possible cardiac complications. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to bleed, and transfusions may be necessary to maintain a safe hemoglobin level.
3. GI complications: The patient's GI bleed may continue, and further endoscopy may be necessary to evaluate and treat the source of bleeding.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's fall and negative head CT suggest that he may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as head trauma or stroke.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly controlled, and further treatment may be necessary to prevent complications such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
6. DVT: The patient's use of heparin and ASA increases his risk of DVT, and further prophylaxis may be necessary to prevent this complication.
7. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and negative UA and CXR suggest that he may be at risk for infection, and further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to prevent complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications and improve his clinical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's physical examination reveals a normal neurological exam, with no signs of trauma or injury. His cardiac exam shows a normal sinus rhythm, with a systolic murmur at the apex and left upper sternal border. His lung exam is clear, with no wheezes or rhonchi. 

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hematocrit of 29.6%. His troponin level is 1.55 ng/mL, and his CK-MB level is 11 ng/mL. His white blood cell count is 12.3 K/μL, and his platelet count is 61 K/μL. 

The patient's imaging studies show several osseous fragments in the left shoulder joint, which is distended with fluid, and an age-indeterminate anterior/superior subluxation of the left glenohumeral joint. 

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Type II MI/Demand Ischemia: The patient has a known troponin leak, which is trending down. He is asymptomatic and will not likely pursue cardiac catheterization. He will continue ASA and atorvastatin, and will be transfused as needed with RBCs to maintain a hematocrit of upper 20s.
2. Anemia: The patient had an aggressive bleed several days ago and has been guaiac positive since then. He is likely experiencing a lower GI bleed from known internal hemorrhoids. He will have a colonoscopy today in the CCU and will be followed up with an iron panel.
3. Fall: The patient has a history of falls and has experienced a recent fall. He has a head CT that is negative, and he is currently asymptomatic. He will continue to be followed up with a neurologic exam and mental status.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has a stable white blood cell count of 12.3 K/μL. He is afebrile and has a negative urine analysis and chest X-ray. He has no signs of infection and will continue to be monitored.
5. Hypertension: The patient is being treated for hypertension with carvedilol, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. He will start spironolactone and will continue to be monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation
* Infections, such as sepsis or urinary tract infections
* Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures
* Hematological complications, such as bleeding or anemia
* Metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive, and with a troponin leak. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple falls.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/49 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, and the SpO2 is 97%. The patient has a sinus bradycardia and a systolic murmur at the apex and diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left USB.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and hematocrit of 29.6%. The patient's troponin level is 1.55 ng/mL, and the CK-MB level is 11 ng/mL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show several osseous fragments in the left shoulder joint, which is distended with fluid, and an age-indeterminate anterior/superior subluxation of the left glenohumeral joint, likely related to chronic rotator cuff injury. The patient's CT head shows no acute intracranial process, but marked left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.

The patient's plan includes continuing aspirin, atorvastatin, and carvedilol, and transfusing red blood cells to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 20%. The patient will undergo a colonoscopy in the CCU to evaluate the cause of his anemia, and will be followed up with an iron panel. The patient will also receive omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the lower GI tract, which could lead to further anemia and hypovolemic shock.
2. Development of a cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest due to the patient's history of hypertension and troponin leak.
3. Infection or sepsis, which could be exacerbated by the patient's immunocompromised state and history of falls.
4. Respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by the patient's age and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Renal failure, which could be exacerbated by the patient's age, hypertension, and history of hyperlipidemia.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further anemia and hypovolemic shock.
7. Development of a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's history of hypertension and immobility.
8. Worsening of the patient's anemia, which could lead to further complications and decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues.
9. Development of a nosocomial infection, which could be exacerbated by the patient's immobility and history of falls.
10. Further decline in the patient's mental status, which could be exacerbated by the patient's age, history of falls, and potential underlying neurological disorders."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.  Will not likely pursue
   cardiac catheterization.  Hematocrit stable.
   - continue ASA, atorvastatin
   - transfuse as needed RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - continue blood pressure control.
   .
   # Anemia:
   Per patient, had aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross
   since then, has been guaiac positive since then.  Likely lower GI bleed
   from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests upper GI source
   vs contraction. Patient transfused yesterday for hct 26.6.  Colonoscopy
   showed diverticuli yesterday.  Iron panel shows normal TIBC, ferritin
   but low iron.  No new bleeds since night of prep 2 nights ago.
   - GI will do colonoscopy today in CCU this AM
   - start oral iron replacement today.
   - maintain good IV access
   - omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - re-check hct in pm
   .
   # s/p Fall
 head CT negative, no complaints

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 96%
* Height: 69 inches

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress, thin
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Present radial and digital pulses
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: No edema
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.6%
* Platelet count: 348 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 11.7 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.55 ng/mL
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing aspirin and atorvastatin
* Transfusing red blood cells as needed to maintain a hematocrit of 20-30%
* Continuing blood pressure control
* Starting oral iron replacement
* Maintaining good IV access
* Re-checking hematocrit in the evening
* Colonoscopy in the CCU this morning
* Omeprazole 20mg

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the diverticular bleed
* Development of anemia or worsening of anemia
* Hypotension or hypertension
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure
* Neurologic complications such as stroke or seizures
* Infection such as sepsis or urinary tract infection
* Gastrointestinal complications such as perforation or obstruction
* Hemorrhagic complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to identify any potential complications and adjust the medical plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with history of HTN, HL, multiple falls who presented
   with lightheadedness, found to be anemic, hypertensive and s/p troponin
   leak.
   .
   # Type II MI/ Demand Ischemia:
   Known troponin leak to 9 at OSH, trending down. EKG with ST depressions
   laterally unclear if related to hypertrophy or laterally distributed
   ischemia. Likely large contribution of anemia, presumably new given
   recent GI blood loss. Currently asymptomatic.  Will not likely pursue
   cardiac catheterization.  Hematocrit stable.
   - continue ASA, atorvastatin
   - transfuse as needed RBCs to Hct upper 20s.
   - continue blood pressure control.
   .
   # Anemia:
   Per patient, had aggressive bleed several days ago and nothing gross
   since then, has been guaiac positive since then.  Likely lower GI bleed
   from known internal hemorrhoids.  Elevated BUN suggests upper GI source
   vs contraction. Patient transfused yesterday for hct 26.6.  Colonoscopy
   showed diverticuli yesterday.  Iron panel shows normal TIBC, ferritin
   but low iron.  No new bleeds since night of prep 2 nights ago.
   - start oral iron replacement today.
   - maintain good IV access
   - omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - re-check hct in pm
   - follow up as outpatient with GI.
   .
   # s/p Fall
 head CT negative, no complaints

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of Type II NSTEMI secondary to diverticular bleed. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple falls.

The patient's 24-hour events include a TTE showing mild symmetric LVH with mild global hypokinesis, moderate PA systolic hypertension, and increased PCWP. A colonoscopy revealed diverticuli in the sigmoid colon with old blood up to the cecum. The patient's Hct dropped from 29.6 to 26.6, and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 188/67 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his SpO2 is 96%. He is on oxygen therapy, but no respiratory support is required.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent on the left side. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. His neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin level, with a peak value of 9. His creatinine level is elevated, with a value of 0.9 mg/dL. His potassium level is elevated, with a value of 4.1 mEq/L. His magnesium level is within normal limits, and his phosphorus level is slightly elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Type II MI/Demand Ischemia: The patient's troponin leak is trending down, and he is currently asymptomatic. Given his anemia and recent GI blood loss, it is unlikely that he will require cardiac catheterization. He will continue to receive aspirin and atorvastatin, and transfusions will be given as needed to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 20%.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to his recent GI blood loss, and he will start oral iron replacement therapy. He will also continue to receive IV access and omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* s/p Fall: The patient's head CT was negative, and he has no complaints. He will continue to be monitored for any neurologic changes.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocyte count is decreasing, and he has no signs of infection. He will continue to be monitored.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and he will continue to receive antihypertensive medications.

The patient's social situation is notable for his wife being at another hospital, and social work is following up with him. He will be transferred to the medicine floor today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, he is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
* GI bleeding: The patient's recent GI blood loss and anemia make him at risk for further bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated temperature make him at risk for infection.
* Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension and antihypertensive medications make him at risk for a hypertensive crisis.
* Neurologic complications: The patient's recent fall and history of multiple falls make him at risk for neurologic complications such as head trauma, spinal cord injury, and cognitive decline.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's anemia and recent GI blood loss make him at risk for respiratory complications such as respiratory failure and pneumonia."
