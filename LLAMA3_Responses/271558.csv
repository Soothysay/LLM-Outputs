 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated
   .
   FEN - NPO, gentle fluids, replete lytes, replete B12, thiamine and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed fall, with her head striking the ground. She was intubated in the emergency department due to altered mental status. Her laboratory results and imaging studies have been largely unremarkable, except for mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, which were attributed to her violent thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, and has fallen frequently in the past. She is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.3°C (99.2°F), HR 60 bpm, BP 150/44 mmHg, RR 23 insp/min, SpO2 100%
* Respiratory support: Intubated on minimal settings, with a plan to extubate in the morning if she follows commands off sedation
* Neurological status: Altered mental status, with pinpoint pupils and no response to verbal stimuli
* Cardiovascular status: Hypertension, with a blood pressure of 150/44 mmHg
* Renal function: Normal
* Laboratory results: Mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, with a trend towards normalization with gentle fluids; elevated troponin and CK, with a plan to repeat EKG and cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on minimal settings, with a plan to extubate in the morning. However, there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if there is a delay in extubation.
* Infection: The patient has a history of falls and may be at risk for infection, particularly urinary tract infection. The laboratory results show mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, which has trended down to normal with gentle fluids.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmia.
* Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and may be at risk for neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers or bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulation therapy.

The plan of care includes:

* Extubation in the morning if the patient follows commands off sedation
* Repeat EKG and cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
* Fluids for CKs
* Hold anticoagulation therapy for now
* Restart lescol when extubated
* Check B12, Thiamine, and Folate, then replete
* F/u urine cx
* If agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
* Clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old female who was brought to the emergency department after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground. She was intubated in the emergency department for altered mental status and was found to have a mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, which was attributed to her violent thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation. 

The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reports that she falls frequently and is normally seen at a different hospital. The patient's labs were by-in-large unremarkable, with the exception of a mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, which trended down to normal with gentle fluids. 

The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status, fall, impaired skin integrity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and elevated troponin. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to the fall, trauma, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving minimal settings. The plan is to extubate her in the morning if she is following commands off sedation. The patient's lactate has normalized, and her troponin is still in the indeterminate range but has trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this morning. 

The patient has several medications, including propofol, pantoprazole, and heparin, and is receiving gentle fluids, replete lytes, and replete B12, thiamine, and folate. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being transferred to the floor once extubated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving minimal settings, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient is not extubated successfully.

2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count was mildly elevated on admission, and there is a risk of infection if the patient's wounds are not properly cleaned and dressed.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 150/44 mmHg, and there is a risk of hypotension if the patient's blood pressure is not properly managed.

4. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 60 bpm, and there is a risk of bradycardia if the patient's heart rate is not properly managed.

5. Neurological complications: The patient's troponin is elevated, and there is a risk of neurological complications if the patient's heart muscle is damaged.

6. Skin breakdown: The patient has impaired skin integrity, and there is a risk of skin breakdown if the patient's skin is not properly managed.

7. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving gentle fluids, and there is a risk of malnutrition if the patient's nutritional needs are not properly met.

8. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, and there is a risk of delirium if the patient's mental status is not properly managed.

9. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): The patient is intubated, and there is a risk of RSV if the patient is not properly isolated.

10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated, and there is a risk of VAP if the patient's ventilator is not properly managed."

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was
   violently thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With
   gentle fluids and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's
   histroy was obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite
   frequently.  She is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope
   work-ups have been unrevealing todate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was
   violently thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With
   gentle fluids and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's
   histroy was obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite
   frequently.  She is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope
   work-ups have been unrevealing todate.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   .
   Syncope - Per report, pt lost consiousness before she fell.  Per son
   and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of consciousness.
   Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension, MI, or other
   neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive work-up at [**Hospital1 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood glucose 156 in
   field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not available in [**Hospital3 140**]
   records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG, cardiac enzymes negative
   x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to facilitate beta 2-receptor
   blockade and assist with some possible neurogenic causes of her
   symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink anything but coffee that
   he is aware of and is often light-headed when she stands up.  BBlocke
   rnad/or CCB could be contributing to hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - conitnue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now

   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agtation and combativeness.  Liklely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old female who was brought to the emergency department after a witnessed fall, where she struck her head on the ground. She was intubated due to altered mental status and has been in the ICU for 24 hours. Her history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, which has been unrevealing to date. She has a mild elevation in lactate and acidemia, which is attributed to her violent thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation. Her labs are generally unremarkable, except for a mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, which has trended down to normal with gentle fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: Given the patient's history of frequent falls and altered mental status, there is a risk of developing an infection, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and history of falls may be indicative of delirium, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, medication, and underlying medical conditions.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of orthostatic hypotension and the use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers may increase her risk of developing hypotension, particularly if she becomes dehydrated or develops an infection.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's history of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers may increase her risk of developing bradycardia, particularly if she becomes hypotensive or develops an infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure if she becomes dehydrated or develops an infection.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of falls and altered mental status may increase her risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, particularly if she is unable to eat or drink adequately.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's history of falls and altered mental status may increase her risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly if she is unable to move or change positions adequately.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of falls and altered mental status may increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis, particularly if she is unable to move or change positions adequately.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Continue to provide gentle fluids and electrolyte replacement as needed.
3. Consider restarting beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers once the patient is extubated and her condition is stable.
4. Consider checking B12, Thiamine, and Folate levels and repleting as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide enteral nutrition as needed.
6. Consider consulting with a physical therapist to develop a plan for the patient's mobility and positioning.
7. Consider consulting with a wound care specialist to develop a plan for the patient's skin integrity and pressure ulcer prevention."

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative

   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated
   .
   FEN - NPO, gentle fluids, replete lytes, replete B12, thiamine and
   folate
   .
   Proph - Heparin sq, VAP bundle, pneumoboots, PT/OT consult once
   extubated

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to altered mental status, and there is a plan to extubate her in the morning. However, she may experience respiratory distress or failure if her condition worsens.
2. Infection: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count, and her son reports that she falls frequently. This increases the risk of developing an infection, particularly in the lungs or urinary tract.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can be caused by infection, medication, or other underlying medical conditions.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are 97%, but she may experience hypoxia if her respiratory status worsens or if she develops an infection.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is 120/47 mmHg, which may indicate hemodynamic instability. This could be due to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, sodium, and chloride, may be imbalanced due to her underlying medical conditions or medications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 157 K/uL, which is lower than normal. This may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, which may indicate early renal dysfunction.
9. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes, particularly AST and ALT, are elevated. This may indicate liver dysfunction or damage.
10. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she may require supplementation with vitamins and minerals.
11. Skin integrity issues: The patient has diffuse ecchymosis, which may indicate poor skin integrity and increase the risk of skin breakdown or infection.
12. Neurological compromise: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and she may experience worsening of her condition if not properly managed.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and receive appropriate medical treatment. This may include antibiotics for infection, vasopressors for hypotension, and diuretics for fluid overload. The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, and she should receive supplementation with vitamins and minerals as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   # Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - Follow-up blood cx
   - Levofloxacin for PNA
   -  replete B12, Thiamine and Folate
   - f/u urine cx
   # Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.
   Per son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - Carotid dopplers
 follow-up final read
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   # Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - Follow-up blood cx
   - Levofloxacin for PNA
   -  replete B12, Thiamine and Folate
   - f/u urine cx
   # Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.
   Per son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 89-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground. She was intubated in the emergency department for altered mental status, and a thorough work-up was conducted. The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reports that she falls frequently and is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**]. The patient's labs were mostly unremarkable, except for a mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, which was attributed to her violent thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient was intubated in the setting of altered mental status and acute pulmonary issues. After extubation, she developed new hypoxia to mid-80s, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. **Infection:** The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, which trended down to normal with gentle fluids. However, she was started on Levofloxacin for CAP, and her CXR and UA were negative for occult infection.
3. **Elevated Troponin:** The patient's troponin level is still in the indeterminate range but has trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this morning. This may indicate cardiac injury or muscle damage.
4. **Hypertension:** The patient is hypertensive and is currently on HCTZ and amlodipine. However, her blood pressure is being held for now, and orthostatics are to be checked today.
5. **Hyperlipidemia:** The patient has hyperlipidemia and is currently on Lescol at home. She will continue to take Lescol.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient has a history of falls and may be at risk for electrolyte imbalance. Her potassium levels should be monitored closely.
7. **Muscle Weakness:** The patient has muscle wasting and may be at risk for further muscle weakness.
8. **Skin Complications:** The patient has diffuse ecchymosis and may be at risk for skin complications such as pressure ulcers.

**Plan:**

1. Continue gentle volume resuscitation.
2. Hold B-Blocker and calcium channel blocker for now.
3. Check B12, Thiamine, and Folate, then replete.
4. Follow-up carotid Dopplers.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Consider physical therapy and occupational therapy to evaluate the patient's home safety and develop a plan for weaning from oxygen therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old female, is an ICU patient who was admitted after a fall and syncope. She was intubated due to agitation and needed an emergent head CT scan. She was extubated and scheduled to be transferred to the floor yesterday, but developed hypoxia and a right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving levofloxacin for pneumonia, and has a nasogastric tube in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/51 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 95%. Her physical examination reveals a thin patient with diminished breath sounds diffusely and absent radial pulses bilaterally.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.03 ng/mL, indicating possible cardiac damage. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Pneumonia: likely an aspiration pneumonitis
2. Fall/syncope: the patient has a history of recurrent syncope
3. Altered mental status: the patient is not delirious, but has an altered mental status
4. Impaired skin integrity: the patient has a nasogastric tube in place
5. Respiratory failure: the patient is on invasive ventilation

The patient's plan includes:

1. Antibiotics for pneumonia
2. Swallow evaluation
3. Continued oxygen therapy
4. Advair 250/50 for respiratory support
5. Spireva for respiratory support
6. Modify diet according to swallow evaluation
7. PT/OT consult

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient is on invasive ventilation and may require further respiratory support
2. Pneumonia progression: the patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate and may require further antibiotics or respiratory support
3. Cardiac complications: the patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage
4. Gastrointestinal complications: the patient has a nasogastric tube in place and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
5. Skin complications: the patient has impaired skin integrity and may be at risk for skin breakdown or infection
6. Neurological complications: the patient has an altered mental status and may be at risk for further neurological decline."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. They have a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a recent fall. The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and syncope. They are receiving invasive ventilation, levofloxacin for pneumonia, and other medications for various conditions. The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of troponin-T and lactate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they are at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can progress to more severe forms of pneumonia, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Syncope: The patient's history of syncope and negative workup suggest that they may be at risk of future episodes, which could be exacerbated by their critical condition.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, which can increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, which can increase their risk of developing pressure ulcers, infections, or other skin-related complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered mental status and impaired nutrition may increase their risk of malnutrition, which can exacerbate their underlying medical conditions.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be related to delirium, which can be a complication of critical illness, sedation, or other medical conditions.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to their invasive ventilation and compromised immune system.
9. DVT: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT, but they are at risk of developing DVT or pulmonary embolism due to their immobility and critical condition.
10. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and invasive lines make them susceptible to infections, which can be life-threatening in this critical condition."
