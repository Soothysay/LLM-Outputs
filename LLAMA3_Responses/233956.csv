   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism.
   Presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain. Recently returned
   from [**Country 3310**].
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy:
   Concerning that patient has diagnosis of HIV (though CD4 was 288 on
   [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable) and additionally has
   immunosuppression related to chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and
   Remicade. UA was slightly positive in the ED and may contribute to
   fevers, though an underwhelming explanation of fevers up to 103 and
   facial lymphadenopathy. Patient reported to have dental infections in
   the past; however, no current evidence to suggest a dental etiology.
   Patient has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has
   experienced flares in the past during which her course has been marked
   by submental lymphadenopathy, fever, and hypotension. Patient was in
   [**Country 3310**] without malarial prophylaxis, so will need to rule-out malaria.
   Meningitis seems unlikely to cause this degree of lymphadenopathy;
   further, patient's loss of supple neck is easily confused with an exam
   limited by pain from lymphadenopathy. Distant possibility is
   hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which would be hard to distinguish
   clinically from adult Still's disease flare given that both can present
   with fever, lymphadenopathy, increased ferritin level. Going against
   HLH is the patient's prior diagnosis of adult Still's along with
   abscence of two-line cytopenia associated with HLH.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, at increased dosing for meningitis pending final CSF
   results
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal
   serologies, HBV viral load
   - Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending
   that result
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Consult rheumatology for assistance in management of adult Still's
   flare
   - Trend ferritin
   - Trend CBC and check triglycerides and fibrinogen level for HLH
   #. Hypotension:
   Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia and
   distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital in
   past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on broad
   spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that time.
   - Fluid boluses with goal of decreased pressor requirement and
   increased UOP
   - Support blood pressure with vasoactive agents
   - Patient being broadly treated with Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin at
   this time
   - Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6H for stress dose steroids in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. HIV:
   Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and undetectable
   VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease:
   Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with fever, neck pain, and facial pain. She recently returned from [Country 3310] without malarial prophylaxis. The patient has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has experienced flares in the past. The current presentation is concerning for meningitis, but the patient's lymphadenopathy is unusual for this diagnosis. The patient is also at risk for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) given her immunosuppressed state and the presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, and increased ferritin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms are concerning for meningitis, but the diagnosis is uncertain due to the unusual presentation.
2. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): The patient's immunosuppressed state, fever, lymphadenopathy, and increased ferritin levels make HLH a possibility.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial and may be due to hypovolemia, distributive/septic physiology, and chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression.
4. Infection: The patient's recent travel to [Country 3310] and lack of malarial prophylaxis make malaria a possibility.
5. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection increases her risk for opportunistic infections and may affect her immune system's ability to respond to other infections.
6. Adult Still's disease flare: The patient's symptoms are concerning for a flare of her adult Still's disease, which may require treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's chronic use of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents may have caused adrenal insufficiency, which could worsen her hypotension.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin pending final CSF results.
2. Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal serologies, and HBV viral load.
3. Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending that result.
4. Consult rheumatology for assistance in managing the patient's adult Still's disease flare.
5. Trend ferritin, CBC, triglycerides, and fibrinogen levels to monitor for HLH.
6. Fluid boluses with the goal of decreasing pressor requirement and increasing urine output.
7. Support blood pressure with vasoactive agents.
8. Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov (ATRIPLA) and prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily.
9. Hold on Remicade and methotrexate at this time.
10. Monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism.
   Presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain. Recently returned
   from [**Country 3310**].
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy:
   Concerning that patient has diagnosis of HIV (though CD4 was 288 on
   [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable) and additionally has
   immunosuppression related to chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and
   Remicade. UA was slightly positive in the ED and may contribute to
   fevers, though an underwhelming explanation of fevers up to 103 and
   facial lymphadenopathy. Patient reported to have dental infections in
   the past; however, no current evidence to suggest a dental etiology.
   Patient has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has
   experienced flares in the past during which her course has been marked
   by submental lymphadenopathy, fever, and hypotension. Meningitis seems
   unlikely to cause this degree of lymphadenopathy; further, patient's
   loss of supple neck is easily confused with an exam limited by pain
   from lymphadenopathy. Distant possibility is hemophagocytic
   lymphohistiocytosis, which would be hard to distinguish clinically from
   adult Still's disease flare given that both can present with fever,
   lymphadenopathy, increased ferritin level. Going against HLH is the
   patient's prior diagnosis of adult Still's along with abscence of
   two-line cytopenia associated with HLH.  Cryptococcal and malaria
   negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, at increased dosing for meningitis pending final CSF
   results
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal
   serologies, HBV viral load
   - Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending
   that result
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Consult rheumatology for assistance in management of adult Still's
   flare
   - Trend ferritin
   - Trend CBC and check triglycerides and fibrinogen level for HLH
   #. Hypotension:
   Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia and
   distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital in
   past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on broad
   spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that time.
   - Fluid boluses with goal of decreased pressor requirement and
   increased UOP, however UOP has been min 80cc/hr
   - Support blood pressure with vasoactive agents
   - Patient being broadly treated with Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin at
   this time
   - Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6H for stress dose steroids in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time.

   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presents with fever, neck pain, and facial pain after returning from a trip to [**Country 3310**]. The patient has a history of dental infections and is currently taking chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and Remicade.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Fever (101.9°F)
* Lymphadenopathy (bulky submandibular and cervical lymph nodes)
* Facial pain and swelling
* Edematous face, particularly eyelids
* Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and ABG results of //18/

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 11.8 K/μL
* Hct: 28.7%
* Plt: 197 K/μL
* Cr: 0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 144 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.7/41.6/1.1, CK/CKMB/<0.01, ALT/AST: 32/57, Alk Phos/T Bili: 132/1.2, Differential-Neuts: 91.0%, Band: 8.0%, Lymph: 0.0%, Mono: 1.0%, Eos: 0.0%, LDH: 293 IU/L, Ca++: 6.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient is currently receiving empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin, pending final CSF results. The patient is also being treated empirically for influenza with oseltamivir pending DFA results.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, neck pain, and facial pain, are concerning for meningitis. The patient's CSF and blood cryptococcal ag results are negative, but further testing is needed to rule out other pathogens.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, likely due to hypovolemia and distributive/septic physiology. The patient is being supported with fluid boluses and vasoactive agents.
* HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV status and immunosuppression due to chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and Remicade may increase the risk of opportunistic infections.
* Adult Still's disease flare: The patient's symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, and hypotension, are concerning for a flare of adult Still's disease. The patient is being treated with stress dose steroids and is awaiting rheumatology input.
* Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, and increased ferritin level, are concerning for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. However, the patient's prior diagnosis of adult Still's disease and absence of two-line cytopenia associated with HLH make it less likely.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin, pending final CSF results.
2. Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal serologies, HBV viral load, and influenza DFA results.
3. Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending that result.
4. Appreciate ID recs.
5. Consult rheumatology for assistance in management of adult Still's disease flare.
6. Trend ferritin.
7. Trend CBC and check triglycerides and fibrinogen level for HLH.
8. Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov (ATRIPLA) 600 mg-200 mg-300 mg daily.
9. Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily.
10. Hold on Remicade and methotrexate at this time.
11. Monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism.
   Presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain. Recently returned
   from [**Country 3310**].
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy:
   Concerning that patient has diagnosis of HIV (though CD4 was 288 on
   [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable) and additionally has
   immunosuppression related to chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and
   Remicade. UA was slightly positive in the ED and may contribute to
   fevers, though an underwhelming explanation of fevers up to 103 and
   facial lymphadenopathy. Patient reported to have dental infections in
   the past; however, no current evidence to suggest a dental etiology.
   Patient has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has
   experienced flares in the past during which her course has been marked
   by submental lymphadenopathy, fever, and hypotension. Meningitis seems
   unlikely to cause this degree of lymphadenopathy; further, patient's
   loss of supple neck is easily confused with an exam limited by pain
   from lymphadenopathy. Distant possibility is hemophagocytic
   lymphohistiocytosis, which would be hard to distinguish clinically from
   adult Still's disease flare given that both can present with fever,
   lymphadenopathy, increased ferritin level. Going against HLH is the
   patient's prior diagnosis of adult Still's along with abscence of
   two-line cytopenia associated with HLH.  Cryptococcal and malaria
   negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, at increased dosing for meningitis pending final CSF
   results.  Also add Flagyll today for anaerobic coverage.
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal
   serologies, HBV viral load
   - Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending
   that result
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Consult rheumatology for assistance in management of adult Still's
   flare
   -check EBV, CMV PCR
   -confirm with radiology that could view teeth or ask if they want
   panorex.
   - Trend ferritin
   #. Hypotension:
   Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia and
   distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital in
   past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on broad
   spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that time.
   - Has had good UOP, and now off pressors.  Bolus IVF to keep off if
   possible.
   - Patient being broadly treated with Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin at
   this time, adding flagyll
   - Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6H for stress dose steroids in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain after returning from a country with a high risk of infectious diseases. She has a history of immunosuppression due to chronic medication use.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Fever (101.9°F)
* Hypotension (BP: 110/58 mmHg)
* Lymphadenopathy (submandibular and cervical lymph nodes)
* Edematous face, particularly eyelids
* Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen
* Abnormal laboratory results:
	+ Elevated WBC count (11.8 K/uL)
	+ Elevated CRP (293 IU/L)
	+ Elevated LDH (293 IU/L)
	+ Abnormal electrolyte levels (e.g., potassium, magnesium)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, neck pain, and facial pain, are concerning for meningitis. However, the CSF and blood cryptococcal ag tests are negative, making bacterial meningitis a more likely possibility.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and abnormal laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Adult Still's disease flare: The patient's symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, and hypotension, are consistent with a flare of adult Still's disease.
4. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): Although less likely, HLH should be considered given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.
5. Infection: The patient's history of immunosuppression and recent travel to a country with a high risk of infectious diseases increases the risk of infection.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

1. Empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ampicillin pending final CSF results.
2. Addition of Flagyll for anaerobic coverage.
3. Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal serologies, and HBV viral load.
4. Treatment of influenza empirically with oseltamivir pending the result.
5. Consultation with rheumatology for assistance in managing adult Still's disease flare.
6. Trending of ferritin levels.
7. Continuation of Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov (ATRIPLA) for HIV management.
8. Prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily.
9. Hold on Remicade and methotrexate at this time.
10. ICU care, including nutrition, lines, and prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV  (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Feel that this is most
   consistent with Still
s flare given past presentations, but must rule
   out infection first.  Also now with positive blood cultures that worsen
   worry for infection.
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibioitics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   - Could possibly have a pericardial effusion from pericarditis from
   Still
s flare contributing to tachycardia and hypotension, will get TTE
   today which can also look for vegetations due to bacteremia
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm to assess for progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: Fever, lymphadenopathy
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.  Consider TTE in am for
   ?pericarditis/effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV  (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Feel that this is most
   consistent with Still
s flare given past presentations, but must rule
   out infection first.  Also now with positive blood cultures that worsen
   worry for infection.
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibioitics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   - Could possibly have a pericardial effusion from pericarditis from
   Still
s flare contributing to tachycardia and hypotension, will get TTE
   today which can also look for vegetations due to bacteremia
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm to assess for progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fever, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]. She has a history of chronic immunosuppression due to treatment for Still's disease and HIV. The patient's blood cultures grew GPC in clusters, and she has a positive stool culture. The patient has been treated with empiric antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, and Flagyl, and is awaiting further laboratory results, including CSF, blood cultures, and HBV viral load.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and stool culture suggest the possibility of infection, which is a significant concern given her chronic immunosuppression. The patient's fever, neck pain, and facial pain may be indicative of a bacterial or fungal infection.
2. Pericarditis/Effusion: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be related to pericarditis or effusion, which could be a complication of Still's disease or a secondary infection.
3. Lymph Node Biopsy: The patient's lymph node biopsy may be necessary to determine the cause of her lymphadenopathy and to rule out infection.
4. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of septic shock, which could be a life-threatening complication.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, may be necessary to manage her respiratory compromise.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and constipation may be indicative of gastrointestinal complications, such as inflammatory bowel disease or Clostridium difficile infection.
7. Ophthalmic Complications: The patient's facial pain and swelling may be indicative of ophthalmic complications, such as orbital cellulitis or orbital abscess.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's headache and neck pain may be indicative of neurological complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
9. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of cardiac complications, such as pericarditis or cardiomyopathy.
10. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels may be indicative of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease."

   Chief Complaint: Fever, lymphadenopathy
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Also now with positive
   blood cultures that worsen worry for infection.  Feel that she also
   likely has Still
s flare on top of an infection given past
   presentations..
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
 can likely stop
   ampicillin if CSF cultures negative x 48 hours as less likely
   meningitis
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   - Consider TTE to look for endocarditis if Staph in cultures
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm vs tomorrow morning to assess for
   progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: Fever, lymphadenopathy
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Also now with positive
   blood cultures that worsen worry for infection.  Feel that she also
   likely has Still
s flare on top of an infection given past
   presentations..
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
 can likely stop
   ampicillin if CSF cultures negative x 48 hours as less likely
   meningitis
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   - Consider TTE to look for endocarditis if Staph in cultures
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm vs tomorrow morning to assess for
   progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fever, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. She has a positive blood culture and is receiving empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, and Flagyl. The patient's condition is complicated by a possible Still's flare on top of an infection. She has a history of hypotension without a definitive cause and has presented to the hospital in the past with similar symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture and fevers suggest a possible infection. The broad differential includes infectious and rheumatologic causes, and the patient's chronic immunosuppression due to treatment for Still's disease and HIV makes her more susceptible to infection.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be related to septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's positive blood culture and possible Still's flare make endocarditis a possible complication.
4. Lymph Node Biopsy: The patient's lymphadenopathy and possible Still's flare may require a lymph node biopsy to determine the cause of the inflammation.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression and recent steroid use may increase her risk of adrenal insufficiency, which requires close monitoring.
6. Throat Edema: The patient's throat edema and possible Still's flare may require close monitoring and treatment to prevent airway compromise.
7. HIV-Related Complications: The patient's HIV infection may increase her risk of other complications, such as opportunistic infections or malignancies.
8. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which requires close monitoring and treatment.
9. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen may indicate renal dysfunction, which requires close monitoring and treatment.
10. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory symptoms and possible Still's flare may increase her risk of respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and treatment."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.  Consider TTE in am for
   ?pericarditis/effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV  (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Feel that this is most
   consistent with Still
s flare given past presentations, but must rule
   out infection first.  Also now with positive blood cultures that worsen
   worry for infection.
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibioitics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   - Could possibly have a pericardial effusion from pericarditis from
   Still
s flare contributing to tachycardia and hypotension, will get TTE
   today which can also look for vegetations due to bacteremia
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm to assess for progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.  Consider TTE in am for
   ?pericarditis/effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV  (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Feel that this is most
   consistent with Still
s flare given past presentations, but must rule
   out infection first.  Also now with positive blood cultures that worsen
   worry for infection.
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibioitics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   - Could possibly have a pericardial effusion from pericarditis from
   Still
s flare contributing to tachycardia and hypotension, will get TTE
   today which can also look for vegetations due to bacteremia
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm to assess for progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

   Disposition: ICU for now given throat edema<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]. The patient's condition is complex, and the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures, and the differential diagnosis includes infectious vs. rheumatologic causes. The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, organ failure, and death due to chronic immunosuppression.
2. Pericarditis/Effusion: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be related to pericarditis or effusion, which could be caused by Still's flare or infection. A TTE today will help evaluate this possibility.
3. Lymph Node Biopsy: The patient's lymphadenopathy may require a biopsy to rule out lymphoma or other conditions. The patient's chronic immunosuppression increases the risk of opportunistic infections.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bowel regimen includes miralax and senna, which may not be effective in managing constipation. The patient may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's throat edema and lymphadenopathy may compromise her airway. The patient may require intubation or tracheotomy if her condition worsens.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be related to sepsis, pericarditis, or effusion. The patient may require vasopressors or inotropes to maintain blood pressure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's fever, headache, and confusion may be related to meningitis, encephalitis, or sepsis. The patient may require neurological consultation and imaging studies to evaluate these possibilities.
8. Ophthalmic Complications: The patient's facial pain and swelling may be related to orbital cellulitis or other ophthalmic complications. The patient may require ophthalmic consultation and imaging studies to evaluate these possibilities.
9. Renal Complications: The patient's hypotension and sepsis may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. The patient may require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
10. Hematological Complications: The patient's chronic immunosuppression may lead to bone marrow suppression, anemia, or bleeding diathesis. The patient may require blood transfusions or platelet infusions.

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent and treat these potential complications. The patient's condition requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving infectious disease, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology, and neurology consultants."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fever, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is currently receiving fluids and stress steroids. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/48 mmHg. She has a C-reactive protein of 106 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein elevation suggest the possibility of sepsis. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be related to sepsis or distributive shock.
2. Infection: The patient's recent trip to [**Country 3310**] and her presentation with fever, neck pain, and facial pain suggest the possibility of an infection. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis and an elevated C-reactive protein, which may indicate an infection.
3. Adult-onset Still's disease: The patient's history of adult-onset Still's disease and her presentation with fever, neck pain, and facial pain suggest the possibility of a flare-up of the disease.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may contribute to her symptoms, particularly her fatigue and weakness.
5. HIV: The patient's history of HIV and her current treatment with antiretroviral medications may affect her immune system and increase her risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea may be related to her antibiotics or an underlying infection.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may be related to her underlying lung disease or an infection.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be related to sepsis or distributive shock.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be related to her underlying medical conditions or an infection.
10. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate kidney dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress steroids.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis or infection.
3. Consider performing a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis.
4. Continue antiretroviral medications and prophylactic medications for HIV.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and consider performing a gastrointestinal evaluation.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory symptoms and consider performing a respiratory evaluation.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular symptoms and consider performing a cardiovascular evaluation.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological symptoms and consider performing a neurological evaluation.
9. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider performing a renal evaluation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis and hypotension. They have a history of Still's disease and are currently being treated with steroids. The patient has developed laryngeal edema, and there is concern about the possibility of Stills flair. They have been experiencing tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis, and have undergone several rounds of antibiotic therapy.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 92 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 101/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* No acute distress
* Overweight/obese
* Cervical lymph nodes are normal
* Submental and neck swelling with mild tenderness
* Cardiovascular examination is normal
* Respiratory examination is clear
* Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender
* Extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities
* Skin examination is normal, with a facial rash that is stable
* Neurological examination is normal

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.8-17.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 197-190 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 10 mg/dL
* Glucose: 144-161 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
2. Stills flare: The patient's history of Still's disease and current symptoms suggest the possibility of a flare, which can lead to worsening of the patient's condition if not managed promptly.
3. Infection: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an infection, which can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and SpO2 suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
5. Cardiac failure: The patient's blood pressure and cardiac examination suggest the possibility of cardiac failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination suggests the possibility of neurological complications, such as sepsis-related encephalopathy or stroke, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and abdominal examination suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly."

   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Also now with positive
   blood cultures that worsen worry for infection.  Feel that she also
   likely has Still
s flare on top of an infection given past
   presentations..
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage), have decreased dose of ceftriaxone
   per ID recs
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin daily
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF as needed
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today to assess for progression/resolution
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. She has a history of chronic immunosuppression due to treatment for Still's disease and diagnosis of HIV. Her current presentation suggests a possible infection and Still's disease flare. She has positive blood cultures and is being treated with empiric antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated CRP suggest a high risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death if not promptly treated.
2. Still's disease flare: The patient's symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, and joint pain, are consistent with a Still's disease flare. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to joint damage, disability, and increased morbidity.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial and may be due to hypovolemia, distributive/septic physiology, and adrenal axis suppression. If not managed promptly, this could lead to organ failure, shock, and death.
4. Throat edema and lymphadenopathy: The patient's significant swelling in her throat and lymph nodes may be a sign of a more severe infection or allergic reaction. If not managed promptly, this could lead to airway compromise, respiratory failure, and death.
5. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may be contributing to her current symptoms and complications. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to increased morbidity and mortality.
6. Adrenal axis suppression: The patient's chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression may be contributing to her hypotension and other symptoms. If not managed promptly, this could lead to adrenal crisis, which can be life-threatening.
7. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is compromised, with a positive fluid balance and oliguria. If not managed promptly, this could lead to electrolyte imbalances, organ failure, and death.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support is compromised, with a high oxygen requirement and possible respiratory failure. If not managed promptly, this could lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
2. Manage the patient's hypotension with fluid boluses and vasopressors as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's throat edema and lymphadenopathy closely and consider repeating CT scans to assess for progression or resolution.
4. Continue HIV treatment and prophylaxis as prescribed.
5. Manage the patient's Still's disease flare with corticosteroids and rheumatology input.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels closely and adjust fluid management as needed.
7. Consider performing a lymph node biopsy if the patient's symptoms do not improve.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
9. Consider performing a TTE to assess for cardiac dysfunction.
10. Monitor the patient's ferritin levels daily and consider transfusing if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Also now with positive
   blood cultures that worsen worry for infection.  Feel that she also
   likely has Still

   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF as needed

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. She has been diagnosed with coagulase-negative staphylococcus bacteremia and has a positive blood culture. She is being treated with empiric antibiotics and has been started on solumedrol for chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression. Her condition is being closely monitored, and she is receiving fluids and oxygen as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and positive blood culture increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Infection: The patient's chronic immunosuppression due to treatment for Still's disease and diagnosis of HIV increases the risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression increases the risk of adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension and shock.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can exacerbate her symptoms and increase the risk of complications, particularly if not adequately treated.
5. Still's Disease Flare: The patient's presentation may be a flare of her Still's disease, which can lead to joint pain and swelling, fever, and other systemic symptoms.
6. Lymphadenopathy: The patient's lymphadenopathy can increase the risk of infection and lymphoma.
7. HIV-Related Complications: The patient's HIV infection can increase the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and other complications, such as HIV-related cardiomyopathy and nephropathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust antibiotic treatment as necessary.
3. Continue solumedrol for chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression.
4. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider lymph node biopsy if the patient's lymphadenopathy does not improve.
6. Monitor the patient's HIV viral load and CD4 count and adjust antiretroviral therapy as necessary.
7. Consider stress dose steroids in the setting of sepsis or adrenal insufficiency.
8. Monitor the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
9. Consider prophylactic antibiotics for the patient's indwelling catheters and lines.
10. Monitor the patient's pain and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fever, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of shock and hypotension. The patient's condition has been stable off pressors, and her laboratory results show evidence of inflammation, including elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and ferritin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation is consistent with sepsis, and her laboratory results show evidence of an inflammatory response. She requires continued empiric antibiotic therapy tailored to the suspected infectious process.
2. Adult-Onset Still's Disease: The patient's symptoms may be related to a flare of her underlying rheumatologic disease. She requires continued steroid therapy and rheumatologic follow-up.
3. HIV: The patient's HIV status should be managed with antiretroviral therapy and home prophylactic medications.
4. Infectious Process: The patient's symptoms may be related to an infectious process, such as cellulitis or abscess, and she requires further evaluation and management.
5. Lymphoma: The patient's symptoms may be related to lymphoma, and she requires further evaluation and management.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's echocardiogram shows evidence of left atrial dilation, which may be related to her underlying cardiac condition.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and she requires careful monitoring to prevent renal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotic therapy tailored to the suspected infectious process.
2. Continue steroid therapy for the patient's adult-onset Still's disease.
3. Manage the patient's HIV status with antiretroviral therapy and home prophylactic medications.
4. Further evaluate and manage the patient's symptoms to determine the underlying cause.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac and respiratory status closely.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and renal function closely.
7. Consider further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan, to evaluate the patient's symptoms and underlying condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   49F with PMH HIV, recent CD5 288, adult-onset Stills disease and
   hypothyroidism who presents with fever, neck pain, facial pain and
   hypotension after recent trip to [**Country 3310**].  Remains unclear [**Name2 (NI) 12301**]
   presentation is c/w Stills falre vs infection/sepsis. We continue to
   cover empirically.
   # Fever/ LAD/ leukocytosis: broad ddx discussed. Includes rheumatologic
   disease/ Stills, lymphoma given focality infection (oral
   infection/cellulitis/abscess)
   -- Continue empiric antibx  ( vanc/ceftriaxone /flagyl)
   -- ID, rheum, and ent input appreciated
   -- Repeat ct neck to follow soft tissue process--? Indication for FNA
   Follow pending serologies
   # Hypotension: resolved
   # tachyardia
improved with fluids and resolution of fever
   #Stills Disease
   - presentation may all represent flare of  rheumatologic disease, on
   steroids
   - trend ferritin, rheum labs pending, rheum following

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fever, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]. The patient remains unclear about the presentation, which is consistent with either Still's disease flare or infection/sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 96 bpm, blood pressure 138/85 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 11 mmHg, and total fluid intake of 5,070 mL, with a balance of 880 mL.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 100%.
* Physical examination: Well-nourished, with slight improvement in periorbital edema and submental edema. Cardiovascular examination is normal, with clear breath sounds and no evidence of respiratory distress.
* Lab results: Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, white blood cell count 11.8 K/uL, platelet count 194 K/uL, and troponin-T <0.01 ng/mL. Other lab results include elevated levels of ALT, AST, and LDH, with a normal calcium level.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
* ID, rheum, and ent input appreciated.
* Repeat CT neck to follow soft tissue process and consider FNA.
* Follow pending serologies.
* Continue antiretroviral therapy and home prophylactic medications for HIV.
* ICU care includes nutrition via PO diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or infection, particularly given the patient's history of HIV and recent travel to [**Country 3310**].
* Respiratory failure or distress, particularly given the patient's history of hypotension and tachypnea.
* Cardiovascular complications, particularly given the patient's history of hypotension and tachycardia.
* Neurological complications, particularly given the patient's history of HIV and recent travel to [**Country 3310**].
* Renal failure or worsening of liver function, particularly given the patient's elevated levels of ALT, AST, and LDH.
* Gastrointestinal complications, particularly given the patient's history of HIV and recent travel to [**Country 3310**].

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's overall well-being."
