   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin
   SS
   .
   9. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, disordered breathing, and recurrent chest pain. He was found to have stent thrombosis and underwent emergency catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He was started on invasive ventilation and received dopamine for shock. He was also found to have atrial fibrillation, likely related to dopamine and other medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/55 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 91% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Myocardial infarction: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial infarction. This could lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to further cardiac complications, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, or heart failure.
3. Shock: The patient's hypotension could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 91%, which is below the normal range. This could lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
5. Disordered breathing: The patient's history of disordered breathing and CVA could lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's history of stroke and CVA could increase his risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy could increase his risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding.
8. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac catheterization and PCI could increase his risk of cardiac tamponade, particularly if there is a perforation of the coronary artery or ventricle.
9. Renal failure: The patient's history of CVA and hypertension could increase his risk of renal failure, particularly if he experiences further cardiac or respiratory complications.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and anticoagulation therapy could increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if he experiences further cardiac or respiratory complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin
   SS
   .
   9. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, T2DM, and HTN, admitted with recurrent chest pain and stent thrombosis. He underwent emergency catheterization and PCI with export of thrombus and POBA. He is currently in the ICU with ongoing treatment for shock, atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, and hypothyroidism. His condition is complicated by history of CVA, disordered breathing, and emphysema/ILD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Myocardial stunning leading to ongoing shock and hypotension
	* Atrial fibrillation may lead to thromboembolic events, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism
	* Cardiac failure may worsen due to stent thrombosis and ongoing hypotension
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hypoxia may worsen due to underlying emphysema/ILD and disordered breathing
	* Pneumonia or VAP may develop due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive ventilation
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury may worsen due to hypotension and ongoing treatment with nephrotoxic medications
	* Chronic kidney disease may progress due to underlying conditions and medications
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack may occur due to atrial fibrillation and underlying CVA
	* Seizures may develop due to electrolyte imbalances and medication side effects
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis may develop due to underlying infections or invasive devices
	* Pneumonia or VAP may occur due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive ventilation
6. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia may worsen due to underlying T2DM and stress response
	* Electrolyte imbalances may develop due to ongoing treatment with medications and fluids

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further complications and optimize outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin
   SS
   .
   9. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male, is a complex case with a history of CVA, 3-vessel disease, and stent thrombosis. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and disordered breathing. The patient underwent cardioversion and defibrillation, and was weaned off dopamine. He is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, hypoxia, and chest pain. His laboratory results show elevated troponin-T and CK levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction or stunning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Myocardial infarction or stunning due to stent thrombosis
	* Atrial fibrillation may lead to stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrest
	* Hypotension due to decreased cardiac output
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hypoxia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema
	* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory infections
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to atrial fibrillation or other underlying conditions
	* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia due to anticoagulation therapy or other underlying conditions
	* Increased risk of bleeding due to low platelet count
5. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus and inadequate insulin therapy
	* Dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid loss

Recommendations:

1. Continue aspirin and Plavix to prevent further cardiac events.
2. Restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves to manage hypertension.
3. Continue insulin therapy to manage diabetes mellitus.
4. Monitor troponin-T and CK levels to assess for possible myocardial infarction or stunning.
5. Monitor blood pressure and cardiac rhythm to detect any changes or complications.
6. Consider Holter monitoring to assess for atrial fibrillation and its impact on the patient's condition.
7. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of stroke or TIA and consider imaging studies to assess for cerebral vasculature.

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in [**2-14**]),
   T2DM, and CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing  was admitted with
   recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   2. Shock
   Patient
s BP has now improved off dopamine and now back in sinus
   rhythm.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient developed new finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post
   resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. He
   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   6. HTN -
   - continue ACEI and BB
   7. Type 2 diabetes
   Hold metformin while in house, continue insulin SS
   8. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p stent placement, T2DM, and CVA. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and was found to have stent thrombosis. He underwent emergency cath lab procedure, export of thrombus, and POBA. He was started on aspirin, high-dose Plavix, and beta blocker, and is being weaned off dopamine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg. He is in sinus rhythm and has a respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. He has a 3cm x 3cm hematoma and ecchymoses in the right groin and a clean dressing in the left groin. His neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.7, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 181 K/uL. His troponin-T level is 7.90, and his creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue aspirin, high-dose Plavix, and beta blocker
* Restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine
* Continue telemetry
* Continue Flovent 220 and spiriva
* Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
* Follow up with Pulmonary as outpatient, evaluate for home O2
* Continue Plavix
* Continue ACEI and BB
* Hold metformin while in house, continue insulin SS
* Continue synthroid

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Stent thrombosis
* Atrial fibrillation
* Hypoxia
* Shock
* Disordered breathing
* CVA
* HTN
* Type 2 diabetes
* Hypothyroidism

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission following a cardioversion/defibrillation procedure. The patient has been weaned off dopamine and is currently receiving propofol and hydromorphone for sedation and pain management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 181 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 19.7
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 7.90 ng/mL
* TCO2: 19 mmHg
* Glucose: 291 mg/dL
* Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's unstable condition, but the patient is responding to verbal commands and has a normal sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to the patient's tachypnea and possible pneumonia
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's recent cardioversion/defibrillation procedure and underlying coronary artery disease
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy
* Infection due to the patient's prolonged hospital stay and possible catheter-related infections
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and possible gastrointestinal bleeding

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing, T2DM
   was admitted with recurrent chest pain after previous admission 2 weeks
   ago with 3 vessel disease s/p DES to RCA and found to have stent
   thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin and plavix
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   - trend CK to peak
   2. Shock
   Patient was continued on dopamine overnight, likely related to
   myocardial stunning.
   - try to wean dopamine as tolerated for goal MAP of 60
   - re-echo on discharge.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   New finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post resuscitation and
   related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine.
   - try to wean dopamine and see if atrial fibrillation converts
   - if he doesn't auto-convert, will do cardioversion while in unit.
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   6. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix
   7. HTN -
   - restart lisinopril and metoprolol once BP improves
   8. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, continue insulin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, 3-vessel disease, and stent thrombosis. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and was found to have stent thrombosis. He underwent export of thrombus and POBA in the cath lab.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: He is in sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, and a blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg.
* Respiratory: He is on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with a saturation of 97%.
* Neurological: He is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 19.7, Hct 32.5, Plt 197
	+ Electrolytes: Na 140, K 3.8, Cl 110, Ca 8.3, Mg 1.7, PO4 3.1
	+ Renal function: Cr 1.2, TCO2 19
	+ Liver function: ALT 44, AST 139, Alk Phos 80, T Bili 0.9
	+ Troponin-T: 7.90
	+ CK/CKMB: 330/21

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of stent thrombosis and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, including stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of disordered breathing and emphysema puts him at risk for respiratory failure, pneumonia, and respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and stroke puts him at risk for recurrent strokes, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism puts him at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including diabetic gastroparesis and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's history of chronic illnesses and hospitalization puts him at risk for hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of anticoagulation therapy and bleeding complications puts him at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and intracranial bleeding.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in [**2-14**]),
   T2DM, and CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing  was admitted with
   recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   2. Shock
   Patient
s BP has now improved off dopamine and now back in sinus
   rhythm.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient developed new finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post
   resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. He
   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with a history of CAD, T2DM, CVA, and HTN, admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. The patient underwent emergency stent thrombosis treatment and was taken to the cath lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac damage. The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to the use of aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage.

The patient's medical history is significant for CVA, HTN, and T2DM, which may increase the risk of complications such as bleeding, kidney damage, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Kidney damage: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate potential kidney damage.
4. Infection: The patient has a central line and may be at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of disordered breathing and may be at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving prophylactic stress ulcer medication, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of CVA and may be at risk for further neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.

The patient's plan of care includes continued aspirin, high-dose clopidogrel, and beta blocker therapy, as well as restarting lisinopril once the patient is weaned off dopamine. The patient will also continue to receive oxygen therapy and telemetry monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old male admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. He underwent emergency catheterization and thrombus export, followed by POBA. He has a history of CAD, T2DM, CVA, and disordered breathing. Current issues include:

* Shock, which has improved off dopamine and in sinus rhythm
* Atrial fibrillation, which was cardioverted and patient is now in sinus rhythm
* Hypoxia, with a history of disordered breathing and evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT
* History of CVA, which has caused complex disordered breathing
* HTN, managed with ACEI and BB
* Type 2 diabetes, managed with insulin SS and holding metformin in house
* Hypothyroidism, managed with synthroid

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Progressive left ventricular systolic dysfunction
	+ Mitral regurgitation
	+ Atrial fibrillation
* Pulmonary complications:
	+ Hypoxia
	+ Progression of emphysema and ILD
* Neurological complications:
	+ History of CVA, with potential for further complications
* Endocrine complications:
	+ Type 2 diabetes, with potential for further complications
	+ Hypothyroidism, with potential for further complications
* Thrombotic complications:
	+ Stent thrombosis, with potential for further thrombotic events
	+ DVT prophylaxis with heparin sodium

It is essential to monitor the patient's cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological status closely to prevent further complications and ensure optimal management of his conditions."

   89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in [**2-14**]),
   T2DM, and CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing  was admitted with
   recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restart lisinopril once weaned off dopamine.
   2. Shock
   Patient
s BP has now improved off dopamine and now back in sinus
   rhythm.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient developed new finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post
   resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. He
   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old male with a history of CAD, T2DM, and CVA, admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. He underwent export of thrombus and POBA in the cath lab. His current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: He has worsening wall motion with an EF of 50%, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/hypokinesis in the basal to mid-inferior/inferolateral segments.
* Respiratory: He has a history of disordered breathing following stroke and has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT. He is currently on O2 NC to maintain a sat >88%.
* Hemodynamic: His BP has improved off dopamine, and he is in sinus rhythm.
* Neurological: He has a history of CVA, and his stroke has caused complex disordered breathing.
* Laboratory: His lab results show mild anemia, elevated troponin-T, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac: The patient's worsening cardiac function, including decreased EF and regional wall motion abnormalities, increases the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory: The patient's history of disordered breathing and evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT increase the risk of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Hemodynamic: The patient's history of shock and hypotension increases the risk of further hemodynamic instability and cardiac complications.
4. Neurological: The patient's history of CVA and complex disordered breathing increases the risk of further neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, and cognitive decline.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive lines and devices increase the risk of infection, including VAP and DVT.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests increase the risk of liver failure and bleeding complications.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's history of T2DM and use of insulin increase the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and consider further interventions to improve cardiac function.
2. Continue respiratory support and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation.
3. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust therapy as needed to maintain adequate perfusion.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further interventions to improve neurological function.
5. Implement strategies to prevent infection, including proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, and administration of antibiotics as indicated.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function closely and consider further interventions to improve liver function.
7. Monitor the patient's metabolic status closely and adjust therapy as needed to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical with ongoing myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and interstitial lung disease. The patient's left ventricular function has worsened, with an estimated ejection fraction of 50%, indicating a significant decline in cardiac function.

The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg and a heart rate of 73 bpm. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate ongoing cardiac injury, with elevated troponin-T levels and decreased hemoglobin levels. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels, indicating possible liver injury.

The patient's imaging studies, including the trans-thoracic echo, show worsening left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and right ventricular dilatation. The patient's coronary arteries are likely occluded, leading to ongoing myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's worsening left ventricular function and ongoing myocardial infarction, there is a high risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's declining left ventricular function increases the risk of developing cardiac failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Sepsis: The patient's interstitial lung disease and ongoing cardiac injury increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's interstitial lung disease and possible pneumonia increase the risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and decreased lung compliance.
5. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and possible liver injury increase the risk of developing liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and increased mortality.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management in the ICU, with a focus on optimizing cardiac function, managing respiratory status, and preventing sepsis and liver failure."

   [**3-15**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular
   cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with basal to mid inferior/inferolateral
   akinesis/hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
   normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
   valve chordae. Mild to moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-3-3**], the
   inferior/inferolateral regional wall motion abnormalities are now more
   severe. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
   Mitral regurgitation is now less prominent.
   89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in [**2-14**]),

   1. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restarted lisinopril
   1.5. Cardiac rub new today.  Ddx includes post MI pericarditis; less
   likely contained RV rupture.  Echo ok yesterday.

   Patient
s BP has now improved off dopamine and now back in sinus
   rhythm.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient developed new finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post

   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia.  Improved.  On minimal oxygen.
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Pt will follow up with Pulmonary ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4305**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2721**]) as outpatient, eval
   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 89-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who was admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. He underwent emergency stenting and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 60% to 50% on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The TTE also showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets.

The patient has developed new cardiac rub, which is concerning for post-myocardial infarction (MI) pericarditis or contained right ventricular (RV) rupture. He is being treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine, and is being monitored closely.

The patient has also developed atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is likely related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine used during resuscitation. He has been cardioverted and is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has a history of disordered breathing following his stroke, and has evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease (ILD) on chest computed tomography (CT). He is being treated with Flovent and Spiriva, and is being monitored for hypoxia.

The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypothyroidism, which are being managed with medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Post-MI pericarditis
	* Contained RV rupture
	* Atrial fibrillation-related stroke
	* Heart failure
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Hypoxia
	* Respiratory failure
	* Pneumonia
3. Metabolic complications:
	* Hyperglycemia
	* Hypoglycemia
4. Neurological complications:
	* Stroke
	* Seizures
5. Infection-related complications:
	* Sepsis
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

The patient's disposition is currently in the coronary care unit (CCU), and will be discussed further with the care team."

   A/P: 89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in
   [**2-14**]), T2DM, and CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing  was admitted
   with recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   RCA STEMI/Instent thrombosis x2: New RCA infarct overnight, s/p
   emergent cath and stent to RCA proximal to where other stents had been.
   Etiology unclear as patient was on double dose of Plavix. ? Plavix
   resistance. Cardiac rub more prominent today  Ddx includes post MI
   pericarditis; less likely contained RV rupture.
   - post cath check at noon
   - continue heparin gtt
   - hematology consult for recurring stent
   - trend Cardaic Enzymes for peak, monitor EKG
   - levophed pressors for MAP>60
   - try to wean dopamine first as it causes more coronary
   vasoconstriction than levophed
   - repeat ECHO to evaluate for systolic function
   - 150mg plavix daily, aspirin 325mg
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient developed atrial fibrillation, likely post
   resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine during
   first STEMI. He has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on
   [**2146-3-14**] until 6pm on [**3-16**].  When he went to cath, cardioversion was
   attempted but was unsuccessful. Currently rate controlled.
   - on heparin post cath

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 89-year-old male admitted with recurrent chest pain and found to have stent thrombosis. He had a previous history of CAD, T2DM, and CVA. He developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and was treated with dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine during the first STEMI. He had a new RCA occlusion, and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with RV infarct and cardiogenic shock. He had poor urine output throughout the day and was given increments of boluses until 1L. He developed AF again at 6pm, with a heart rate of 100-120bpm and hypotension to SBP 80s. He was treated with dopamine and levophed, and his blood pressure was stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely due to RV infarct and cardiogenic shock. He needs preload and vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF is likely post-resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine during the first STEMI. He needs rate control and consideration for cardioversion.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to cardiogenic shock and AF. He needs preload and vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to post-cath hct drop and active T+S. He needs to be transfused for hct <25.
5. Chest wall pain: The patient's chest wall pain is likely due to CPR with Vfib arrest on the first STEMI. He needs pain control with Tylenol for now, as he is afraid of analgesia with a drop in pressure.
6. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to his history of emphysema and ILD. He needs to continue Flovent and Spiriva, and O2 NC to maintain a saturation of >88%.
7. CVA: The patient's CVA has caused complex disordered breathing, and he has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient.
8. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes is likely uncontrolled, and he needs to continue insulin SS and hold metformin while in the hospital.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism needs to be continued with synthroid.
10. Stent thrombosis: The patient's stent thrombosis is likely due to Plavix resistance. He needs to continue Plavix and aspirin 325mg.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin gtt and monitor for bleeding.
2. Trend cardiac enzymes for peak and monitor EKG.
3. Wean dopamine and levophed to maintain a blood pressure of >60mmHg.
4. Repeat ECHO to evaluate for systolic function.
5. Continue amiodarone load and IV drip for rate control.
6. Consider another attempt at cardioversion if amiodarone does not work.
7. Continue insulin SS and hold metformin while in the hospital.
8. Continue synthroid for hypothyroidism.
9. Continue Plavix and aspirin 325mg.
10. Monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted with recurrent chest pain, found to have stent thrombosis, and underwent emergent catheterization and stenting. He developed atrial fibrillation, likely post-resuscitation, and has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion. He also has a history of CAD, T2DM, and CVA, with evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 105 bpm (45-116 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 78/43 mmHg (73-109/62-93 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (15-27 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 93%
* Weight: 79.2 kg (admission weight: 70 kg)

Lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.8%
* Platelet count: 219 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 15.7 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.97 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Shock: The patient's blood pressure has improved, but he remains on dopamine and norepinephrine infusions. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent further hypotension.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, but cardioversion or amiodarone load may be necessary for rhythm control. Telemetry monitoring is ongoing.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit have dropped, and transfusion may be necessary to maintain a hemoglobin level of <25.
4. Chest pain: The patient has a new cardiac rub, which may be due to post-MI pericarditis or contained RV rupture. Close monitoring and consideration of NSAIDs or colchicine are necessary.
5. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of disordered breathing and emphysema, and may require ongoing oxygen therapy.
6. History of CVA: The patient's stroke has caused complex disordered breathing, and he has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient.
7. HTN: The patient is on ACEI and beta blockers, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored.
8. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and he is receiving insulin therapy.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on synthroid therapy.

ICU care plan:

* Nutrition: The patient's nutrition plan includes glycemic control and prophylaxis for stress ulcer and VAP.
* Lines: The patient has an 18-gauge line for central venous access.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Code status: The patient's code status is full code.
* Disposition: The patient is to be transferred to the CCU for further care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p stent placement, T2DM, and CVA. He was admitted with recurrent chest pain and was found to have stent thrombosis.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and poor urine output. He has had a recent cardiac catheterization and stent placement to the RCA, which was occluded. He is currently receiving dopamine and levophed pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg.

The patient has a history of anemia, which has worsened post-catheterization, and is being transfused. He also has a history of disordered breathing following his stroke, which is being managed with minimal oxygen therapy.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and his troponin-T is 7.90 ng/mL, indicating ongoing cardiac injury. His lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L, which is elevated, indicating potential tissue hypoxia.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, s/p stent placement, and ongoing atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and need for pressors to maintain a MAP of 60 mmHg indicate a risk of further hemodynamic instability, including hypotension and cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's history of CVA and recent cardiac catheterization increases his risk of developing an infection, including sepsis and endocarditis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of disordered breathing following his stroke and ongoing atrial fibrillation increases his risk of developing respiratory failure, including respiratory arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of anemia and ongoing hypotension increases his risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and ongoing atrial fibrillation increases his risk of developing neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk patient with multiple comorbidities and ongoing cardiac and hemodynamic instability. He requires close monitoring and management of his cardiac and hemodynamic status, as well as ongoing management of his respiratory, renal, and neurological status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone cardiac catheterization with stenting.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is in atrial fibrillation (AF) with a heart rate of 105 beats per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 78/43 mmHg.
* He is receiving dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to support his blood pressure.
* He has a new junctional rhythm and is experiencing hypotension.
* He has a guaiac-positive stool, which is being sent for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) testing.
* He has a history of thrombocytopenia and is receiving heparin prophylaxis.
* He has a weight loss of 9.2 kg since admission and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 15.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 219 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 2.97 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications are as follows:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's AF and junctional rhythm may be a sign of cardiac instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's hypotension and respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute (IPM) may indicate respiratory distress or failure.
* Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL may indicate renal insufficiency or failure.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's guaiac-positive stool and history of thrombocytopenia may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or other gastrointestinal complications.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli may indicate neurological compromise or injury.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuous monitoring of his vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
* Administration of dopamine and norepinephrine infusions to support his blood pressure.
* Monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation.
* Management of his gastrointestinal symptoms and potential complications.
* Monitoring of his renal function and potential complications.
* Monitoring of his neurological status and potential complications.
* Continuation of his cardiac medications and anticoagulation therapy.
* Consideration of further cardiac interventions, such as coronary angiography or stenting."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, interstitial lung disease, and knowledge deficit. He has been experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. His initial EKG showed atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rate of 100-120 beats per minute (bpm). He was given atropine and heparin, and his blood pressure (BP) was stabilized.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient's condition deteriorated, with his BP dropping to 78/43 mmHg and his heart rate (HR) increasing to 105 bpm. He developed a new junctional rhythm and became unresponsive for minutes. A repeat EKG showed new ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.

The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a new occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) was found. A stent was placed, and the patient was given dopamine and levophed to stabilize his BP.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin and CK-MB levels, indicating myocardial infarction. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, indicating acidosis. His white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, and his platelet count (PLT) is decreased.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and new junctional rhythm increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin and CK-MB levels indicate myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac dysfunction and death.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and decreased PLT count increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's acidosis and decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2) increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's decreased blood pressure and acidosis increase the risk of kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) increase the risk of liver dysfunction, which can lead to liver failure and death.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's decreased Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and decreased motor function increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results closely to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   A/P: 89yo male with history of CAD s/p stent placement (DES to RCA in
   [**2-14**]), T2DM, and CVA in [**2143**] with disordered breathing  was admitted
   with recurrent chest pain admission and found to have stent thrombosis.
   #RCA STEMI: New RCA infarct overnight, s/p cath and stent to RCA
   -post cath check at noon
   #. Chest Pain
   Patient found to have stent thrombosis and taken emergently to the cath
   lab where he underwent export of thrombus and POBA.
   - continue aspirin, high dose plavix, and beta blocker
   - restarted lisinopril
   1.5. Cardiac rub new today.  Ddx includes post MI pericarditis; less
   likely contained RV rupture.  Echo ok yesterday.
   - ekg today
   - NSAIDs, consider colchicine if no improvement
   - monitor closely
   2. Shock
   Patient
s BP has now improved off dopamine and now back in sinus
   rhythm.
   3. Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient developed new finding of atrial fibrillation, likely post
   resuscitation and related to dopamine, epinephrine, and atropine. He
   has remained in sinus rhythm after cardioversion on [**2146-3-14**].
   - continue telemetry
   4. Hypoxia.  Improved.  On minimal oxygen.
   Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke (usually on
   CPAP) and also has evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on
   Chest CT. Appears euvolemic.
   - continue Flovent 220 [**Hospital1 7**], and spiriva.
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%

   for home O2
   5. History of CVA
   Patient has had a stroke in the past, unclear if this was related to a
   previous episode of atrial fibrillation. His stroke has caused complex
   disordered breathing - pt has refused further treatment with CPAP or
   home O2 as outpatient
   - continue plavix

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male admitted with recurrent chest pain, found to have stent thrombosis, and underwent emergency catheterization and stenting. He has a history of CAD, T2DM, and CVA.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and bradycardia. He has been treated with dopamine, levophed, and atropine to manage his cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.

The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a history of disordered breathing following his stroke and evidence of progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of a cardiac rub on his chest X-ray increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and the presence of a new RCA occlusion on his catheterization report suggest that he may have had a myocardial infarction, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function and the presence of elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of renal failure, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of disordered breathing and the presence of emphysema and ILD on his Chest CT increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.
5. Sepsis: The patient's positive stool guaiac test and the presence of a urinary tract infection increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that he receive close monitoring and treatment for his cardiac, renal, and respiratory complications."
