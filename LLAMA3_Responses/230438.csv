    - tylenol < 2g to control fevers
   # Abdominal Pain: epigastric pain and tense, diffusely tender abdomen,
   no rebound, +/- guarding, with watery diarrhea nonbloody and with
   elevated t bili and elevated lactate but low alk phos, no
   transaminitis, normal lipase. ct abd with enlarged gallbladder but no
   e/o cholecystitis but mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, ? AIDS
   cholangiopathy. possibly known complication of truvada with lactic
   acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis. unlikely pancreatitis

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events notable for cholecystostomy tube placement with resolution of
   abdominal pain, continued fever to 101.  Episode of chest pain with no
   ekg changes, resolved.  Weaning levophed gtt.
   BP 102/50s, P80 Sat 95% on RA.  I/O:24h +6.5  This AM -700.  Chole tube
   drainaged
   Exam notable for >3+ LE edema, erythema, diffuse, unchanged.  Abd soft
   +BS.  L chest wall tenderness.  CTA B/L RRR S1 S2.
   Labs notable for 10.6 <- 7.5 / Hct 35 <- 39 / Plt 213. 17% bands.
   Cr 1.2 <- 1.4, Bicarb 22.
   Vanc trough 9.3
   Meds include: Vanc / Zosyn, truvada, kaletra, PRN dilaudid.
   45M h/o HIV, Kaposi
s sarcoma / lymphoma felt to be in remission with
   ongoing lymphedema, septic shock and pressors d/t cholecystitis, s/p
   perc chole tube.  Improving.
   Agree with plan to continue antibiotics and chole tube drainage,
   continuing on HAART per ID.  Remains on both Vanc / Zosyn for concern
   of celluitis in addition to cholecystitis, reasonable to continue for
   now awaiting final cx data.  Weaning pressors, consider further fluid
   bolus PRN.  Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill: CC time  35 min.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV, Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma, currently on treatment with HAART. He was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, acute on chronic LE edema, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's condition has been complicated by neutropenic fever, hypotension, and abdominal pain.

The patient has undergone cholecystostomy tube placement, which has resolved his abdominal pain, but he continues to have a fever. He has also experienced an episode of chest pain, which resolved on its own. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and hypoalbuminemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a severe infection.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's abdominal pain, elevated liver enzymes, and cholecystostomy tube placement suggest the possibility of cholangitis, which is a life-threatening complication of biliary tract infection.
3. AIDS cholangiopathy: The patient's history of HIV and his current symptoms, including abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes, suggest the possibility of AIDS cholangiopathy, a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the bile ducts.
4. Neutropenic fever: The patient's neutropenic fever is a serious complication that can lead to sepsis and death. The patient's low white blood cell count and elevated band count suggest a severe infection.
5. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hypoalbuminemia suggest the possibility of liver failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and chest pain suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, including myocarditis or cardiac tamponade.
7. Infections: The patient's neutropenic fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections.
8. GI complications: The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of GI complications, including pancreatitis or bowel obstruction.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and chole tube drainage.
2. Wean pressors and consider further fluid bolus PRN.
3. Continue HAART per ID recommendations.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including liver enzymes, white blood cell count, and electrolyte levels.
5. Consider further imaging studies, including CT or MRI, to evaluate the patient's liver and biliary tract.
6. Consult with infectious disease and surgical specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.
7. Consider restarting acyclovir for herpes suppression.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to ensure that his condition is improving."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, fever, and cholelithiasis. The patient has a history of c.diff infection, and current lab results show an increased white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving antibiotics, pain management medication, and fluids. The patient's EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and abnormal liver function tests suggest ongoing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Cholelithiasis: The patient's cholelithiasis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as pancreatitis, cholangitis, or even death.
3. C.diff infection: The patient's c.diff infection may spread to other parts of the body, leading to complications such as colitis, sepsis, or even death if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to organ dysfunction, shock, or even death.
5. Pain management: The patient's acute and chronic pain may not be adequately managed, leading to discomfort, anxiety, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, or even death if not managed promptly and effectively.
7. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not closely monitored, leading to complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or even death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and adjust as necessary based on lab results.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust fluid management as necessary.
3. Manage the patient's pain effectively using a combination of medications and non-pharmacological interventions.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's cholelithiasis and potential complications.
6. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist to assist in managing the patient's c.diff infection and cholelithiasis.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further interventions if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with HIV, who was admitted with neutropenic fevers, acute on chronic LE edema, abdominal pain and tenderness, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a history of Karposi lymphoma of the inguinal lymph nodes with lymphedema in the left leg, and has been treated with Truvada and Kaletra.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 110/51 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.06 mcg/kg/min to sustain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 65 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 10,226 mL of fluid, with a net balance of 6,466 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC) 1.0 x 10^9/L, with 16% neutrophils, 8% bands, and 74% lymphocytes.
	+ Hemoglobin (Hb) 11.7 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) 39.1%, and platelet count (Plt) 103 x 10^9/L.
	+ Liver enzymes: Alanine transaminase (ALT) 18 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 15 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) 49 IU/L, and total bilirubin (T Bili) 0.9 mg/dL.
	+ Electrolytes: Sodium (Na) 135 mmol/L, potassium (K) 3.7 mmol/L, chloride (Cl) 103 mmol/L, and calcium (Ca) 7.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to his neutropenic fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to cholangitis, pancreatitis, or AIDS cholangiopathy.
* LE edema: The patient's LE edema may be related to cellulitis or lymphedema.
* Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia may be related to his HIV infection, chemotherapy, or other underlying medical conditions.
* HIV: The patient's HIV infection may be related to his recent diagnosis and treatment with Truvada and Kaletra.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Levophed infusion to sustain a MAP of greater than 65 mmHg.
* Aggressive IV fluid boluses to maintain a CVP of greater than 10 mmHg.
* Antibiotics: The patient is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for possible sepsis and abdominal infection.
* Cultures: Cultures are pending to determine the source of the patient's infection.
* Serial lactates: The patient's lactate levels will be monitored serially to assess for sepsis.
* Tylenol: The patient will receive acetaminophen to control his fever.
* Surgery consultation: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may require surgical consultation.
* RUQ U/S: The patient will undergo a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate for possible cholecystitis.
* Hep serologies: The patient's liver enzymes will be monitored serially to assess for liver function.
* Hold Truvada: The patient's Truvada will be held due to his neutropenic fever and elevated liver enzymes.
* IVF: The patient will receive IV fluids to maintain hydration.
* Fractionate bili: The patient's bilirubin levels will be monitored serially to assess for liver function.
* Hemolysis labs: The patient's hemolysis labs will be monitored serially to assess for hemolytic anemia.
* Consider ERCP/MRCP: The patient may require ERCP or MRCP to further evaluate for possible AIDS cholangiopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV, lymphoma, and kaposi's sarcoma, currently admitted to the ICU with neutropenic fever, acute on chronic LE edema, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes. He has been treated with antibiotics, levophed, and IV fluids, but continues to spike temperatures and has developed chest pain and reproducible palpation pain along the left rib cage. He has also developed marked swelling of the bilateral lower extremities with diffuse erythema and warmth.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. The unclear infectious etiology and potential for cellulitis, cholangitis, or other abdominal infections make it essential to continue aggressive treatment with antibiotics and IV fluids.
2. AIDS Cholangiopathy: The patient's history of truvada use and the presence of mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation on CT scan suggest the possibility of AIDS cholangiopathy. Further evaluation with ERCP/MRCP may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and history of truvada use suggest the possibility of lactic acidosis. Further evaluation with liver function tests and serial lactate levels is necessary to monitor for this complication.
4. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's lipase levels are normal, the presence of abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of pancreatitis. Further evaluation with imaging studies and serial liver function tests is necessary to rule out this complication.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and chest pain suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or acute coronary syndrome. Further evaluation with EKG changes, troponin levels, and cardiac imaging studies is necessary to rule out these complications.
6. Neutropenic Complications: The patient's neutropenic fever and low WBC count make him susceptible to neutropenic complications, such as septicemia or pneumonia. Further evaluation with serial WBC counts and differential counts is necessary to monitor for these complications.
7. HIV-Related Complications: The patient's history of HIV and lymphoma make him susceptible to HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Further evaluation with serial CD4 counts and viral loads is necessary to monitor for these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV, lymphoma, and abdominal pain. He has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, neutropenic fever, and abdominal pain.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 91 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient has a history of HIV and has been taking antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for some time. He has also had a history of lymphoma and has undergone treatment.

The patient's abdominal pain is severe and has been present for several days. He has also had a fever and has been experiencing diarrhea.

The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics. He is also receiving oxygen therapy and has been given analgesics for pain.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 1.0 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L)
* Neutrophil count: 16% (normal range: 40-70%)
* Lymphocyte count: 74% (normal range: 20-50%)
* Platelet count: 212 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* CT scan of the abdomen: shows mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation and an enlarged gallbladder, but no evidence of cholecystitis.
* CT scan of the legs: shows widespread edema, but no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: the patient's fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea are consistent with sepsis, and his laboratory results show a high white blood cell count and a high lactate level.
* Abdominal sepsis: the patient's abdominal pain and tenderness, along with his laboratory results showing a high white blood cell count and a high lactate level, suggest the possibility of abdominal sepsis.
* Cholangitis: the patient's history of HIV and his laboratory results showing a high bilirubin level and a high lactate level suggest the possibility of cholangitis.
* AIDS cholangiopathy: the patient's history of HIV and his laboratory results showing a high bilirubin level and a high lactate level suggest the possibility of AIDS cholangiopathy.
* Leukemia: the patient's history of lymphoma and his laboratory results showing a low white blood cell count and a high lactate level suggest the possibility of leukemia.

In conclusion, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of HIV and lymphoma who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, neutropenic fever, and abdominal pain. He has a number of potential medical complications that can arise, including sepsis, abdominal sepsis, cholangitis, AIDS cholangiopathy, and leukemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45M HIV (dx [**2134**], last CD4 212, VL undetectable) on truvada +/- kaletra
   with h/o karposi lymphoma of inguinal LNs w/lymphadema in LE, RPR
   positive s/p penicillin tx [**5-23**], now p/w neutropenic fevers, acute on
   chronic LE edema, abdominal pain and tenderness and elevated t bilis.
   # Sepsis: hypotensive to 80s/50s with neutropenic fever to 102 and
   hypotension. 8% bands in setting of leukopenia. unclear infectious
   etiology, ? cellulitis vs cholangitis vs other abdominal.
    - levophed as needed to sustain MAP > 65
    - aggressive IVF boluses, CVP > 10
    - antibiotics as above
    - cultures pending
    - serial lactates
    - tylenol < 2g to control fevers
   # Abdominal Pain: epigastric pain and tense, diffusely tender abdomen,
   no rebound, +/- guarding, with watery diarrhea nonbloody and with
   elevated t bili and elevated lactate but low alk phos, no
   transaminitis, normal lipase. ct abd with enlarged gallbladder but no
   e/o cholecystitis but mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, ? AIDS
   cholangiopathy. possibly known complication of truvada with lactic
   acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis. unlikely pancreatitis
   given normal lipase. could consider cardiac etiology given hypotension
   but normal trops and no significant EKG changes.
    - surgery consulting
    - RUQ U/S
    - vanc/zosyn/clinda
    - serial lactates
    - serial abdominal exams
    - dilaudid for pain, try to monitor exams
    - hep serologies
    - hold truvada
    - IVF
    - fractionate bili
    - hemolysis labs
    - consider ERCP/MRCP to further evaluate for ?AIDS cholangitis
   # LE Edema: LE edema, unlikely cellulitis, L>R, from feet to groin, CT
   scan showing widespread edema. No subcutaenous air to suggest
   necrotizing fasciatus. No e/o DVT.
    - Vanc/Zosyn
    - Clinda for anaerobe coverage
    - sepsis tx as above
    - f/u surgery recs
   # Neutropenia: WBC 1.0, N:16 Band:8 L:74. etiology unclear at this
   time. h/o lymphoma thought to be in remission.
    - follow diffs, ANCs
    - check CD4+ count (although unlikely helpful in acute setting)
    - check CMV, EBV, hep Vs, B-19
    - review medications for potential causes of leukopenia
    - neutropenic precautions
    - discuss w/1' oncologist
   # HIV: dx [**2134**], last CD4 212, VL undetectable
    - hold truvada + kaletra
    - recheck CD4 and viral load
    - ID consult
   # Anxiety: hold benzos for now in setting of sepsis
   # Herpes: stable, no changes in management
    - consider restarting acyclovir, unclear compliance
   # FEN: IVF as needed, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: CVL, peripherals
   # Communication: Patient

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with HIV, who was admitted to the ICU with neutropenic fevers, acute on chronic LE edema, abdominal pain and tenderness, and elevated bilirubin. He has a history of Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and LE. The patient's current condition includes:

* Neutropenic fever (WBC 1.0, N:16 Band:8 L:74)
* Abdominal pain and tenderness with elevated bilirubin and lactate
* LE edema, likely not cellulitis, with widespread edema on CT scan
* Hypotension (MAP 65) with low blood pressure
* Elevated creatinine (1.5 mg/dL) and lactate (2.5 mmol/L)
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT 18, AST 15, Alk Phos 49, T Bili 0.9)
* Abnormal coagulation studies (PT 13.3, PTT 29.2, INR 1.1)

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever, hypotension, and elevated lactate suggest sepsis. The infectious etiology is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.
2. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may be related to cholangitis, pancreatitis, or AIDS cholangiopathy. Further evaluation, including RUQ US and CT scan, is needed to determine the cause.
3. LE Edema: The patient's widespread edema may be related to lymphedema or cellulitis. Further evaluation, including CT scan and US, is needed to determine the cause.
4. Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia may be related to his lymphoma or HIV. Further evaluation, including CD4 count and viral load, is needed to determine the cause.
5. HIV-Related Complications: The patient's HIV may be contributing to his current condition. Further evaluation, including ID consult and HIV serologies, is needed to determine the cause.
6. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate may be related to his HIV or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation, including hep serologies, is needed to determine the cause.
7. Hepatomegaly: The patient's elevated bilirubin and lactate may be related to his HIV or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation, including liver function tests, is needed to determine the cause.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and IVF as needed to manage sepsis.
2. Perform RUQ US and CT scan to evaluate for abdominal complications.
3. Consider ERCP/MRCP to further evaluate for AIDS cholangiopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and coagulation studies.
5. Consider ID consult to evaluate the patient's HIV and potential complications.
6. Hold truvada and kaletra and recheck CD4 count and viral load.
7. Continue neutropenic precautions and discuss with the patient's oncologist.
8. Monitor the patient's lactate and consider further evaluation for lactic acidosis.
9. Consider restarting acyclovir for herpes management."
