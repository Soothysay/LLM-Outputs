   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -will give lasix 60mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulm edema
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi, cardiac
   enzymes also c/w this
   -cdiff unlikely as pt s belly pain and no loose stools. Will send cdiff
   when possible but will d/c empiric cdiff coverage
   - blood, sputum, urine cx [**Last Name (LF) 2908**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue to follow
    - empiric abx coverage x1 additional day c vanc and meropenem, but if
   cx neg tomorrow will dc as have low suspicion of infection etiology of
   hypotension
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -consider repeat TTE to see if worsening EF

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 10165**] appears ready to extubate on minimal PSV/ CPAP support. He
   has needed atropine for symptomatic bradycardia. There are no new
   septic foci and I suspect acute decompensation is primarily cardiogenic
   given rapid turnaround. We will request Cardiology colleagues to advise
   regarding need for pacemaker/ AICD and med adjustment for ischemic CM
   and arrhythmia issues. We will restart lasix/ diuril today before
   extubation. We will also complete full antibiotics by am [**2178-9-1**].
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 10165**] appears ready to extubate on minimal PSV/ CPAP support. He
   has needed atropine for symptomatic bradycardia. There are no new
   septic foci and I suspect acute decompensation is primarily cardiogenic
   given rapid turnaround. We will request Cardiology colleagues to advise
   regarding need for pacemaker/ AICD and med adjustment for ischemic CM
   and arrhythmia issues. We will restart lasix/ diuril today before
   extubation. We will also complete full antibiotics by am [**2178-9-1**].
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. He was admitted with sepsis from a urinary source, complicated by fluid overload, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and is being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.9 x 10^9/L, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 238 mg/L, and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 398 IU/L. His troponin-T level is elevated at 0.23 ng/mL, suggesting cardiac ischemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history and laboratory results suggest that he may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac ischemia.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Infectious complications: The patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis from a urinary source may lead to infectious complications, such as bacteremia, septic shock, and endocarditis.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus and history of VF arrest may increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of VF arrest and cardiac arrest may increase his risk for neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation with PEEP and titrate to optimal settings.
2. Continue antibiotics and diuretics to manage sepsis and fluid overload.
3. Monitor cardiac enzymes and troponin-T levels to assess for cardiac ischemia.
4. Consider cardiac consult for further evaluation and management of cardiac complications.
5. Monitor respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
6. Consider restarting tube feeds if not extubating.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and sepsis, and adjust antibiotics and diuretics accordingly.
8. Consider cardiac enzymes and troponin-T levels to assess for cardiac ischemia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -likely will need to restart lasix
   - empiric abx coverage with vanco & flagyl in addition to meropenum
   - blood, sputum, urine cx NGTD
   -cdiff not sent [**1-26**] no stool.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi
   -would repeat ekg.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -repeat TTE to see if worsening ef
   .
   #. Fevers - Patient with intermittent fevers, though afebrile over past
   24 hrs. now with huge jump in WBC which resolved w/in 12 hours.  CT
   showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source. No evidence of osteo on
   Xray and vascular commented that the wound does not look acutely
   infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on
   [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.  Pt
s MS improved post-intubation so meningitis
   less likely.
   - pan culture as above, f/u
   .
   # Pseudomonas UTI - complete meropenem for 14 day total course per ID
   (last day [**8-31**]), will continue for today given recent ? sepsis, though
   this seems less likely
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.3. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].
   -hold coumadin today for INR of 3.5
   .
   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days
   .
   #. Thrush - patient was started on nystatin mouth washes today for
   thrush
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, consider restart tube feeds if not extubating.
   -hyperkalemia - recheck labs, monitor EKG.
   #. PPx: INR therapeutic on coumadin

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis from a urinary source, complicated by fluid overload and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening respiratory failure, hypotension, and fever.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Flash Pulmonary Edema:** Given the patient's history of mechanical aortic valve replacement and worsening fluid overload, there is a risk of flash pulmonary edema.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient's sepsis has not been fully resolved, and there is a risk of continued septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, particularly given his mechanical aortic valve and history of bleeding complications.
4. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen, and there is a risk of requiring mechanical ventilation.
5. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's cardiac history and recent VF arrest make him at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
6. **Infection:** The patient's infection has not been fully cleared, and there is a risk of further complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
7. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and there is a risk of malnutrition and related complications.
8. **Wound Complications:** The patient's decubitus ulcer and leg ulcer are at risk of worsening, and there is a risk of infection and further complications.
9. **Thrush:** The patient's thrush is a concern, particularly given his immunocompromised state.
10. **Hyperkalemia:** The patient's hyperkalemia is a concern, particularly given his cardiac history and risk of arrhythmias.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Management:** The patient should continue to receive ICU-level care, including close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory status.
2. **Antibiotic Therapy:** The patient should continue to receive empiric antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin and meropenem, to cover potential infections.
3. **Cardiac Management:** The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to adjusting his anticoagulation therapy and cardiac medications.
4. **Nutritional Support:** The patient should receive aggressive nutritional support, including enteral feeding and consideration of parenteral nutrition if necessary.
5. **Wound Care:** The patient's wounds should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to debridement and other wound care interventions.
6. **Thrush Treatment:** The patient's thrush should be treated with antifungal medications, and consideration should be given to oral care interventions.
7. **Hyperkalemia Management:** The patient's hyperkalemia should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to adjusting his medications and electrolyte levels."

   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -likely will need to restart lasix
   - empiric abx coverage with vanco & flagyl in addition to meropenum
   - blood, sputum, urine cx NGTD
   -cdiff not sent [**1-26**] no stool.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi
   -would repeat ekg.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -repeat TTE to see if worsening ef
   .
   #. Fevers - Patient with intermittent fevers, though afebrile over past
   24 hrs. now with huge jump in WBC which resolved w/in 12 hours.  CT
   showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source. No evidence of osteo on
   Xray and vascular commented that the wound does not look acutely
   infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on
   [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.  Pt
s MS improved post-intubation so meningitis
   less likely.
   - pan culture as above, f/u
   .
   # Pseudomonas UTI - complete meropenem for 14 day total course per ID
   (last day [**8-31**]), will continue for today given recent ? sepsis, though
   this seems less likely
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.3. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].
   -hold coumadin today for INR of 3.5
   .
   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days
   .
   #. Thrush - patient was started on nystatin mouth washes today for
   thrush
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, consider restart tube feeds if not extubating.
   -hyperkalemia - recheck labs, monitor EKG.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent ICD explantation. He is currently intubated and ventilated due to acute respiratory failure, which is likely caused by fluid overload and worsening chronic systolic heart failure. He also has a decubitus ulcer, urinary tract infection, and a wound infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is rapidly declining, and he may require more aggressive ventilation or even extrusion.
2. Heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure is worsening, and he may require more aggressive diuresis and cardiovascular medications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection and a wound infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient is on heparin bridge therapy for his mechanical aortic valve, and his INR is slightly elevated.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and he may require further monitoring and treatment.
6. Pseudomonas UTI: The patient has a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, which requires continued antibiotic therapy.
7. Thrush: The patient has thrush, which requires treatment with antifungal medications.
8. Leg ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer, which requires wound care and debridement.
9. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has intermittent fevers, which may be related to his infections or other underlying conditions.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's heart failure with diuretics and cardiovascular medications.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infections with antibiotics and antifungal medications.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulation status and adjust heparin bridge therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to treat the patient's thrush with antifungal medications.
7. Continue to manage the patient's leg ulcer with wound care and debridement.
8. Consider restarting lasix to help manage the patient's fluid overload.
9. Consider calling a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary."

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -will give lasix 60mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulm edema
   - empiric abx coverage with vanco & flagyl in addition to meropenum
   - blood, sputum, urine cx NGTD
   -cdiff not sent [**1-26**] no stool.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi
   -would repeat ekg.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -repeat TTE to see if worsening ef
   .
   #. Fevers - Patient with intermittent fevers, though afebrile over past
   24 hrs. now with huge jump in WBC which resolved w/in 12 hours.  CT
   showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source. No evidence of osteo on
   Xray and vascular commented that the wound does not look acutely
   infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on
   [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.  Pt
s MS improved post-intubation so meningitis
   less likely.
   - pan culture as above, f/u cultures
   -more likely cardiogenic shock rather than septic shock.
   -continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], Cipro, vanco for one more day; d/c flagyl b/c no
   evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Pseudomonas UTI - complete meropenem for 14 day total course per ID
   (last day [**8-31**]), will continue for today given recent ? sepsis, though
   this seems less likely
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.3. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].
   -hold coumadin today for INR of 3.5
   .
   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days
   .
   #. Thrush - patient was started on nystatin mouth washes today for
   thrush
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, consider restart tube feeds if not extubating.
   -hyperkalemia - recheck labs, monitor EKG.
   #. PPx: INR therapeutic on coumadin
   #. ACCESS: PICC, will likely need central access and A-line today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Assessment & Plan: The patient is a 67y/o M with a complex PMH
   including DM type 2, [**Hospital3 5393**] mechanical AVR ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta
   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure .
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Patient with a rapid decline in
   resiratory status which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema given
   worsening fluid on CXR, less likely sepsis, cdiff or pna. ventilatory
   failure possibly [**1-26**] increased work of breathing
   - on psv 5/5, consider extubation later today
   -will give lasix 60mg IV and metolazone to avoid flash pulm edema
   - empiric abx coverage with vanco & flagyl in addition to meropenum
   - blood, sputum, urine cx NGTD
   -cdiff not sent [**1-26**] no stool.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi
   -would repeat ekg.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  He had not been diuresed over the past 24hrs as the team
   thought he may be at his dry weight.  CXR worsening
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -consider calling cards ? sick sinus syndrome and ? etiology of tenuous
   volume status
   -repeat TTE to see if worsening ef
   .
   #. Fevers - Patient with intermittent fevers, though afebrile over past
   24 hrs. now with huge jump in WBC which resolved w/in 12 hours.  CT
   showed no evidence for abdominal/pelvic source. No evidence of osteo on
   Xray and vascular commented that the wound does not look acutely
   infected. S/p debridement on [**2178-6-29**] with additional debridement on
   [**2178-8-25**]. Cdiff negative.  Pt
s MS improved post-intubation so meningitis
   less likely.
   - pan culture as above, f/u cultures
   -more likely cardiogenic shock rather than septic shock.
   -continue [**Last Name (un) 430**], Cipro, vanco for one more day; d/c flagyl b/c no
   evidence of diarrhea
   .
   # Pseudomonas UTI - complete meropenem for 14 day total course per ID
   (last day [**8-31**]), will continue for today given recent ? sepsis, though
   this seems less likely
   .
   # s/p Mechanical AVR - currently on heparin bridge to coumadin with
   goal INR 2.5-3.5. INR today was 2.3. Patient needs bridge due to low EF
   and mechanical aortic valve. Received 2mg po vitamin K on [**2178-8-23**].
   -hold coumadin today for INR of 3.5
   .
   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days
   .
   #. Thrush - patient was started on nystatin mouth washes today for
   thrush
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, consider restart tube feeds if not extubating.
   -hyperkalemia - recheck labs, monitor EKG.
   #. PPx: INR therapeutic on coumadin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

* The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, history of ventricular fibrillation arrest, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) explantation.
* He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, which is likely due to fluid overload and worsening heart failure.
* His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
* He has a history of sepsis from a urinary source, which is complicated by fluid overload, causing respiratory failure.
* He is currently on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and has a rapid decline in respiratory status, which is concerning for flash pulmonary edema.
* He has a fever of unknown origin, which is being monitored.
* He has a chronic systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, which is being managed with amiodarone and atorvastatin.
* He has a history of pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), which has been treated with meropenem for 14 days.
* He has a leg ulcer, which is being managed by vascular surgery, and thrush, which is being treated with nystatin mouthwashes.
* He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, and is currently on insulin and statin therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: Given the patient's worsening fluid overload and respiratory failure, there is a high risk of developing flash pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin and history of sepsis from a urinary source make him at risk for developing sepsis again.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest make him at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring further interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation.
5. Infection: The patient's history of pseudomonas UTI and thrush make him at risk for developing other infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of anticoagulation therapy and mechanical aortic valve replacement make him at risk for bleeding complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and dyslipidemia make him at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or pancreatitis.

Based on the patient's current health status and potential medical complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload and respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and diuretics.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and manage any cardiac complications that arise.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and manage any infections that develop.
5. Consider restarting tube feeds if the patient is not extubated.
6. Consider calling a cardiologist to discuss the patient's cardiac status and potential cardiac complications.
7. Consider repeating a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess the patient's cardiac function and estimate EF."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and a history of ventricular fibrillation with subsequent explantation of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE bacteremia. He was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload, which led to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, likely cardiogenic flash pulmonary edema, with a brief episode of hypotension after diuresis, which improved with a small fluid bolus.
* Heart failure, systolic, acute on chronic, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.
* Fever, unknown origin, which has been absent for 72 hours.
* Chronic systolic CHF, with a history of VF arrest and ICD explantation.
* Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), with a 14-day course of meropenem complete, and planned to discontinue if culture results are negative.
* Mechanical AVR, with a heparin bridge to coumadin complete, and INR 3.6, which is slightly above the therapeutic range.
* Diabetes mellitus type 2, with a plan to continue home lantus and insulin sliding scale.
* Dyslipidemia, with a plan to continue statin therapy.
* Leg ulcer, which is being followed by vascular surgery and does not appear to be infected.
* Thrush, which was treated with nystatin mouthwashes.
* Fluid overload, with a total fluid input of 2,773 mL and a total fluid output of 2,680 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely cardiogenic, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VF arrest and ICD explantation increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and fever could lead to sepsis, which could further complicate his respiratory and cardiac status.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's mechanical AVR and history of ICD explantation increase the risk of coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
5. Wound complications: The patient's leg ulcer and history of ICD explantation increase the risk of wound complications, including infection or bleeding.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload could lead to further respiratory and cardiac compromise.
7. Insulin resistance: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and history of ICD explantation could increase the risk of insulin resistance, which could lead to hyperglycemia and further complications.

In summary, the patient's complex medical history and current condition pose a high risk of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent further deterioration."

   repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF arrest s/p AICD [**2175**] with subsequent
   explantation in setting of recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI [**4-2**],
   admission for sepsis from urinary source complicated by fluid overload
   causing respiratory failure.  Pt again presents with respiratory
   failure.
   .
   # Acute respiratory failure - Likely cardiogenic flash pulmonary edema
   in the setting of volume overload.  Very much improved yesterday -
   extubated successfully after diuresis.  However, at baseline his
   cardiac function is still very tenuous.  Brief episode of hypotension
   yesterday after diuresis, improved with small fluid bolus.
   -successful extubation yesterday as above.
   -fluid balance since extubation.
   - albuterol and ipratropium inhalers
   - chest PT and suctioning as possible.
   - cardiac enzymes c/w demand ischemia versus small nstemi, cardiac
   enzymes also c/w this
   -cdiff unlikely as pt s belly pain and no loose stools. Will send cdiff
   when possible but stopped empiric coverage yesterday
   - blood, sputum, urine cx [**Last Name (LF) 2908**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] continue to follow
    - decided yesterday to continue empiric abx coverage x1 additional day
   with vanc and meropenem, f/u cultures today and DC if negative.  Low
   suspicion for infection as cause of repiratory failure.
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 20% s/p VF arrest [**2175**] and ICD
   explantation.  Diuresed yesterday mid-day, running even since then.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Continue atorvastatin
   -cardiology consulted yesterday, appreciate recs.
        -will plan to start beta blockade and ACE inhibitor when condition
   allows
        -plan to transfer to [**Hospital1 2259**] service when stable
        -currently no indication for pacer/AICD placement
   -consider repeat TTE to see if worsening EF

   # Pseudomonas UTI
 14d meropenem course complete - DC today if culture
   negative, as above.

   # s/p Mechanical AVR - had been on heparin bridge to coumadin with goal
   INR 2.5-3.5. INR today 3.6 -  3.5 yesterday. Heparin bridge to coumadin
   complete.
   -hold coumadin today for INR of 3.6

   # DM type 2 - continue home lantus and insulin SS
   -half dose lantus given yesterday evening for concerns of decreased PO
   intake
   .
   # Dyslipidemia - continue statin

   #. Leg Ulcer - vascular surgery is following and does not feel that
   wound is infected.
   - Wound vac changes per vascular surgery q3days
   - Reported pain in right foot  yesterday, reponded to Percocet.  Good
   pulses by Doppler.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including DM type 2, mechanical AVR, ascending aorta repair with graft, and a history of VF arrest with subsequent explantation of AICD due to recurrent high-grade CoNS and VRE BSI. He was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload, causing respiratory failure. He has been treated with antibiotics and has undergone diuresis, which has improved his respiratory status.

The patient's current condition is:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for cardiogenic flash pulmonary edema due to volume overload. He has had a brief episode of hypotension after diuresis, which improved with a small fluid bolus.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has been treated with antibiotics.
3. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic CHF with an EF of 20%, which is a risk factor for respiratory failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient is on coumadin and has an INR of 3.6, which is slightly above the therapeutic range.
5. Pain: The patient has reported pain in his right foot, which has responded to Percocet.
6. Nutritional status: The patient is eating well and has been receiving nutrition support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to cardiogenic flash pulmonary edema and volume overload.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to the UTI and potential secondary infections.
3. Heart failure: The patient is at risk for further heart failure due to his chronic systolic CHF and the potential for worsening EF.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his coagulopathy and the potential for further INR elevation.
5. Pain: The patient is at risk for further pain due to his right foot ulcer and potential for further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for the UTI.
2. Monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjusting therapy as needed.
3. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and adjusting therapy as needed.
4. Monitoring of the patient's coagulopathy and adjusting therapy as needed.
5. Pain management and wound care for the right foot ulcer.
6. Nutrition support and monitoring of the patient's nutritional status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair, and a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent explantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload, which caused respiratory failure. The patient was successfully extubated after diuresis, but remains at risk for respiratory failure due to cardiogenic flash pulmonary edema and volume overload. He also has chronic systolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction of 20%, and is at risk for further cardiac complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely cardiogenic in origin, and he may be at risk for further episodes of respiratory failure due to his tenuous cardiac function and volume overload.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure and history of ventricular fibrillation arrest make him at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis and urinary tract infection, and is at risk for further infections, particularly given his compromised immune function.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to further complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Wound Complications: The patient has a decubitus ulcer and a leg ulcer, which may become infected and lead to further complications.
6. Pseudomonas UTI: The patient has completed a 14-day course of meropenem for a Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, and may be at risk for further infection if the culture is negative.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 3.6, which is above the therapeutic range, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has type 2 diabetes and may be at risk for hyperglycemic complications, including hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
9. Dyslipidemia: The patient has dyslipidemia and may be at risk for further complications, including atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient should be continued on empiric antibiotic coverage for 1 additional day, and then reassessed for further treatment. The patient's cardiac function should be closely monitored, and he should be continued on dopamine and amiodarone. The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, and he should be continued on insulin sliding scale. The patient's wound care should be continued, and he should be followed closely for signs of infection. The patient's INR should be closely monitored, and he should be continued on coumadin. The patient's code status should be full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, and a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and subsequent explantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload, leading to respiratory failure. He was extubated successfully after diuresis, but remains on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Fever of unknown origin
* Heart failure (systolic, acute on chronic)
* Respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS)
* Alteration in nutrition
* Impaired skin integrity
* Coagulopathy
* Decubitus ulcer (present at admission)
* Diabetes mellitus (type 2)
* Pain control (acute and chronic)
* SIRS
* Urinary tract infection (UTI)

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to heart failure
	* Ventricular arrhythmias due to cardiac ischemia or small myocardial infarction
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
3. Infection complications:
	* Bacteremia or sepsis due to UTI or other sources
	* Wound infection or cellulitis
4. Coagulation complications:
	* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to coagulopathy
5. Nutritional complications:
	* Malnutrition or dehydration due to altered nutrition and fluid balance
6. Skin integrity complications:
	* Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers
7. Pain management complications:
	* Opioid tolerance or dependence
	* Chronic pain management issues
8. Endocrine complications:
	* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to diabetes mellitus
9. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to underlying conditions
10. Infectious complications:
	* UTI or other infections due to catheterization or other invasive procedures

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management. The plan is to continue empiric antibiotic coverage for one additional day and then discontinue if cultures are negative. The patient will be weaned off dopamine and continue on amiodarone and atorvastatin. Cardiology will be consulted to plan for beta blockade and ACE inhibitor therapy when the patient's condition allows. The patient will be transferred to a step-down unit when stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes type 2, mechanical aortic valve replacement, ascending aorta repair with graft, and a history of ventricular fibrillation arrest with subsequent explantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. He was admitted for sepsis from a urinary source complicated by fluid overload causing respiratory failure. He is currently weaning off dopamine and is on room air. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 106/51 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and he may require ongoing mechanical ventilation to support his breathing.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload is a risk factor for worsening respiratory failure and may require ongoing management with diuretics and fluid restriction.
3. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis and pseudomonas UTI puts him at risk for ongoing infection, and he may require ongoing antibiotics and monitoring for signs of infection.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation arrest and mechanical aortic valve replacement puts him at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis and fluid overload puts him at risk for ongoing sepsis, and he may require ongoing monitoring for signs of sepsis and prompt treatment if sepsis recurs.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's fluid overload and history of sepsis put him at risk for renal failure, and he may require ongoing monitoring of his renal function and prompt treatment if renal failure develops.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and history of sepsis put him at risk for developing pneumonia, and he may require ongoing monitoring for signs of pneumonia and prompt treatment if pneumonia develops.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload with diuretics and fluid restriction to prevent worsening respiratory failure.
3. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent ongoing infection.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and medication regimen as needed to prevent renal failure.
6. Consider obtaining a chest CT scan to rule out pneumonia and other pulmonary complications.
7. Consider obtaining a urine culture to monitor for signs of ongoing infection."
