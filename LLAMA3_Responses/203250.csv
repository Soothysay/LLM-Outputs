   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**])
   with AV and MV valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI
   bleed
   .
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.
   -          Start low dose Metoprolol IV for HR control to help forward
   flow.
   -          Lasix prn
   Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Need to have dialogue with
   surgery if she will be candidate for surgery in the future.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - TEE today
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused
   - GI recs for endoscopy
   - Will transfuse as needed
   - Trend HCT
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will start BB
   - Heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   .
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   - TEE today
   .
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - Continue Vanco and Meropenem
   - Check CDiff, start IV Flagyl
   .
   # HTN:  BP 108/43.  SBPs on admission in 80s.
   - Start BB.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue home synthroid.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Thrombus progression: The patient has a prosthetic mitral valve thrombus, and the management plan includes continuing heparin and considering surgery in the future. There is a risk of further thrombus progression, which could lead to cardiac complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has poorly rate-controlled atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thrombus formation and embolic events.
3. Congestive heart failure: The patient has acute congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation, which can lead to further cardiac complications.
4. GI bleed: The patient has had a recent GI bleed, and the source is unclear. There is a risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and other complications.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has possible RLL pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection. The differential diagnosis includes infected thrombus, and further testing is needed to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which could be exacerbated by the patient's current condition and medications.
8. Neurological deficits: The patient has neurological deficits on exam, which could be related to the patient's recent hemorrhagic stroke. There is a risk of further embolic events.
9. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which could be exacerbated by the patient's current condition and medications.

The patient's current medications include heparin, lasix, metoprolol, and protonix, among others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin-T, and lactate levels, which could indicate cardiac or respiratory complications.

The patient's plan of care includes starting low-dose metoprolol for heart rate control, continuing heparin for thrombus progression, and considering surgery in the future. The patient will also require close monitoring for signs of cardiac, respiratory, or neurological complications."

   The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
   the body of the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
   contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
   appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus
   is seen in the tip of the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the
   ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
   are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta up to 35cm from
   the incisor. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6cm2 by planimetry).
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. There is extensive
   thrombus around the ring of the prosthesis that measures at least 3.4cm
   by 1.1cm by dimension. There is a highly mobile component of the
   thrombus that measure 1.9cm x 0.5cm that prolapses through the mitral
   valve orifice. The anterior/septal mitral valve leaflet is completely
   immobile. The posterior/lateral leaflet moves well. The gradients
   across the mitral valve is suggestive of severe valvular mitral
   stenosis. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present with trace
   tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: Extensive thrombus around the mechanical mitral prosthesis
   causing severe mitral stenosis. Severe aortic stenosis. Thrombus in the
   left atrial appendage.
   CXR: worsening infilterates involving midzones of both lungs suggests
   superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia or unusual pattern of progression of heart
   failure. The
   remainder of the study including the lines and tubes are unchanged.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with AV and MV
   valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI bleed
   .
   # Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Patient would likely be a
   poor surgical candidate.  This issue represents an end-stage disease
   and this is understood by family.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - Palliative care consult
   - Goal to get home with family, respiratory support and pain control
   .
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.   Good response to low-dose IV metoprolol.
   - PO metoprolol 25 mg TID.
   - Bumex 1 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is
 home dose with goal of even
   .
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused.  Hct responded
   appropriately but then came back down.
   - GI recs for endoscopy
   - Transfusion for symptomatic anemia
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will start BB
   - Heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
   .
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   .
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   - TEE today
   .
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.  C. diff negatibe
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - Continue Vanco and Meropenem
   - D/C flagyl
   .
   # HTN:  BP 108/43.  SBPs on admission in 80s.
   - Start BB.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue home synthroid.
   .
   # s/p hemorrhagic stroke:  Patient with neurological deficits on exam.
   Patient at risk for further embolic event with thrombus.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
   the body of the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
   contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
   appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus
   is seen in the tip of the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the
   ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
   are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta up to 35cm from
   the incisor. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6cm2 by planimetry).
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. There is extensive
   thrombus around the ring of the prosthesis that measures at least 3.4cm
   by 1.1cm by dimension. There is a highly mobile component of the
   thrombus that measure 1.9cm x 0.5cm that prolapses through the mitral
   valve orifice. The anterior/septal mitral valve leaflet is completely
   immobile. The posterior/lateral leaflet moves well. The gradients
   across the mitral valve is suggestive of severe valvular mitral
   stenosis. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present with trace
   tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: Extensive thrombus around the mechanical mitral prosthesis
   causing severe mitral stenosis. Severe aortic stenosis. Thrombus in the
   left atrial appendage.
   CXR: worsening infilterates involving midzones of both lungs suggests
   superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia or unusual pattern of progression of heart
   failure. The
   remainder of the study including the lines and tubes are unchanged.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with AV and MV
   valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI bleed
   .
   # Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Patient would likely be a
   poor surgical candidate.  This issue represents an end-stage disease
   and this is understood by family.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - Palliative care consult
   - Goal to get home with family, respiratory support and pain control
   .
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.   Good response to low-dose IV metoprolol.
   - PO metoprolol 25 mg TID.
   - Bumex 1 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is
 home dose with goal of even
   .
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused.  Hct responded
   appropriately but then came back down.
   - GI recs for endoscopy
   - Transfusion for symptomatic anemia
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will start BB
   - Heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
   .
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   .
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   - TEE today

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, hemorrhagic evolution, and mechanical mitral valve thrombosis. She has been experiencing acute congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation. She has also had a GI bleed, which is unclear in origin, and is at risk for further embolic events due to the thrombus.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Non-invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, severe aortic stenosis, and mitral stenosis due to prosthetic valve thrombus
* Gastrointestinal: Unclear source of bleeding, likely lower GI
* Neurological: Hemorrhagic stroke with ongoing neurological deficits
* Hematological: Thrombocytopenia, anemia
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 25.0
	+ Hct: 25.9
	+ Platelets: 321
	+ Troponin-T: 0.05
	+ Lactic acid: 2.7 mmol/L
	+ Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
	+ LDH: 462 IU/L
	+ Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL
	+ Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
	+ PO4: 1.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation are causing significant cardiac compromise, which could lead to further decline in cardiac function.
2. Thrombotic events: The patient's history of CVA and ongoing thrombosis risk due to the prosthetic valve thrombus make her susceptible to further thrombotic events.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's unclear source of bleeding and ongoing anemia increase the risk of further bleeding episodes.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is currently adequate, but she may require more aggressive respiratory therapy if her condition worsens.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and lactate levels suggest the possibility of infection, which could be further complicated by her immunosuppressed state.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated LDH and creatinine levels suggest the possibility of kidney injury, which could be exacerbated by her cardiac and respiratory compromise.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may require close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's anemia and hypoalbuminemia suggest the possibility of nutritional deficiencies, which could be addressed through enteral nutrition support.
9. Psychosocial issues: The patient's ongoing neurological deficits and limited mobility may impact her quality of life and require psychosocial support.

Plan:

1. Continue respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation and monitor for signs of worsening respiratory failure.
2. Manage the patient's cardiac condition with ongoing therapy for atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis.
3. Investigate the source of the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and treat accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide ongoing rehabilitation therapy to address her deficits.
5. Manage the patient's hematological abnormalities with transfusions and platelet support as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and treat any imbalances promptly.
7. Consider enteral nutrition support to address the patient's nutritional deficiencies.
8. Provide psychosocial support to address the patient's ongoing neurological deficits and limited mobility."

   The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
   the body of the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
   contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
   appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus
   is seen in the tip of the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the
   ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
   are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta up to 35cm from
   the incisor. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened.
   There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6cm2 by planimetry).
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. There is extensive
   thrombus around the ring of the prosthesis that measures at least 3.4cm
   by 1.1cm by dimension. There is a highly mobile component of the
   thrombus that measure 1.9cm x 0.5cm that prolapses through the mitral
   valve orifice. The anterior/septal mitral valve leaflet is completely
   immobile. The posterior/lateral leaflet moves well. The gradients
   across the mitral valve is suggestive of severe valvular mitral
   stenosis. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present with trace
   tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: Extensive thrombus around the mechanical mitral prosthesis
   causing severe mitral stenosis. Severe aortic stenosis. Thrombus in the
   left atrial appendage.
   CXR: worsening infilterates involving midzones of both lungs suggests
   superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia or unusual pattern of progression of heart
   failure. The
   remainder of the study including the lines and tubes are unchanged.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with AV and MV
   valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI bleed
   .
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.
   -          Start low dose Metoprolol IV for HR control to help forward
   flow.
   -          Lasix prn
   Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Need to have dialogue with
   surgery if she will be candidate for surgery in the future.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - TEE today
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused
   - GI recs for endoscopy
   - Will transfuse as needed
   - Trend HCT
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will start BB
   - Heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   .
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   - TEE today
   .
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - Continue Vanco and Meropenem
   - Check CDiff, start IV Flagyl
   .
   # HTN:  BP 108/43.  SBPs on admission in 80s.
   - Start BB.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue home synthroid.
   .
   # s/p hemorrhagic stroke:  Patient with neurological deficits on exam.
   Patient at risk for further embolic event with thrombus.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   immobile. The posterior/lateral leaflet moves well. The gradients
   across the mitral valve is suggestive of severe valvular mitral
   stenosis. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present with trace
   tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: Extensive thrombus around the mechanical mitral prosthesis
   causing severe mitral stenosis. Severe aortic stenosis. Thrombus in the
   left atrial appendage.
   CXR: worsening infilterates involving midzones of both lungs suggests
   superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia or unusual pattern of progression of heart
   failure. The
   remainder of the study including the lines and tubes are unchanged.

   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.
   -          Start low dose Metoprolol IV for HR control to help forward
   flow.

   Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Need to have dialogue with
   surgery if she will be candidate for surgery in the future.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - TEE today
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 66-year-old female who was admitted with a history of CVA with hemorrhagic evolution, AV and MV valves, and thrombosis. She was transferred from another hospital with a prosthetic mitral valve thrombus and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been experiencing acute congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.6°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 97/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Chest: diffuse rales in the posterior lung fields
* Abdomen: soft, with voluntary guarding and no rebound tenderness
* Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Neurological examination: CN II-XII intact, with exceptions noted (plantar flexion of left and right lower extremities, handgrip on right and left, absent left-sided startle reflex, left lid lag, and facial droop)

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 25.0 cells/μL
* Hemoglobin: 25.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 355 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 462 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Prosthetic mitral valve thrombus causing severe mitral stenosis
* Severe aortic stenosis
* Thrombus in the left atrial appendage
* Acute congestive heart failure
* Gastrointestinal bleed
* Atrial fibrillation
* Poorly rate-controlled
* Coronary artery disease (documented in OSH records)
* Pump failure (previous TTE showed EF of 50% with no thrombus)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further embolic events due to the thrombus
* Infection of the prosthetic mitral valve
* Progressive heart failure
* Worsening of the gastrointestinal bleed
* Development of pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Potential for digoxin toxicity due to elevated digoxin levels

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Start low-dose metoprolol IV for heart rate control
* Continue heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
* TEE today
* Start IV flagyl for suspected infected thrombus
* Continue vancomycin and meropenem for suspected sepsis
* Check CDiff and start IV flagyl if positive
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT and PE
* Full code status
* CCU for now

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol tartrate 5 mg IV
* Lasix 40 mg IV
* Furosemide 40 mg IV
* Midazolam 1 mg IV PRN
* Ondansetron 4 mg IV

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with AV and MV
   valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI bleed, now made
   CMO
   # Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Patient would likely be a
   poor surgical candidate.  This issue represents an end-stage disease
   and this is understood by family and they have elected to make the
   patient DNR/DNI and CMO.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - Palliative care consult
   - Goal to get home with family, respiratory support and pain control
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.   Good response to low-dose IV metoprolol.
   - PO metoprolol 25 mg TID.
   - Bumex 1 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is
 home dose with goal of even
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused.  Hct responded
   appropriately but then came back down.
   -          stop lab draws
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will cont BB
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.  C. diff negatibe
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - discontinue Vanco and Meropenem
   # HTN:  BP 108/43.  SBPs on admission in 80s.
   - Cont BB.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue home synthroid.
   # s/p hemorrhagic stroke:  Patient with neurological deficits on exam.
   Patient at risk for further embolic event with thrombus.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 66-year-old female who had a stroke with hemorrhagic evolution (CVA) and was transferred to the ICU with a prosthetic mitral valve and mitral valve thrombosis, as well as a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has been experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has been treated with various medications, including heparin, warfarin, and metoprolol.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate 88 beats per minute, blood pressure 86/49 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 9 mmHg, cardiac index 2.2 L/min/m², and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 28/15 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) at 10 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O, respectively.
* Neurological status: The patient is awake and moves all four extremities with commands, but has significant weakness in the left arm and leg.
* Laboratory results: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 25,000 cells/μL, and her platelet count is 20,000 cells/μL. Her lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L, and her troponin level is 0.05 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of thrombosis and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of developing a PE.
2. Infectious complications: The patient's elevated WBC count and lactate level suggest the possibility of an infection, which could be related to the GI bleed or the prosthetic valve.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mitral valve thrombosis may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's GI bleed may continue to bleed or may develop complications such as perforation or abscesses.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological deficits may worsen or new deficits may develop due to the stroke or other underlying conditions.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications such as epistaxis, hematuria, or melena.
7. Endocarditis: The patient's prosthetic valve and history of thrombosis may increase the risk of developing endocarditis.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue heparin therapy to prevent further thrombosis and embolism.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medications as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
3. Manage the patient's GI bleed with continued transfusions and medications as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust medications as necessary to prevent further neurological deficits.
5. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infectious complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including WBC count, lactate level, and troponin level, to identify any potential complications early."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female who has suffered a hemorrhagic stroke with a prosthetic mitral valve and has developed a prosthetic mitral valve thrombus. She has also had a gastrointestinal bleed and is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Prosthetic mitral valve thrombus: The patient has a prosthetic mitral valve thrombus that is causing a high gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle, leading to poor filling of the left ventricle.
* Acute congestive heart failure: The patient has developed acute congestive heart failure secondary to the mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation.
* Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had a gastrointestinal bleed, likely in the lower gastrointestinal tract, which has led to a drop in her hemoglobin level.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has poorly rate-controlled atrial fibrillation, which is likely contributing to her congestive heart failure.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine.
* Hemorrhagic stroke: The patient has a history of hemorrhagic stroke, which has left her with neurological deficits.

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin: The patient is receiving heparin to prevent further thrombus formation and to treat her atrial fibrillation.
* Metoprolol: The patient is receiving metoprolol to control her atrial fibrillation and to reduce her blood pressure.
* Digoxin: The patient is receiving digoxin to control her atrial fibrillation, but the level of digoxin in her blood is likely toxic.
* Furosemide: The patient is receiving furosemide to manage her congestive heart failure.
* Pantoprazole: The patient is receiving pantoprazole to manage her gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Complete blood count: The patient's complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 25,000/mm3, which is elevated.
* Blood chemistry: The patient's blood chemistry shows a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, which is elevated.
* Electrolytes: The patient's electrolyte levels are normal.
* Troponin-T: The patient's troponin-T level is 0.05 ng/mL, which is elevated.

The patient's imaging studies include:

* Echocardiogram: The patient's echocardiogram shows a prosthetic mitral valve thrombus and a high gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle.
* Fluoroscopy: The patient's fluoroscopy shows a fixed leaflet on the prosthetic mitral valve.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing heparin to prevent further thrombus formation and to treat her atrial fibrillation.
* Continuing metoprolol to control her atrial fibrillation and to reduce her blood pressure.
* Continuing furosemide to manage her congestive heart failure.
* Continuing pantoprazole to manage her gastrointestinal bleed.
* Considering a palliative care consult to discuss the patient's goals of care and to manage her symptoms.
* Considering a gastroenterology consult to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal bleed and to consider endoscopy.
* Considering a cardiology consult to evaluate the patient's prosthetic mitral valve thrombus and to consider further management options.

The potential medical complications that could arise in this patient include:

* Further thrombus formation and embolization
* Worsening of congestive heart failure
* Development of atrial fibrillation
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infection of the prosthetic mitral valve thrombus
* Further neurological deficits from the hemorrhagic stroke."
