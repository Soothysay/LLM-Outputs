You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission, receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. They have been on a 24-hour antibiotics regimen, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 66 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 149/56 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 172 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.39 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total fluid intake of 1,650 mL and a total output of 285 mL. The patient's respiratory support is set to a tidal volume of 500 mL, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O and an FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their respiratory support, but their peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, and their skin, neurologic, and abdominal examinations are not documented.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is set to a tidal volume of 500 mL, which may be inadequate to meet their oxygenation needs.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance may lead to fluid overload, which can exacerbate respiratory failure and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the risk of infection remains high, particularly given their respiratory support and fluid overload.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is not well-documented, and the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, is increased in the setting of respiratory failure and fluid overload.
5. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic examination is not well-documented, and the risk of neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke, is increased in the setting of respiratory failure and fluid overload.

Further monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory support, fluid balance, and cardiovascular status are necessary to prevent these complications and optimize their care."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old intubated and sedated elderly African American female admitted to the ICU with a history of sepsis. She has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has been managed with fluid resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/56 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and is receiving oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 40%. Her laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results suggest evidence of sepsis, and her hemodynamic parameters are stable, but she may be at risk for sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and she is at risk for developing VAP, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and the presence of central lines. This could lead to pulmonary embolism and worsen her respiratory status.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer due to her sepsis and critical illness. This could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and worsen her overall condition.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated at 334 mg/dL, and she is at risk for developing hyperglycemia, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated at 149/56 mmHg, but she may be at risk for developing hypotension due to her sepsis and critical illness. This could worsen her organ function and increase the risk of mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. She is being weaned off
   sedation, currently on 25 Fentanyl, off Versed. No relative hypoxia nor
   [**Name (NI) **] gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary
   process causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for
   infxn but afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather
   than true pneumonia.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given fever, ? infiltrate vs. effusion R base
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- cycled cardiac enzymes, ? EKG changes but are stable compared with
   prior so unlikely
   -- wean O2 and change to PSV as tolerated
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Wean off vent as tolerated but currently requiring pressure support

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. She is being weaned off
   sedation, currently on 25 Fentanyl, off Versed. No relative hypoxia nor
   [**Name (NI) **] gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary
   process causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for
   infxn but afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather
   than true pneumonia.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given fever, ? infiltrate vs. effusion R base
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- cycled cardiac enzymes, ? EKG changes but are stable compared with
   prior so unlikely

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds, admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure. She has clear risk factors for and evidence of aspiration event with possible plugging of airways leading to acute changes with rapid improvement in oxygenation. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam, for possible aspiration event. Her respiratory status is critical, with acute respiratory failure, and she is being weaned off oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk factors for aspiration, including dementia and chronic G-tube feeds, increase her likelihood of developing aspiration pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation further complicate her condition.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine level suggests acute renal failure. This may be due to non-cardiogenic edema, hypovolemia, or other factors.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin level and subtle changes on ECG suggest possible cardiac injury. This may be due to acute coronary syndrome or other cardiac conditions.
4. Diabetes: The patient's poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase her risk of developing diabetic complications, including hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic G-tube feeds and risk of aspiration increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
6. Infections: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's dementia and chronic G-tube feeds increase her risk of developing neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, or other neurologic events.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or treat them effectively."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds, was admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure. She has a clear risk for and evidence of aspiration event with possible plugging of airways leading to acute changes with rapid improvement in oxygenation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.7°F (37.1°C), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 176/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and she is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, troponin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting acute kidney injury and possible cardiac injury. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and her platelet count is decreased.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and dementia, which may contribute to her current condition. She is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent this complication.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk for developing further respiratory failure, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac injury, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure and death.
5. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP, which can lead to further complications such as pneumonia and death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic G-tube feeds may increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock and death.
7. Wound complications: The patient's chronic G-tube feeds may increase her risk for wound complications such as skin breakdown and infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis and death.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. She is being weaned off
   sedation, currently on 25 Fentanyl, off Versed. No relative hypoxia nor
   [**Name (NI) **] gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary
   process causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for
   infxn but afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather
   than true pneumonia.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given fever, ? infiltrate vs. effusion R base
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- cycled cardiac enzymes, ? EKG changes but are stable compared with
   prior so unlikely
   -- wean O2 and change to PSV as tolerated
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Wean off vent as tolerated but currently requiring pressure support
   - [**Month (only) 8**] have difficulty ventilating since ETT seems too far advanced in
   CXR. Was apparently pulled back but no CXR repeat done. Will get repeat
   CXR

   # DM2
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- fixed and SS insulin, FSQ qid, continue TF diet

   # PVD
   -- stumps appear clean, monitor
   -- not on ASA or plavix, likely [**2-10**] h/o GIB
   .
   # anemia - unknown baseline. Normocytic. Iron studies c/w anemia of
   chronic disease. Also Guaiac positive. HCT decreased today , may be
   seoncdray to component of hemodilution as well.
   -- trend HCT, will recheck with pm labs
   .
   # Renal Insufficiency - unknown chronicity. Was 0.6 in [**2174**]. Uine lytes
   were c/w prerenal so given bolus x 2 and CXR appeasr slightly fluid
   overloaded on CXR
   -- hold ACE-I
   -- renally dose medications
   .
   # HTN - home regimen is ACE-I and BB
   -- hold ACE-I given renal failure and hyperkalemia
   -- continue metoprolol at lower dose for now, may need to increase to
   home dose
   .
   # Hyponatremia - mild, may be due to prerenal insufficiency given
   elevated creatinine and relartively dry MM, improved later this am,
   normalized at 137
   -- trend
   .
   # Seizure disorder
   -- phenobarb level therapeutic, continue home regimen
   -- avoid fluoroquinolones to not lower sz threshold

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. She is being weaned off
   sedation, currently on 25 Fentanyl, off Versed. No relative hypoxia nor
   [**Name (NI) **] gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary
   process causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for
   infxn but afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather
   than true pneumonia.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given fever, ? infiltrate vs. effusion R base
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- cycled cardiac enzymes, ? EKG changes but are stable compared with
   prior so unlikely
   -- wean O2 and change to PSV as tolerated
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Wean off vent as tolerated but currently requiring pressure support

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral vascular disease, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure likely due to aspiration. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a recent increase in blood pressure and a decrease in fluid balance. Her laboratory results show anemia, renal insufficiency, hypertension, and hyponatremia, with an elevated INR. She has a history of seizure disorder and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not improve on mechanical ventilation, and may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and she is at risk of developing pneumonia, particularly given her history of aspiration and respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory failure and lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she continues to experience blood loss or hemodilution, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency may worsen if she does not receive adequate fluid management and may require further interventions such as dialysis.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if she does not receive adequate treatment, and may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if she does not receive adequate treatment, and may increase her risk of seizures and other neurological complications.
8. Seizure Disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen if she does not receive adequate treatment, and may increase her risk of further seizures and neurological complications.
9. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may worsen if she does not receive adequate treatment, and may increase her risk of bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean the patient off sedation as tolerated.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
4. Evaluate the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management and medication dosing as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust medication dosing as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's hyponatremia and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue treatment for the patient's seizure disorder and monitor for further seizures.
9. Monitor the patient's elevated INR and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. No relative hypoxia nor [**Name (NI) **]
   gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary process
   causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for infxn but
   afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather than true
   pneumonia.  Has been weaned off of sedation and is satting well on PSV.
   Has sputum gram stain showing 4+ GPC p/c/c.  Mental status appears to
   be at or near her baseline.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given previous fevers, ? of PNA on xray, and now 4+ GPC p/c/c.
   Will continue until culture data and speciation returns.
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Will try to extubate today, given her hypertension, will treat her
   with hydralazine first, and have Nitroglycerin at the bedside.
   -- Discussed with daughter extubation and plan is to reintubate if
   necessary.
   .
   # DM2
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- fixed and SS insulin, FSQ qid, continue TF diet
   .
   # PVD
   -- stumps appear clean, monitor
   -- not on ASA or plavix, likely [**2-10**] h/o GIB
   .
   # Anemia - unknown baseline. Normocytic. Iron studies c/w anemia of
   chronic disease. Also Guaiac positive. HCT decreased today , may be
   seoncdray to component of hemodilution as well. HCts stable now.
   -- trend HCT
   .
   # Renal Insufficiency - unknown chronicity. Was 0.6 in [**2174**]. Urine
   lytes were c/w prerenal so given bolus x 2 and CXR appeasr slightly
   fluid overloaded on CXR. Cr has been stable here 1.9, 2.0, 1.9.
   -- Given her hypertension, will restart her on her home dose of
   Lisinopril 5mg QD
   -- cont to trend Cr and  renally dose medications
   .
   # HTN - home regimen is ACE-I and BB
   -- restart lisinopril 5mg QD.
   -- Metroprolol change from 150 [**Hospital1 **], to 100 TID to give her better
   coverage during the day
   .
   # Hyponatremia - mild, may be due to prerenal insufficiency given
   elevated creatinine and relartively dry MM, improved later yesterday
   am, normalized at 137, has stayed constant at 138.
   -- trend
   .
   # Seizure disorder
   -- phenobarb level therapeutic, continue home regimen
   -- avoid fluoroquinolones to not lower sz threshold
   .
   # Elevated INR - Likely due to poor nutritional status, though trial of
   Vitamin K po 10mg x1 did not have significant improvement yesterday.
   -- Will check Fibrinogen and FDPs today
   -- Check LFTs,
   -- Repeat Vitamin K 10mg PO

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on respiratory support, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and the possibility of reintubation is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of fevers, and the sputum culture shows 4+ GPC p/c/c, which may indicate sepsis. The patient's temperature is currently afebrile, but the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out.
3. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows 4+ GPC p/c/c, which may indicate pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and the possibility of pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
5. Vascular Complications: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and is at risk of developing vascular complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the possibility of renal insufficiency or failure cannot be ruled out.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are mildly decreased, which may be due to prerenal insufficiency or other underlying medical conditions.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreased, and the possibility of anemia cannot be ruled out.
9. Elevated INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, which may be due to poor nutritional status or other underlying medical conditions.
10. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and the possibility of seizure activity cannot be ruled out.
11. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and the possibility of hypertension-related complications cannot be ruled out.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, monitor the patient's respiratory status, and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, currently receiving ICU care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, and blood pressure of 183/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 340 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin-T levels. The patient's creatinine and lactate levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney and metabolic dysfunction.

The patient's physical examination is stable, with no significant changes noted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, including respiratory arrest, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and lactate levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which can lead to further complications, including fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate level and decreased pH suggest the possibility of metabolic acidosis, which can lead to further complications, including cardiovascular instability and neurological dysfunction.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and decreased blood pressure suggest the possibility of cardiac dysfunction, which can lead to further complications, including cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias.
6. Bleeding risk: The patient's elevated platelet count and potential coagulopathy (as indicated by the elevated PT and PTT) suggest the possibility of bleeding risk, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and potential sepsis suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to further complications, including organ dysfunction and failure.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further deterioration and ensure the patient's optimal outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds now
   admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia and progression to
   respiratory failure.  Certainly patient does have clear risk for and
   evidence of aspiration event with possible plugging of airways leading
   to acute changes with rapid improvement in oxygenation.
   1)Acute Respiratory Failure- DDX aspiration based on story.
   -Wean FIO2,on PSV but needs sig pressure to maintain volumes. Inc
   compliance due to non cardiogenic edema in setting of evolving
   pneumonitis. Rx with ABX for possible aspiration event
Vanco/Zosyn
   -Will rule out for MI with CK serially given concern with ECG subtle
   changes and troponin elevation.
   2)Acute Renal Failure -This is suggested by the elevation in serum
   creatinine although true baseline needs to be established
   -FENa -renal azotemia
   -F/U Cr and UOP-Renal dose all meds
   3)Diabetes
will need insulin sliding scale as is poorly controlled in
   the setting of acute illness.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds now
   admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia and progression to
   respiratory failure.  Certainly patient does have clear risk for and
   evidence of aspiration event with possible plugging of airways leading
   to acute changes with rapid improvement in oxygenation.
   1)Acute Respiratory Failure- DDX aspiration based on story.
   -Wean FIO2,on PSV but needs sig pressure to maintain volumes. Inc
   compliance due to non cardiogenic edema in setting of evolving
   pneumonitis. Rx with ABX for possible aspiration event
Vanco/Zosyn
   -Will rule out for MI with CK serially given concern with ECG subtle
   changes and troponin elevation.
   2)Acute Renal Failure -This is suggested by the elevation in serum
   creatinine although true baseline needs to be established
   -FENa -renal azotemia
   -F/U Cr and UOP-Renal dose all meds
   3)Diabetes
will need insulin sliding scale as is poorly controlled in
   the setting of acute illness.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds, admitted with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 63 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 183/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 340 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O. The patient is also receiving oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.1-11.0 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.1-24.9%
* Platelet count: 172-140 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.9-2.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.39-0.30 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 565 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and diabetes. The patient is at risk for aspiration due to her dementia and chronic G-tube feeds, and has evidence of aspiration on her chest radiograph.

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning FiO2 on PSV mode
* Monitoring for signs of aspiration
* Ruling out myocardial infarction with serial CK levels and troponin elevation
* Managing acute renal failure with fluid management and medication dose adjustments
* Managing diabetes with insulin sliding scale
* Prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and chronic G-tube feeds, admitted to the ICU with acute onset of fever, hypoxemia, and progression to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 63 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 183/54 mmHg (85/39 mmHg - 185/68 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute (RR)
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.1-11.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 172-146 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.9-2.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.39-0.30 ng/mL
* TCO2: 21-24 mmHg
* Glucose: 334-148 mg/dL
* Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Endotracheal tube
* Ventilator mode: CPAP/PSV
* Vt (Spontaneous): 340-392 mL
* PS: 10 cmH2O
* RR (Spontaneous): 14
* PEEP: 5 cmH2O
* FiO2: 40%
* RSBI: 55

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL
* Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, Endotracheal tube
* Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal)
* Respiratory/Chest: (Breath Sounds: Clear)
* Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, g tube
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Responds to voice

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's risk factors and evidence of aspiration event
* Nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia and hypotension
* Hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes and stress of acute illness
* Sepsis due to potential bacterial infections
* Pulmonary embolism due to immobility and risk factors

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue antibiotics and antifungals as ordered
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly
* Continue respiratory support and monitor for signs of respiratory failure
* Monitor for signs of acute kidney injury and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin sliding scale as needed
* Continue prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's 24-hour events include re-intubation after extubation due to increasing hypertension, which was managed with nitroglycerine and hydralazine. The patient had a large bowel movement, which resulted in decreased blood pressure. The patient has a history of MRSA infection, and cultures have grown 4+ MRSA on VANC/ZOSYN.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 66 bpm (58-90 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 183/66 mmHg (94-204/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.1-7.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.1-22.5%
* Platelet count: 172-140 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.9-1.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.39-0.30 ng/mL
* TCO2: 21-25 mmHg
* Glucose: 3.8 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination is notable for the following:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, and tone not assessed

The patient's lab results are consistent with a septic shock, and the patient's hypertension and tachycardia are likely secondary to the infection. The patient's blood cultures have grown MRSA, which is a common pathogen in ICU patients. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the patient's glucose level is slightly elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Hypotension and shock
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Pancreatitis

The patient's treatment plan should focus on managing the sepsis, controlling hypertension, and providing supportive care to maintain organ function."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with dementia, DM2, and PVD now admitted with respiratory
   failure in setting of probable aspiration.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure - DDx includes aspiration pneumonitis vs
   aspiration PNA, ACS, PE, PTX, infection/sepsis, medications/overdose,
   hypoglycemia or seizure. ACS ruled out with biomarkers trending down,
   no elevated CKMB, no acute ECG changes. No relative hypoxia nor [**Name (NI) **]
   gradient (PAO2 410 on 100% FiO2)  argues against any primary process
   causing ongoing V/Q mismatch. Initial fever concerning for infxn but
   afebrile here. Fever may have been [**2-10**] pneumonitis rather than true
   pneumonia.  Has been weaned off of sedation and is satting well on PSV.
   Has sputum gram stain showing 4+ GPC p/c/c.  Mental status appears to
   be at or near her baseline.
   -- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn for now in case
   of HCAP given previous fevers, ? of PNA on xray, and now 4+ GPC p/c/c.
   Will continue until culture data and speciation returns.
   -- F/U cultures: sputum culture, U/A and culture, blood cultures
   -- VAP bundle
   -- Will try to extubate today, given her hypertension, will treat her
   with hydralazine first, and have Nitroglycerin at the bedside.
   -- Discussed with daughter extubation and plan is to reintubate if
   necessary.
   .
   # DM2
   -- hold oral hypoglycemics
   -- fixed and SS insulin, FSQ qid, continue TF diet
   .
   # PVD
   -- stumps appear clean, monitor
   -- not on ASA or plavix, likely [**2-10**] h/o GIB
   .
   # Anemia - unknown baseline. Normocytic. Iron studies c/w anemia of
   chronic disease. Also Guaiac positive. HCT decreased today , may be
   seoncdray to component of hemodilution as well. HCts stable now.
   -- trend HCT
   .
   # Renal Insufficiency - unknown chronicity. Was 0.6 in [**2174**]. Urine
   lytes were c/w prerenal so given bolus x 2 and CXR appeasr slightly
   fluid overloaded on CXR. Cr has been stable here 1.9, 2.0, 1.9.
   -- Given her hypertension, will restart her on her home dose of
   Lisinopril 5mg QD
   -- cont to trend Cr and  renally dose medications
   .
   # HTN - home regimen is ACE-I and BB
   -- restart lisinopril 5mg QD.
   -- Metroprolol change from 150 [**Hospital1 **], to 100 TID to give her better
   coverage during the day
   .
   # Hyponatremia - mild, may be due to prerenal insufficiency given
   elevated creatinine and relartively dry MM, improved later yesterday
   am, normalized at 137, has stayed constant at 138.
   -- trend
   .
   # Seizure disorder
   -- phenobarb level therapeutic, continue home regimen
   -- avoid fluoroquinolones to not lower sz threshold
   .
   # Elevated INR - Likely due to poor nutritional status, though trial of
   Vitamin K po 10mg x1 did not have significant improvement yesterday.
   -- Will check Fibrinogen and FDPs today
   -- Check LFTs,
   -- Repeat Vitamin K 10mg PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 90-year-old female with dementia, DM2, and PVD, was admitted with respiratory failure in the setting of probable aspiration. She was intubated and received broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for possible HCAP and pneumonia. Her mental status appears to be at or near her baseline.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 183/66 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy with a face tent and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, likely due to chronic disease, with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. Her blood sugar levels are under control, and she is receiving insulin therapy.

The patient's medical conditions include DM2, PVD, and hypertension, which is being treated with lisinopril 5mg QD. She has a history of seizure disorder and is receiving phenobarb therapy.

The patient's ICU care plan includes continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, weaning off sedation, and attempting extubation today. She will receive hydralazine and nitroglycerin to treat hypertension. If extubation fails, reintubation will be considered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring increased ventilatory support or reintubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, requiring dialysis or adjustment of medications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, requiring further medication adjustments or consideration of additional antihypertensive agents.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen, requiring adjustments to her medication regimen or consideration of additional anticonvulsants.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring transfusions or adjustments to her medication regimen.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, requiring further monitoring and treatment.
8. Infection: The patient may develop additional infections, such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections, which can complicate her care and increase her risk of mortality.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral vascular disease admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration. The patient was previously intubated but was extubated and is now on 2L nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), anemia, and renal insufficiency. The patient's creatinine levels have been stable, and her blood pressure has been controlled with medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonitis make her susceptible to developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate potential acute kidney injury.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and decreased liver function may lead to hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and use of anticoagulant medications make her susceptible to gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's anemia and renal insufficiency may lead to electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.
8. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection.
9. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and decreased liver function may lead to hepatic failure.
10. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonitis make her susceptible to developing respiratory failure.

To address these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Continued monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and radiological studies.
2. Antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
3. Anticoagulant therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
4. Management of hypertension and hyperglycemia.
5. Nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance.
6. Monitoring of liver function and electrolyte levels.
7. Prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Respiratory support to prevent respiratory failure.

The patient's daughter has been informed of the patient's condition and treatment plan, and the patient's code status is full code."

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 924**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care. I would add or emphasize the
   following:  The patient continues to do well following yesterday
   extubation.  She is being treated for a [**Hospital 1684**] healthcare associated
   pneumonia with vancomycin.  She remains unresponsive, quite like what I
   am to believe has been her nursing home baseline.  Her LFTs are now
   elevated and rising, and GI has been consulted.  The differential
   includes
shock
 liver (her BP had been documented to be low), drug
   induced (hydralazine), viral, etc.  We will aim to keep her
   normotensive, stop hydralazine, and we are checking viral serologies.
   Despite her limited level of functioning and prognosis, she remains a
   full code for the present.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 924**]
s note above and
   agree with the findings and plan of care. I would add or emphasize the
   following:  The patient continues to do well following yesterday
   extubation.  She is being treated for a [**Hospital 1684**] healthcare associated
   pneumonia with vancomycin.  She remains unresponsive, quite like what I
   am to believe has been her nursing home baseline.  Her LFTs are now
   elevated and rising, and GI has been consulted.  The differential
   includes
shock
 liver (her BP had been documented to be low), drug
   induced (hydralazine), viral, etc.  We will aim to keep her
   normotensive, stop hydralazine, and we are checking viral serologies.
   Despite her limited level of functioning and prognosis, she remains a
   full code for the present.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and peripheral vascular disease, admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure in the setting of probable aspiration. She was extubated and is currently on 2L nasal cannula oxygen. Her sputum culture grew 4+ MRSA, and she is being treated with vancomycin. Her laboratory results show elevated LFTs, anemia, and renal insufficiency. She has a history of hypertension, and her current BP is in the 200s/110s. She is also experiencing hyponatremia and has a seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew 4+ MRSA, and she is being treated with vancomycin. However, the culture is pending, and the patient's response to treatment is uncertain.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, and she may require further respiratory support.
3. Elevated LFTs: The patient's LFTs are elevated and rising, and the differential diagnosis includes viral infection, toxic damage, and ischemia.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is normocytic, and iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is 1.9, and she has a history of hypertension.
6. Hypertension: The patient's BP is in the 200s/110s, and she is being treated with lisinopril and metoprolol.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 138, and it may be due to prerenal insufficiency.
8. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and her phenobarb level is therapeutic.
9. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, and it may be due to poor nutritional status.
10. FEN: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, and she is at risk for malnutrition.
11. PVD: The patient has a history of PVD, and her stumps appear clean.
12. Code Status: The patient is a full code, but her daughter has expressed concerns about remaining intubated for an extended period.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infection with vancomycin and monitor her response to treatment.
3. Monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Continue to treat the patient's anemia and renal insufficiency with supportive care.
5. Monitor the patient's BP and adjust her antihypertensive medications as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's sodium level and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure disorder and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's INR and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
10. Monitor the patient's PVD and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
11. Continue to monitor the patient's code status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."
