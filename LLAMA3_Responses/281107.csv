You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of pneumonia. They have been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and aztreonam, and have been mechanically ventilated with high-flow nasal oxygen. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 94% on high-flow nasal oxygen. They have a history of desaturating to the high 80s, but this has improved with the current oxygen therapy.

The patient's lab results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 244 K/uL. Their liver enzymes are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 42 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 9 IU/L. Their lactate level is slightly elevated at 1.2 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory failure could lead to further decline in lung function, potentially requiring more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and mild thrombocytopenia could increase their risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Bleeding: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia could increase their risk of bleeding, particularly if they require invasive procedures or have a coagulopathy.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes could indicate hepatic dysfunction, which could worsen their overall prognosis.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis could lead to renal dysfunction, potentially requiring dialysis.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, lab results, and clinical status closely, and to adjust their treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient has been experiencing frequent desaturations to high 80s, which has been addressed by performing ABG tests. The patient has also been experiencing hypoglycemia, with a blood glucose level of 38. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles throughout the lungs, normoactive bowel sounds, and soft, mild tenderness over the right side of the abdomen and epigastric region. The patient's skin is warm and well-perfused, with no rashes or edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 244 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 42 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 81 IU/L. The patient's troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and their lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's frequent desaturations to high 80s and bilateral crackles throughout the lungs suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level of 38 is a significant concern, and the patient may require continuous glucose monitoring and frequent blood glucose checks to prevent further hypoglycemic episodes.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver function tests suggest a possible septic response, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's diagnosis of pneumonia other than ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests a high risk of pneumonia-related complications, such as respiratory failure and sepsis.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver function tests suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's soft, mild tenderness over the right side of the abdomen and epigastric region suggests a possible gastrointestinal bleed, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, metabolic, and infectious conditions to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: Productive sputum, fevers ,
   leukocytosis, cough and marked shortness of breath with desaturations
   to the 70s range on room air are all concerning for PNA. CXR shows
   bilateral edema with elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports an
   additional component of CHF exacerbation, likely prompted in setting of
   recent infection. Given her marked desaturations on room air and very
   high LDH, PCP is certainly in the differential here as well. Although
   she has perisistent elevated LDH levels in setting of her chronic
   pancreatitis. LDH can also be elevated in pulmonary infarction as well
   and patient has history of prior splenic vein thrombosis. Thus, PE is
   also on differential at this time.  Respiratory viral  culture:
   negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 9640**]: negative, legionella antigen: negative, HIV:
   negative
   .
   -continue on Vancomycin/Levaquin /Aztreonam
   -f/u sputum culture
   -STAT ABG
   -check urine legionella, check resp viral panel
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   .
   #Leukocytosis - WBC elevated to 14.3 with left shift. Likely etiology
   is PNA in setting of aforementioned symptoms of cough, fevers,
   productive sputum and dyspnea. Will also need to follow up urine
   culture as well given some small amount of WBCs & bacteria.
   .
   --continue Vancomycin, Levaquin, Aztreonam for CAP coverage
   --follow-up blood and urine cultures
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.
   .
   --will give lasix IV tonight, monitor UOP
   --f/up TTE
   --low Na diet
   --continue to trend 2 total sets of cardiac enzymes
   --continue on beta blocker and HTN medications once BPs improve
   (holding now in setting of SBPs in low 100 range)
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Glucose in 60s
   in ED in setting of poor PO intake. Low blood glucose in AM. On 28 of
   Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   .
   -QID fingersticks
   -continue on [**3-8**] basal glargine dose due to poor PO
   -continue on overlapping QID humalog SSI coverage PRN
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   .
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #.Anemia -Chronic in nature. Hct is 33.9 now and near usual baseline
   Hct in the 30-33 range.
   .
   --continue to trend Hcts
   --transfuse for Hct <21 or >7 point Hct drop
   --will check stool guiacs
   --add on iron studies
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: Productive sputum, fevers ,
   leukocytosis, cough and marked shortness of breath with desaturations
   to the 70s range on room air are all concerning for PNA. CXR shows
   bilateral edema with elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports an
   additional component of CHF exacerbation, likely prompted in setting of
   recent infection. Given her marked desaturations on room air and very
   high LDH, PCP is certainly in the differential here as well. Although
   she has perisistent elevated LDH levels in setting of her chronic
   pancreatitis. LDH can also be elevated in pulmonary infarction as well
   and patient has history of prior splenic vein thrombosis. Thus, PE is
   also on differential at this time.  Respiratory viral  culture:
   negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 9640**]: negative, legionella antigen: negative, HIV:
   negative
   .
   -continue on Vancomycin/Levaquin /Aztreonam
   -f/u sputum culture
   -STAT ABG
   -check urine legionella, check resp viral panel
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   .
   #Leukocytosis - WBC elevated to 14.3 with left shift. Likely etiology
   is PNA in setting of aforementioned symptoms of cough, fevers,
   productive sputum and dyspnea. Will also need to follow up urine
   culture as well given some small amount of WBCs & bacteria.
   .
   --continue Vancomycin, Levaquin, Aztreonam for CAP coverage
   --follow-up blood and urine cultures
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.
   .
   --will give lasix IV tonight, monitor UOP
   --f/up TTE
   --low Na diet
   --continue to trend 2 total sets of cardiac enzymes
   --continue on beta blocker and HTN medications once BPs improve
   (holding now in setting of SBPs in low 100 range)
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Glucose in 60s
   in ED in setting of poor PO intake. Low blood glucose in AM. On 28 of
   Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   .
   -QID fingersticks
   -continue on [**3-8**] basal glargine dose due to poor PO
   -continue on overlapping QID humalog SSI coverage PRN
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   .
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #.Anemia -Chronic in nature. Hct is 33.9 now and near usual baseline
   Hct in the 30-33 range.
   .
   --continue to trend Hcts
   --transfuse for Hct <21 or >7 point Hct drop
   --will check stool guiacs
   --add on iron studies
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 48-year-old female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, and anemia, presents with pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF), and hypoglycemia. She has been experiencing shortness of breath, hypoxia, and desaturations to the 70s range on room air. Her laboratory results show elevated BNP, leukocytosis, and high LDH levels. She is receiving antibiotics and diuretics, and her blood glucose levels are being monitored.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient's symptoms of cough, fevers, and productive sputum, along with the radiological findings of bilateral infiltrates, suggest a diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires close monitoring to prevent respiratory failure.
2. **Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Heart Failure (CHF):** The patient's elevated BNP levels and radiological findings of bilateral edema suggest CHF exacerbation. The patient's heart failure is likely triggered by the recent infection. Close monitoring of her cardiac status is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. **Hypoglycemia:** The patient's low blood glucose levels in the 60s and 70s, especially in the setting of poor PO intake, suggest hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of her blood glucose levels and adjustment of her insulin regimen are necessary to prevent further hypoglycemia.
4. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's elevated WBC count and left shift suggest a bacterial infection, which may be contributing to her pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
5. **Diabetes Complications:** The patient's history of insulin-dependent diabetes and chronic pancreatitis puts her at risk for diabetes-related complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia.
6. **Pancreatitis:** The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis may be contributing to her pancreatic enzyme deficiencies and malabsorption.
7. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient's history of prior splenic vein thrombosis and her current symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia suggest the possibility of PE. Further evaluation with imaging studies is necessary to rule out this diagnosis.
8. **Depression:** The patient's history of depressive symptoms and her current flattened affect suggest the possibility of depression. Close monitoring of her mental status and adjustment of her antidepressant regimen are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

In conclusion, the patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status. The potential medical complications listed above must be considered and addressed to prevent further deterioration and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with

   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: Productive sputum, fevers ,
   leukocytosis, cough and marked shortness of breath with desaturations
   to the 70s range on room air are all concerning for PNA. CXR shows
   bilateral edema with elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports an
   additional component of CHF exacerbation, likely prompted in setting of
   recent infection. Given her marked desaturations on room air and very
   high LDH, PCP is certainly in the differential here as well. Although
   she has perisistent elevated LDH levels in setting of her chronic
   pancreatitis. LDH can also be elevated in pulmonary infarction as well

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient, a 48-year-old female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, and longstanding anemia, is currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and sepsis. She has been experiencing shortness of breath, hypoxia, and fevers, with bilateral pulmonary edema and patchy infiltrates on CXR. Her laboratory results show elevated BNP, leukocytosis, and a high LDH level, which may indicate pulmonary infarction or pulmonary embolism (PE) as well.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles throughout the lungs, a normal sinus rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Her abdomen is soft, with mild tenderness over the right side.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and troponin T levels, which may indicate sepsis or cardiac injury. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, levaquin, and aztreonam for coverage of pneumonia, as well as lasix for diuresis and beta blockers for hypertension control. She is also receiving insulin for glycemic control and supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease with meals for chronic pancreatitis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's history of prior splenic vein thrombosis and elevated LDH levels, PE is a potential concern.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and troponin T levels may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of mortality.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's history of insulin-dependent diabetes and poor oral intake may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to pancreatic necrosis and increased risk of sepsis.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve her chances of recovery."

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary
   processes. CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia, CHF exacerbation, and fevers. The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath, hypoxia, and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her SpO2 is 94%. Her lab results show a WBC count of 14.6, Hct of 31.0, and platelet count of 244.

The patient's medical conditions include pneumonia, CHF, IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and anemia. She has been treated with antibiotics, supportive therapy, and diuretics. The patient's clinical picture is consistent with infectious, viral, or fungal etiology, and other considerations include acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's CHF exacerbation and elevated BNP may lead to cardiac failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and fevers may lead to infection, which can spread to other parts of the body.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and acute drop in Hct may indicate hemorrhage into the lungs or other body cavities.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's IDDM and low blood glucose in the morning may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis and abdominal pain may lead to pancreatitis, which can be life-threatening.
7. Hypertension: The patient's HTN and elevated blood pressure may lead to hypertensive crisis, which can be life-threatening.
8. Depression: The patient's history of depressive symptoms and flattened affect on exam may indicate depression, which can lead to suicidal ideation or behavior.
9. Tobacco use: The patient's smoking and nicotine patch use may lead to nicotine dependence and addiction.
10. Inadequate pain control: The patient's chronic abdominal pain and pain control with PRN Percocet may lead to inadequate pain control, which can worsen the patient's condition.

In conclusion, the patient's complex medical conditions and potential complications require close monitoring and management by the healthcare team to prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary processes
   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum
   negative (poor sample).
   - will send out for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2) / Levaquin (Day 2) / Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   BPs improving now.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, and longstanding anemia. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and diffuse pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on a high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of smoking and is currently smoking 1 packet per day. She has been prescribed nicotine patches as needed.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 244 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 784 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse pulmonary edema, and her computed tomography (CT) scan shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, levaquin, and aztreonam, and her antibiotic therapy will be continued for at least 48 hours. She is also receiving supportive therapy, including oxygen supplementation and diuretic therapy.

The patient's anemia is chronic, and her hemoglobin level is currently at baseline. She is being followed daily for any changes in her anemia.

The patient's CHF exacerbation is likely triggered by her pneumonia and URI, and she is being treated with diuretic therapy and low-sodium diet.

The patient's insulin-dependent diabetes is well-controlled, and she is being monitored for any changes in her blood glucose levels.

The patient's chronic pancreatitis is well-controlled, and she is being managed with pain control medications and supplemental enzymes.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and she is being monitored for any changes in her blood pressure.

The patient's depression is stable, and she is being monitored for any changes in her mental status.

The patient's tobacco use history is significant, and she is being encouraged to quit smoking.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and CHF exacerbation can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's CHF exacerbation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
* Infection: The patient's pneumonia and antibiotic therapy can increase the risk of infection.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and antibiotic therapy can increase the risk of bleeding.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin-dependent diabetes and antibiotic therapy can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension and diuretic therapy can increase the risk of hypertension.
* Depression: The patient's depression can worsen with stress and hospitalization, which can increase the risk of suicidal ideation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medication therapy to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary
   processes. CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s. Sputum negative (poor sample).
   - f/u CXR
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2)/Levaquin (Day 2) /Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - consider decreased in SS?
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary
   processes. CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s. Sputum negative (poor sample).
   - f/u CXR
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2)/Levaquin (Day 2) /Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - consider decreased in SS?
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, and longstanding anemia. She was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and diffuse pulmonary edema on chest X-ray consistent with chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and pneumonia (PNA). The patient has been receiving antibiotic and supportive therapy, but her hypoxemia persists.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on high-flow nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes a high-flow nasal cannula and a facemask, with a plan to wean FiO2 as tolerated.

The patient has a history of chronic anemia, with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of 30-33%. Her current Hct is 31%, which is within her baseline range.

The patient has been diagnosed with CHF exacerbation, which is likely triggered by new PNA/URI. She has responded well to furosemide 10 mg bolus and has been prescribed Lasix 10 mg PO daily. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to assess her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and diastolic function.

The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, with well-controlled blood glucose levels. She is currently receiving Lantus 28 units at night and a sliding scale insulin regimen.

The patient has chronic pancreatitis, with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology. She has normal lipase levels and is managed with pain control using PRN Percocet and supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease with meals.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which appears well-controlled with amlodipine, atenolol, and lisinopril. However, these medications are being held to allow for more room for diuresis.

The patient has a history of depression, with a slightly flattened affect on examination. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation and has a stable mental health status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure, sepsis, or even death.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF may worsen, leading to increased symptoms, decreased cardiac function, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, fatigue, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes may worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening complication.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to increased cardiovascular risk, stroke, or heart failure.
7. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen, leading to decreased quality of life, increased risk of suicide, or other mental health complications.

Based on this information, I recommend close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent or manage them."

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with history of chronic pancreatitis and now admitted with
   hypoxemia and respiratory distress now with some improvement across the
   past 24 hours.  She still maintains significant A-a gradient hypoxemia
   and desaturations with exertion.
   1)Hypoxemia-The differential diagnosis for this is
   extensive
certainly
we have hypoxemic respiratory compromise secondary
   to diffuse interstitial lung disease with acute onset.-->
   PULMONARY EDEMA--Hydrostatic or non-hydorstatic is most likely source
   for significant changes over past 24 hours.  The notion of purely
   hydrostatic edema seems less likely.  There is certainly possible
   trigger of toxic inhalation, infection, idiopathic pneumonitis without
   clear source identified.
   PNEUMONIA-Possible and continued with Vanco/Levoflox/Aztreonam but this
   would be atypical
viral scan has been negative to date, no atypical
   bacteria identified, PCP in the setting of negative HIV is less likely.
   PNEUMONITIS--Aspriation possible, AIP, Hypersensitivity, toxic
   inhalation are possible.
   HEMORRHAGE less likely.
   -Would favor maintenance or even to negative fluid balance
   -Will continue with ABX
   -Will provide intubation if clinical worsening seen
   -Will need to consider bronchoscopy with BAL for possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 9657**] have [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, RF
   -Mycoplasma
Ig pending
   -PCP would be deserving of evaluation and would favor further sampling
   as possible with induced sputum being low yield and will trial empiric
   Rx and BAL if worsening
   -Will maintain even and negative fluid balance
   -Will hold on steroids with DIP perhaps most likely at this time and
   have initial improvement.
   -At this time risk of biopsy is excessive in the setting of some
   clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   48 yo female with history of chronic pancreatitis and now admitted with
   hypoxemia and respiratory distress now with some improvement across the
   past 24 hours.  She still maintains significant A-a gradient hypoxemia
   and desaturations with exertion.
   1)Hypoxemia-The differential diagnosis for this is
   extensive
certainly
we have hypoxemic respiratory compromise secondary
   to diffuse interstitial lung disease with acute onset.-->
   PULMONARY EDEMA--Hydrostatic or non-hydorstatic is most likely source
   for significant changes over past 24 hours.  The notion of purely
   hydrostatic edema seems less likely.  There is certainly possible
   trigger of toxic inhalation, infection, idiopathic pneumonitis without
   clear source identified.
   PNEUMONIA-Possible and continued with Vanco/Levoflox/Aztreonam but this
   would be atypical
viral scan has been negative to date, no atypical
   bacteria identified, PCP in the setting of negative HIV is less likely.
   PNEUMONITIS--Aspriation possible, AIP, Hypersensitivity, toxic
   inhalation are possible.
   HEMORRHAGE less likely.
   -Would favor maintenance or even to negative fluid balance
   -Will continue with ABX
   -Will provide intubation if clinical worsening seen
   -Will need to consider bronchoscopy with BAL for possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 9657**] have [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, RF

   -PCP would be deserving of evaluation and would favor further sampling
   as possible with induced sputum being low yield and will trial empiric
   Rx and BAL if worsening
   -Will maintain even and negative fluid balance
   -Will hold on steroids with DIP perhaps most likely at this time and
   have initial improvement.

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypoxemia. She has a history of chronic pancreatitis and was recently treated with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Levofloxacin). She is currently receiving oxygen therapy and has shown some improvement in her oxygen saturation over the past 24 hours. However, she still maintains significant A-a gradient hypoxemia and desaturations with exertion.

The patient's physical examination is notable for tachypnea, symmetric chest expansion, and dullness to percussion. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting an inflammatory response. Her imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, are normal.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's hypoxemia includes pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and aspiration. The patient's condition is complicated by the possibility of toxic inhalation, infection, or idiopathic pneumonitis without a clear source identified.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia or pneumonitis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of pneumonia or pneumonitis, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress may be due to pulmonary edema, which could worsen and lead to respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis and current symptoms suggest the possibility of pancreatitis, which could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Based on the patient's condition and the potential complications listed above, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels closely.
2. Continue antibiotics and consider bronchoscopy with BAL for possible PCP.
3. Maintain a negative fluid balance and consider diuretics if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, for signs of infection or inflammation.
5. Consider intubation if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of respiratory failure.
6. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
7. Consider further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate the patient's lungs and pancreas.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust diet as necessary.
9. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the plan as necessary to ensure the best possible outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary processes
   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum
   negative (poor sample).
   - will send out for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2) / Levaquin (Day 2) / Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   BPs improving now.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary processes
   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture

   negative (poor sample).

   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She was admitted with symptoms of SOB, fevers, and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with CHF exacerbation and PNA. She has been treated with antibiotics and supportive therapy, but her hypoxemia persists. Her clinical picture is consistent with an infectious process, possibly bacterial, viral, or fungal. Other considerations include acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and other interstitial pulmonary processes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of SOB, fevers, and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR are consistent with PNA. The possibility of bacterial, viral, or fungal etiology is high, and the patient's continued hypoxemia despite antibiotic and supportive therapy is a concern.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's elevated BNP and CXR findings suggest CHF exacerbation, which may be triggered by new PNA/URI. The patient's response to Lasix 10 bolus is a positive sign, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further decompensation.
3. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia is well-controlled, but the acute drop in Hct reported earlier was likely a lab error. However, the patient's anemia may still be a concern, especially if it worsens or if the patient's hemoglobin drops further.
4. Chronic pancreatitis: The patient's chronic abdominal pain is near usual baseline, and her lipase level is normal. However, the patient's history of chronic pancreatitis may still be a concern, especially if her pain worsens or if she experiences any complications such as pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.
5. HTN: The patient's HTN is well-controlled now, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further exacerbation.
6. Depression: The patient's slightly flattened affect on exam is concerning, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent any suicidal or homicidal ideation.
7. Tobacco use: The patient's smoking history is concerning, and nicotine patch therapy may be necessary to help her quit smoking.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition plan should be tailored to her specific needs, taking into account her chronic pancreatitis and HTN.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored and controlled to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient's PICC line and arterial line should be closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient should receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP to prevent any complications.
5. Communication: The patient's code status and disposition should be clearly communicated to all healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV)..
   Although patient has crackles, edema and elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation
   is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners and Goodpasture
s, although acute
   HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum negative (poor sample).
   - will send out for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) and hypoxemia, with a diagnosis of diffuse interstitial pneumonitis or acute interstitial pneumonia. Chest CT scan shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic heart failure (CHF). Recent echocardiogram showed LVEF >55%, but may have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF. Elevated BNP supports CHF exacerbation triggered by new pneumonia/URI.
* Hematology: The patient has chronic anemia with a baseline Hct of 30-33%. Recent drop in Hct was attributed to a lab error.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has chronic pancreatitis with idiopathic etiology. She is experiencing chronic abdominal pain, which is near usual baseline.
* Endocrine: The patient has insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) and is receiving insulin therapy.
* Infectious disease: The patient has a sputum culture pending, but has been treated with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Aztreonam) for suspected bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and diffuse interstitial pneumonitis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CHF exacerbation may lead to pulmonary edema, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
3. Infections: The patient's chronic pancreatitis and IDDM may increase the risk of infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis may worsen, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
6. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's IDDM may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly if her glucose levels become uncontrolled.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or heart failure.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current conditions, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of smoking and recently increased his smoking due to stress.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Aztreonam, for suspected pneumonia. However, the sputum culture results are pending, and the sample was inadequate. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, amoxicillin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/67 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, suggesting potential cardiac injury.

The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total fluid intake of 2,320 mL and output of 1,100 mL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes pancreatitis, chronic pneumonia, and other conditions. The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Stress ulcer
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
4. Pulmonary embolism
5. Cardiac arrhythmias
6. Sepsis
7. Pancreatitis exacerbation

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition
2. Glycemic control: Insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose levels between 80-120 mg/dL
3. Lines: Arterial line, PICC line, and central venous catheter
4. Prophylaxis: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with famotidine, and DVT prophylaxis with heparin
5. Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and optimize his clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.

   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary processes
   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum
   negative (poor sample).

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, and longstanding anemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 145/67 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.22, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 22 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 106 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 306 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, with a total bilirubin (T Bili) of 0.2 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) of 83 IU/L.

The patient's chest computed tomography (CT) scan shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes, consistent with CAP. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows prominent left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at 4,000 pg/mL, consistent with CHF exacerbation.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic pancreatitis, which is likely contributing to her chronic abdominal pain. She also has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled at present.

The patient's antibiotic therapy includes vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin, which were initiated on admission. She is also receiving supportive therapy, including oxygen, bronchodilators, and diuretics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of her chronic pancreatitis, which could lead to further abdominal pain and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could require mechanical ventilation and potentially lead to multi-organ failure.
3. Worsening of her CHF exacerbation, which could lead to cardiogenic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Development of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
5. Hemodynamic instability, which could require further invasive monitoring and potentially life-saving interventions.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including CAP, CHF exacerbation, and chronic pancreatitis. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve her clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 48-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse interstitial lung disease of acute onset, and a history of chronic pancreatitis. She has been treated with antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Aztreonam, and has shown a reasonable response with improved oxygenation and mild negative fluid balance. The differential diagnosis includes diffuse alveolar damage (DIP)/non-specific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) versus atypical or viral infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's sputum culture results are pending, and there is a risk of secondary infection if not treated promptly.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, which may exacerbate her respiratory failure and increase the risk of complications.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is mild negative, but there is a risk of fluid overload if not monitored closely.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's heart rhythm is normal, but there is a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, particularly if her respiratory failure worsens.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is not fully assessed, and there is a risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, particularly if her oxygenation levels drop.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal examination is normal, but there is a risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, particularly if her pancreatitis worsens.
8. Skin Complications: The patient's skin examination is not fully assessed, and there is a risk of skin complications, such as pressure ulcers or skin infections, particularly if her immobility persists.
9. Infection Control: The patient is at risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly if her immune system is compromised.
10. Delirium: The patient's neurological status is not fully assessed, and there is a risk of delirium, particularly if her oxygenation levels drop or if she experiences pain or discomfort."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of pancreatitis, chronic pneumonia, and other comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 185/89 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula, and they are receiving 4L NC oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as elevated blood glucose and creatinine levels. The patient's electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may lead to hypovolemic shock if not addressed promptly.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula, which may indicate respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which may lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's elevated blood glucose and creatinine levels may indicate metabolic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or acute kidney injury.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time may indicate coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, are abnormal, which may lead to electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Infection: The patient's history of chronic pneumonia and pancreatitis may increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction."

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).

 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).  Currently on 4L NC.
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)

   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia, is being treated in the ICU for SOB, diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema, and suspected inflammatory diseases such as diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The patient is currently on 4L NC, Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Aztreonam, and is being monitored for autoimmune labs and potential pulmonary interstitial disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Interstitial Disease: The patient's symptoms and radiological findings suggest a high likelihood of pulmonary interstitial disease, which can progress to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk of developing hypertensive emergency if not controlled.
3. Chronic Heart Failure: The patient's EKG shows prominent LVH, and her history of HTN and longstanding anemia suggests a high likelihood of chronic heart failure, which can exacerbate her symptoms.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of indwelling lines and tubes.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, which can worsen if not managed properly.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are not well-controlled, and she is at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome if not managed promptly.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not well-controlled, and she is at risk of developing anemia-related complications such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depressive symptoms, which can worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Control the patient's hypertension with medication and lifestyle modifications.
3. Manage the patient's chronic heart failure with diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
5. Manage the patient's anemia with iron supplements and blood transfusions as needed.
6. Provide psychological support to the patient to manage her depressive symptoms.
7. Consider adding dexamethasone to the patient's treatment regimen to manage pulmonary interstitial disease.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her diet as needed to manage her chronic pancreatitis."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).  Currently on 4L NC.
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #HTN
 sbp: 160-180
   --will re-start amlodipine today
   -- re-started lisinopril on [**8-21**].
   --continue to trend BPs
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus
   yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --currently only on lisinopril for BP
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed
   .
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   - ISS and Lantus at night / QID fingersticks
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a complex medical history, including type 1 diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, and anemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR, and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 185/89 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4L NC. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased albumin and total protein levels. Her liver function tests are within normal limits, except for a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase level.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic pancreatitis, which is likely contributing to her current symptoms. She also has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with antihypertensive medications.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, levaquin, aztreonam, furosemide, famotidine, and metoprolol. She is also receiving nicotine patches for tobacco use cessation.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Shortness of breath/hypoxia: The patient will continue to receive supportive therapy and treatment for possible infectious etiologies, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic pathogens.
* Hypertension: The patient will be restarted on amlodipine and lisinopril, and her blood pressure will be closely monitored.
* CHF: The patient's EKG shows prominent LVH, and her BNP level is elevated, suggesting possible diastolic dysfunction. She will be managed with diuretics and continued on lisinopril.
* IDDM: The patient's blood glucose levels will be closely monitored, and she will continue to receive insulin and sliding scale therapy.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia will be closely monitored, and she will continue to receive iron and folic acid supplements.
* Chronic pancreatitis: The patient will continue to receive pain management with PRN Percocet and fentanyl patch, and will continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease with meals.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR may lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's elevated BNP level and prominent LVH on EKG suggest possible diastolic dysfunction, which may lead to cardiac failure if not managed properly.
* Infection: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease may increase her risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
* Diabetes-related complications: The patient's IDDM may lead to complications such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis if not managed properly.
* Anemia-related complications: The patient's anemia may lead to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function if not managed properly.
* Pancreatitis-related complications: The patient's chronic pancreatitis may lead to complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, and fistulas if not managed properly."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).  Currently on 4L NC.
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #HTN
 sbp: 160-180
   --will re-start amlodipine today
   -- re-started lisinopril on [**8-21**].
   --continue to trend BPs
   --will dc a-line today
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus
   yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --currently only on lisinopril for BP
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed
   .
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   - ISS and Lantus at night / QID fingersticks
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).  Currently on 4L NC.
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #HTN
 sbp: 160-180
   --will re-start amlodipine today
   -- re-started lisinopril on [**8-21**].
   --continue to trend BPs
   --will dc a-line today
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus
   yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --currently only on lisinopril for BP
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed
   .
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   - ISS and Lantus at night / QID fingersticks
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
