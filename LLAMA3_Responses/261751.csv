   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Agree with admit note that differential for acute mitral
   regurgitation includes ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated
   wedge pressure, consistent with this finding.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   Pt is now diuresing well after afterload reduction with nitroprusside.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.  Hematocrit decreased to
   23 this morning.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
   - consider increased in Lantus dose vs. insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a living-related kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and developed acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing respiratory support, vasopressor therapy, and diuretic therapy. She has a Swan-Ganz catheter in place to monitor her hemodynamics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ongoing vasopressor therapy, sepsis, or hypoperfusion.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and vasopressor therapy.
3. Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to ongoing sepsis, vasopressor therapy, or pulmonary hypertension.
4. Sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection, including the possibility of endocarditis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration or gastritis.
6. Hyperkalemia due to ongoing kidney dysfunction or vasopressor therapy.
7. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to ongoing cardiac stress and underlying coronary artery disease.
8. Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and ongoing vasopressor therapy.
9. Infection-related complications, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), or catheter-related infections.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring of her vital signs, hemodynamics, and laboratory values. She should be closely monitored for signs of cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Vasopressor therapy should be titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of less than 80 mmHg, while avoiding excessive vasopressor doses that can exacerbate kidney dysfunction. Diuretic therapy should be continued to manage fluid overload and improve renal function. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be adjusted based on the results of blood cultures and urinalysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
s. Likely related to stress dose steroids.
   - starting insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
s. Likely related to stress dose steroids.
   - starting insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease. She has been hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on non-invasive ventilation with a BiPAP mask, with a tidal volume of 832 mL, and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and acute diastolic heart failure. She is receiving nitroprusside for afterload reduction and Lasix for diuresis.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, and her creatinine level has risen. She is receiving pulse steroids and hydrocortisone for possible acute rejection.
* Hematology: The patient has anemia, with a hematocrit level of 23.6%. She is receiving ferrous sulfate and has been given a type and screen for possible procedures.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes, with blood sugars running in the 300s. She is starting insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of acute diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension
* Development of acute kidney injury or failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count of 500 K/uL
* Hypoglycemia due to starting insulin therapy
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppressive therapy and central lines
* Development of respiratory failure requiring intubation
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent these complications and optimize her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # PUMP/Acute diastolic heart failure/Mitral regurgitation/Dsypnea:
   The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, has crackles on exam, and
   TTE shows new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
   Her presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue Lantus 18 units qhs and SSI with qid fingerstick monitoring.
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # PUMP/Acute diastolic heart failure/Mitral regurgitation/Dsypnea:
   The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, has crackles on exam, and
   TTE shows new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
   Her presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue Lantus 18 units qhs and SSI with qid fingerstick monitoring.
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a living-related kidney transplant 10 years ago. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure. Currently, she is in the ICU due to acute diastolic heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her respiratory status is concerning, with crackles present in the mid lung field bilaterally, and she is on non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, likely due to acute rejection or prerenal failure. Her troponin-T levels are slightly elevated, but her EKG is normal. Her liver enzymes are elevated, and her lactate acid level is slightly elevated.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Afterload reduction with nitroprusside to goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 80.
2. Diuresis with Lasix if her urine output does not improve.
3. Holding metoprolol due to acute CHF.
4. Cardiac surgery consultation and consideration of TEE for further evaluation.
5. Renal consultation for possible acute rejection and consideration of ultrasound of the transplanted kidney with Doppler.
6. Continue pulse steroids and hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h.
7. Increase Prograf to 4 mg po bid.
8. Continue Bactrim prophylaxis.
9. Hold gabapentin for now.
10. Monitor potassium levels and give a dose of kayexelate if necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening of acute diastolic heart failure and mitral regurgitation.
2. Acute rejection of the kidney transplant.
3. Prerenal failure or acute tubular necrosis.
4. Pulmonary edema.
5. Respiratory failure.
6. Sepsis or septic shock.
7. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia.
8. Renal failure requiring dialysis.
9. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
10. Respiratory failure requiring intubation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (Type I), pain control (acute and chronic), renal failure (end-stage), and heart failure (diastolic, acute on chronic). The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation, and various medications, including antibiotics, pain management medications, and cardiac medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 146/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a BiPAP mask.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating cardiac damage.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to respond to stimuli, movement, or tone assessments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and oxygen saturation is dependent on the BiPAP mask. Weaning from non-invasive ventilation may be challenging.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated creatinine levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and heart failure diagnosis increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure progression: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may worsen, leading to increased fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose levels may indicate poor glycemic control, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma.
6. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support and potential aspiration risk increase the risk of pneumonia or VAP.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and potential coagulopathy increase the risk of DVT or PE.
8. Stress ulceration: The patient's elevated cortisol levels and potential gastrointestinal bleeding risk increase the risk of stress ulceration.

Further monitoring and management are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # PUMP/Acute diastolic heart failure/Mitral regurgitation/Dsypnea:
   The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, has crackles on exam, and
   TTE shows new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
   Her presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue Lantus 18 units qhs and SSI with qid fingerstick monitoring.
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # PUMP/Acute diastolic heart failure/Mitral regurgitation/Dsypnea:
   The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, has crackles on exam, and
   TTE shows new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
   Her presentation is consistent with acute worsening of her mitral
   regurgiation.  Differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
   - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside (tried nitroglycerin, but did
   not work at max dose) for goal MAP < 80.  Will need to discuss on
   rounds tomorrow the use of nitroprusside in renal failure and need for
   monitoring for toxicity.
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis if her urine output doesn't improve with
   afterload reduction.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Cardiac surgery aware, formal consult in the am.
   - Consider TEE for further evaluation and follow up blood cultures to
   look for evidence of endocarditis.
   - If she were to decomensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary
   hemodynamic support.
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   - Appreciate renal consult.
   - Will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - Per renal, will continue pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg
   IV q8h
   - Will add on tacroliums level tonight and send in the am.
   - NPO after midnight for possible biopsy
   - Per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - Continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Will hold gabapentin for now.
   - Patient was somewhat hyperkalemic, EKG was without changes.  Repeat K
   somewhat lower.  Will give a dose of kayexelate and trend potassium.
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - As above, will rule out for MI as a cause of worsening MR/heart
   failure.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - Holding plavix for now in case she requires surgery to treat her
   mitral regurgitation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - Check a vanc level in the am.
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  She had no clinical evidence of bleeding currently.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - Trend Hct.
   # Diabetes:
   - Continue Lantus 18 units qhs and SSI with qid fingerstick monitoring.
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease, is admitted to the ICU with acute diastolic heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. She has been experiencing worsening dyspnea and has crackles on examination. The patient's creatinine level has risen, making acute rejection a possibility.

The patient is receiving treatment for her conditions, including:

1. Nitroprusside for afterload reduction and goal MAP < 80.
2. Lasix for diuresis if urine output does not improve with afterload reduction.
3. Holding metoprolol due to acute CHF.
4. Cardiac surgery consultation is planned.
5. Consideration of TEE for further evaluation and follow-up blood cultures to look for evidence of endocarditis.
6. If the patient were to decompensate, IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. WBC: 10.1 K/uL
2. Hct: 23.6%
3. Plt: 500 K/uL
4. Cr: 2.4 mg/dL
5. TropT: 0.06 ng/mL
6. TCO2: 27 mmHg
7. Glucose: 360 mg/dL
8. Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.3/26.3/1.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 28//0.06, ALT / AST: 122/54, Alk Phos / T Bili: 443/0.3, Lactic Acid: 1.8 mmol/L, LDH: 179 IU/L, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 4.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute mitral regurgitation leading to pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.
2. Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
3. Development of sepsis or endocarditis.
4. Respiratory failure due to acute diastolic heart failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities.
6. Increased risk of bleeding due to anemia and anticoagulant therapy.
7. Nutritional deficiencies due to anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.

   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin

   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening dyspnea, acute diastolic heart failure, and severe mitral regurgitation. She also has acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis.

The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is elevated, suggesting cyanide toxicity or an intracardiac shunt. An echocardiogram is ordered to evaluate for shunt. The patient's creatinine level rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level, making acute rejection a possibility.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continue hydralazine for afterload reduction
* Lasix 100 mg with metolazone for better diuresis
* Holding metoprolol due to acute CHF
* CT consult for mitral valve replacement
* TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and for ASD
* IABP as a temporary hemodynamic support if decompensates
* Continue hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
* Follow-up tacrolimus level
* Continue tacrolimus 4 mg
* Continue bactrim prophylaxis
* Holding gabapentin
* Appreciate any additional renal recs
* Diuresis as above

Potential Medical Complications:

* Acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation
* Acute renal failure progression
* Cyanide toxicity or intracardiac shunt
* Acute rejection of the transplanted kidney
* Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation
* Coronary artery disease progression
* Septic arthritis of the left ankle
* Anemia
* Diabetes
* Depression

Recommendations:

* Monitor the patient's cardiac and renal function closely
* Adjust the patient's medications and fluid management as needed
* Consider further diagnostic tests to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms
* Continue to provide supportive care, including pain management and glycemic control."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
s. Likely related to stress dose steroids.
   - starting insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a living-related kidney transplant. She has recently been hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Acute diastolic heart failure with severe mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and elevated wedge pressure, which may be caused by ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture.
2. Acute renal failure, which may be caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor forward flow and hypoperfusion, or acute rejection of the transplanted kidney.
3. Hyperkalemia, which may be related to the patient's chronic kidney disease and the use of potassium-sparing diuretics.
4. Elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation, which may suggest cyanide toxicity or an intracardiac shunt.
5. Respiratory distress, which may be related to the patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient is receiving various treatments, including:

1. Nitroprusside for afterload reduction.
2. Lasix gtt for diuresis.
3. Hydralazine for afterload reduction.
4. Tacrolimus level monitoring.
5. Prograf 4 mg PO bid for immunosuppression.
6. Bactrim prophylaxis.
7. Gabapentin hold due to respiratory distress.
8. Insulin gtt for glycemic control.
9. Reglan for gastroparesis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
2. Further decline in renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Hyperkalemia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death.
4. Respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection, particularly bacteremia or endocarditis, which may be related to the patient's central venous catheters or urinary tract catheters.
6. Bleeding complications, particularly due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant medications.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for complications, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-transplant kidney recipient with a history of type I diabetes, chronic pain, end-stage renal disease, and acute diastolic heart failure on chronic heart failure. The patient was started on insulin gtt and Lasix 80 mg IV, and renal recommendations were implemented, including reducing hydrocortisone to 50 mg IV Q8H. The patient's mixed venous saturation is elevated, suggesting cyanide toxicity or intracardiac shunt, and an echo is ordered to evaluate for shunt. The patient's blood sugars are in the 120s with insulin gtt, and the insulin drip was discontinued. The patient was advanced to a regular diet, and their peripheral vascular examination is incomplete.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cyanide toxicity: The elevated mixed venous saturation suggests cyanide toxicity, which can lead to cardiovascular instability, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Intracardiac shunt: The elevated mixed venous saturation also suggests an intracardiac shunt, which can lead to cyanosis, hypoxemia, and heart failure.
3. Heart failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure on chronic heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and acute kidney injury increase the risk of renal complications, including sepsis, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines and arterial lines increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and line infections.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin therapy and regular diet increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurological complications, including seizures and coma.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient's renal failure and use of potassium-sparing medications increase the risk of hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h

   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -started insulin gtt
   -gave Lasix 80 mg IV
   -Renal recs: lasix gtt, reduce hydrocortisone to 50 mg IV Q8H, continue
   Prograf 4 mg PO Q12H at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.
   -Reduced hydrocortisone to 50 mg IV Q8H per renal recs
   -Renal U/S (prelim read): Normal RLQ transplant kidney w/o perinephric
   fluid collection or hydronephrosis. Normal arterial and venous
   waveforms.
   -Checked mixed venous sats, which were elevated to 90s, suggesting
   cyanide toxicity vs. intracardiac shunt. Lack of lactic acidosis argues
   against cyanide toxicity. Ordered echo to evaluate for shunt.
   -3 p.m. Hct 24.3 (stable from 23.6)
   -ID recs: no TEE for now, low threshold to get TEE if patient develops
   positive blood cultures or fever, continue vancomycin (renally dosed)
   -d/c'ed ceftazidime
   -blood sugars in 120s with insulin gtt at 1 units/hr; d/c'ed insulin
   drip; patient getting glargine + sliding scale
   -advanced diet
   -had long run of NSVT at around 5 a.m., Mg 1.8, repleted Mg in spite of
   renal failure

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with a living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with difficulty speaking in full sentences, and has bilateral crackles in the mid-lung field. She is on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy with accessory muscle use.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, as evidenced by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and Swan-Ganz catheter measurements. She is in sinus rhythm on electrocardiogram (EKG).
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level, which may be related to acute rejection, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Infectious: The patient has a recent history of septic arthritis in her left ankle, and is currently being treated with vancomycin.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 23.6%, which is stable.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 1, which is being managed with insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Worsening of acute diastolic heart failure and mitral regurgitation
* Progression of acute renal failure to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection
* Hemorrhagic complications due to coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing diuresis and medication therapy
* Worsening of anemia and potential need for blood transfusions
* Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued therapy for acute diastolic heart failure and mitral regurgitation, including hydralazine and Lasix
* Management of acute renal failure, including hydrocortisone and tacrolimus therapy
* Ongoing antibiotic therapy for septic arthritis and potential sepsis
* Management of anemia with ferrous sulfate and type and screen
* Monitoring of blood sugar levels and adjustment of insulin therapy as needed
* Monitoring of electrolyte levels and adjustment of diuretic therapy as needed

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix gtt not achieving good diuresis; consider metolazone
 if still
   no diuresis, may need to consider CVVH to remove fluir
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - Consider CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TTE with bubble study to evaluate for shunt
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix gtt not achieving good diuresis; consider metolazone
 if still
   no diuresis, may need to consider CVVH to remove fluir
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - Consider CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TTE with bubble study to evaluate for shunt
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease with CABG and PCI, end-stage renal disease with a living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis.

The patient is currently in the ICU with acute diastolic heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. She has a Swan-Ganz catheter in place, which is showing elevated pulmonary artery pressure and wedge pressure consistent with acute mitral regurgitation.

The patient's creatinine level has risen, and tacrolimus levels are undetectable, making acute rejection a possibility. The ultrasound of the transplanted kidney is normal, but the patient's electrolytes are more consistent with pre-renal azotemia.

The patient has a history of septic arthritis in her left ankle, which is currently being treated with vancomycin. She is also experiencing anemia, with a hematocrit level of 25, and is being treated with ferrous sulfate.

The patient's blood sugars are well-controlled, and she is no longer on insulin drip. She is taking a sliding scale of regular insulin and has been advanced to a regular diet.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is being monitored with telemetry. She has a history of coronary artery disease and is taking ASA, Plavix, and atorvastatin.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Acute diastolic heart failure: The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter measurements show elevated pulmonary artery pressure and wedge pressure, which is consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. This may require further treatment with hydralazine, metolazone, or even consideration of mitral valve replacement.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen, and tacrolimus levels are undetectable, making acute rejection a possibility. The patient's electrolytes are more consistent with pre-renal azotemia, which may require further treatment with diuretics and consideration of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is 25, which is below normal. She is being treated with ferrous sulfate, but may require further treatment with blood transfusions or erythropoietin.
4. Septic arthritis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis in her left ankle, which is currently being treated with vancomycin. She may require further treatment with antibiotics and consideration of surgical debridement.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary artery pressure is elevated, which may require further treatment with medications such as bosentan or sildenafil.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple complications, including heart failure, renal failure, anemia, septic arthritis, and pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring and management of these complications are crucial to ensure the patient's optimal care."

   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above

   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious

   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showed new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Her
   presentation is consistent with acute mitral regurgiation.  Agree with
   admit note that differential for acute mitral regurgitation includes
   ischemia, endocarditis, or chordal rupture. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showed PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding.
   - Continue afterload reduction with nitroprusside for now; attempt to
   switch to another afterload reducer (such as hydralazine)
   - Lasix gtt for diuresis; will re-bolus now and then increase gtt rate
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF.
   - Holding on CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] c/s
   - TEE for further eval of valve
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   UOP still has not drastically increased.  Following renal recs:
   - will send urine lytes, urine osm.
   - f/u ultrasound of transplanted kidney with doppler
   - pulse steroids with hyhdrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - tacrolimus level
   - per renal will increase her prograf to 4 mg po bid (she was given 3
   mg of tacrolimus liquid tonight as she was unable to tolerate pills due
   to her respiratory distress)
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - will hold gabapentin for now.
   - trending K, as pt was hyperkalemic yesterday evening
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily and atorvastatin 40 mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   - can likely restart plavix, as pt likely not going to surgery
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - Continue ceftazadine and vancomycin for her planned course (renally
   dosed).  Currently holding vancomycin as her level has been elvated and
   she was given a dose in the ED.
   - f/u vanc level
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 this morning. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen given possible procedures.
   - repeating Hct this afternoon
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars not well-controlled since admission, running
   in the 300
s. Likely related to stress dose steroids.
   - starting insulin gtt
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after a living-related kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure, and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's current medications include:

* Prograf (tacrolimus) 3 mg daily
* Furosemide (Lasix) 100 mg every 12 hours
* Hydralazine for afterload reduction
* Metoprolol (held due to acute heart failure)
* Aspirin 325 mg daily
* Plavix 75 mg daily
* Atorvastatin 40 mg daily
* Bactrim prophylaxis
* Gabapentin (held)
* Reglan for gastroparesis
* Citalopram and bupropion for depression

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 2.7 mg/dL (rising)
* Hematocrit: 23% (stable)
* Blood glucose: 98 mg/dL (controlled)
* White blood cell count: 12.1 x 10^9/L (normal)
* Platelet count: 483 x 10^9/L (normal)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Alert and oriented
* No acute distress
* Nasal cannula in place
* Bibasilar crackles in the lungs
* Soft and non-tender abdomen
* No edema in the legs

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
* Acute renal failure and potential for acute tubular necrosis
* Prerenal azotemia
* Acute heart failure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Infection (septic arthritis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection)
* Bleeding or hematoma related to the Swan-Ganz catheter or other invasive procedures
* Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension or hypertension
* Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Neurological complications, including seizures or stroke

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her condition, including frequent laboratory tests, imaging studies, and adjustments to her medications and treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening dyspnea and has been prescribed hydralazine for afterload reduction, lasix for diuresis, and tacrolimus for immunosuppression. Her creatinine level has been rising, and she has been diagnosed with acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute mitral regurgitation: The patient's severe mitral regurgitation may lead to worsening heart failure, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate worsening kidney function, which may require further interventions such as hemodialysis.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may lead to right heart failure, which may require further interventions such as cardiac catheterization and potential surgery.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's known coronary artery disease may lead to further cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Septic arthritis: The patient's recent septic arthritis may lead to further infection and sepsis, which may require further antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to further complications, such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
8. Depression: The patient's depression may lead to further complications, such as decreased appetite, weight loss, and decreased ability to cope with her illness.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. The patient underwent a transesophageal echo (TEE) and a Swan-Ganz catheter was removed. The TEE revealed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient's prograf level was elevated at 13.8, and the dose was decreased to 3mg. The patient was also given hydrocortisone 25mg TID and changed to prednisone 10mg on Sunday.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/67mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is stable, with an SpO2 of 98% and an ABG of 22mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T and CK, indicating myocardial damage. The patient's liver enzymes are also elevated, with an ALT of 122 IU/L and an AST of 54 IU/L.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, type 1, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremic syndrome.
3. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and use of immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of type I diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF). The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) which revealed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient's prograf level was elevated at 13.8, and the dose was decreased to 3mg. The patient received hydrocortisone 25 TID on Friday and Saturday, and the dose was changed to prednisone 10 on Sunday.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 143/67 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, and the patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of heart failure: The patient's TEE revealed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension, which may worsen over time if not managed properly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for further decline in renal function.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter.
4. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the use of anticoagulant medications and the presence of a central line.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and further elevation may occur if not managed properly.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, and further elevation may occur if not managed properly.
7. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's pulmonary hypertension and bilateral basilar crackles on lung examination may increase the risk of developing ARDS."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Diastolic Heart Failure/Mitral Regurgitation/Dsypnea:   The
   patient presented with worsening dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE
   showing new severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
   all c/w acute mitral regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements
   initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with
   this finding.  Pt also noted to have abnormally high mixed venous O2
   sats, which could represent cyanide tox vs. shunt.
   - Continue hydralazine for afterload reducation
   - Lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] with metolazone, per renal recs, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] consult for mitral valve replacement
   - TEE with bubble study to evaluate mitral valve and to evaluate for
   ASD
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   - can likely pull Swan this afternoon
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   - continue hyhdrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue tacrolimus 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23 yesterday; now stable at 25.
   No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   yesterday, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a living-related kidney transplant, is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute diastolic heart failure, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. She has been experiencing worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and new severe mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram. Swan-Ganz catheter measurements show pulmonary hypertension and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with acute mitral regurgitation.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL, and her tacrolimus level is elevated at 13.8. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, and her urine output is decreased. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia.

The patient has a history of septic arthritis of her left ankle, which is currently being treated with vancomycin. She is also experiencing anemia, with a hematocrit level of 25.3%. Her blood sugars are currently well-controlled, but she has a history of diabetes.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she is receiving hydralazine for afterload reduction. She is also receiving furosemide for diuresis and hydrocortisone for adrenal suppression.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension can lead to further deterioration of her cardiac function, which can result in decreased cardiac output, increased risk of arrhythmias, and decreased blood pressure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury, which can lead to further decline in renal function and increased risk of complications such as sepsis and cardiac arrest.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low calcium level can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased cardiac output.
6. Sepsis: The patient's history of septic arthritis and elevated white blood cell count suggest an increased risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
7. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular failure, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of complications such as pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrest.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing serious complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure. Currently, she is in the ICU due to worsening respiratory distress, acute mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. Her creatinine levels are rising, and she has hyaline and muddy brown casts in her urine, suggesting dehydration and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is being treated with IV hydralazine, nitroglycerin, and diuretics for heart failure and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, and she has hyaline and muddy brown casts in her urine, which may indicate ATN. AKI can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension may worsen her heart failure, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of arrhythmias, and further respiratory distress.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Septic Shock: The patient's septic arthritis and recent hospitalization may increase her risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to cardiovascular instability, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and diuretics may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and further complications.
6. Infection: The patient's septic arthritis and recent hospitalization may increase her risk of developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen her cardiovascular instability and increase her risk of bleeding.
8. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's diuretic therapy may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, which can exacerbate her cardiac and renal dysfunction.
9. Renal Failure: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, requiring further treatment and potential dialysis.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and developed acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.7°C, HR 97 bpm, BP 168/69 mmHg, RR 7 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen
* Cardiovascular: Sinus rhythm, bibasilar crackles, and a 4-5/6 holosystolic murmur heard throughout, most notably at the apex
* Renal: Creatinine 4.1 mg/dL, urine output 511 mL in 24 hours, hyaline and muddy brown casts in the urine, and a possible diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or pre-renal azotemia
* Hematological: Hematocrit 23%, white blood cell count 12.1 x 10^9/L, platelet count 439 x 10^9/L
* Laboratory results: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased albumin and calcium levels

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and she has hyaline and muddy brown casts in the urine, which can indicate ATN or pre-renal azotemia.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure, and her creatinine level is increasing, which can worsen her heart failure.
3. Septicemia: The patient has a history of septic arthritis, and she is still receiving vancomycin, which can increase the risk of septicemia.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has bibasilar crackles and is receiving nasal cannula oxygen, which can indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and she is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of septic arthritis and is still receiving antibiotics, which can increase the risk of infection.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a high anion gap and a low bicarbonate level, which can indicate metabolic acidosis.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a low potassium level and a high sodium level, which can indicate electrolyte imbalance.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular instability.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored, and her treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   6 week course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K
   ankle, daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15),
   weekly CBCs while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt
   abx
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -renal recs: check CXR, if volume overloaded, start metolazone 10 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] + Lasix 120 mg IV x 1 put out 200-300cc then started Lasix gtt,
   required K+ repletions during day.
   She was HTN, with SBP in 160s-170s, so hydralazine IV restarted then
   subsequently changed from Q6 to Q4 schedule, and nifedipine CR 30
   given, with nitro drip eventually added y/d pm which reduced her BPs to
   150s to 160s and now in 140s this am.
   -BP still elevated despite increase in hydralazine frequency and first
   dose of nifedipine; gave second dose of nifedipine CR 30 mg once
   -nitro drip increased to 4.0 mg/kg/min, with decrease in BP to 120s/50s
   -ordered RUE U/S due to RUE edema; wet read negative
   -held p.m. dose of tacrolimus per renal recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease with CABG and PCI, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with a living-related kidney transplant, and recent hospitalization for septic arthritis.

The patient's current condition is marked by acute mitral regurgitation, acute diastolic heart failure, and worsening systemic hypertension. She has also developed acute renal failure, which may be related to prerenal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis, or acute rejection.

The patient is receiving various medications, including hydralazine, nitroprusside, Lasix, and metolazone, to manage her blood pressure, heart failure, and renal function. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, indicating impaired renal function. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's medical history and current condition make her susceptible to various medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Acute mitral regurgitation may lead to further heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
	* Worsening systemic hypertension may exacerbate heart failure and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
	* Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Pulmonary hypertension may lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of pneumonia.
4. Infectious complications:
	* The patient's history of septic arthritis and ongoing antibiotic therapy make her susceptible to further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Neurological complications:
	* The patient's history of diabetes and kidney disease make her susceptible to neurological complications, including seizures and stroke.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including cardiac, renal, respiratory, infectious, and neurological complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management of her condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   6 week course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K
   ankle, daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15),
   weekly CBCs while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt
   abx
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   6 week course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K
   ankle, daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15),
   weekly CBCs while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt
   abx
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's condition worsened with increased systemic hypertension, increased shortness of breath, and a louder murmur, indicating a possible exacerbation of acute mitral regurgitation. This could lead to further heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels continue to rise, and the possibility of acute rejection or prerenal azotemia cannot be ruled out. This could lead to further decline in renal function and potential need for dialysis.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary artery hypertension could worsen, leading to right ventricular failure and decreased cardiac output.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure could worsen, leading to further increases in systemic hypertension and decreased cardiac output.
5. Septic Arthritis: The patient's recent septic arthritis could lead to further complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, or chronic joint damage.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potential organ dysfunction.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes could worsen, leading to hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or other complications.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, organ hypoperfusion, and potential organ failure.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to further decreases in oxygenation and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
10. Sepsis: The patient's septic arthritis could lead to sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of organ failure and mortality.

The patient's medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease, increases the risk of these complications. The patient's current condition, including acute mitral regurgitation, acute renal failure, and pulmonary hypertension, also increases the risk of further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-inch tall, 58.8 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic pain, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and acute diastolic heart failure on chronic heart failure (CHF).

The patient has been experiencing hypertension, with blood pressures ranging from 160s-170s mmHg, despite treatment with hydralazine and nifedipine. To manage this, the nitro drip was increased to 4.0 mg/kg/min, which resulted in a decrease in blood pressure to 120s/50s mmHg.

The patient has also been experiencing renal recs, with a requirement for potassium repletions during the day. A chest X-ray was ordered to check for volume overload, and metolazone 10 mg was started if necessary.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 108 bpm (99-113 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 137/57 mmHg (84-172/111 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 7 inspirations per minute (5-24 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's lab results show the following:

* White blood cell count: 12.1 (9.8-6.5)
* Hematocrit: 24 (25.3-24.9)
* Platelet count: 483 (453-439)
* Creatinine: 2.8 (3.4-3.7)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 140 mg/dL
* Serum potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Serum sodium: 135 mEq/L
* Serum chloride: 98 mEq/L
* Serum bicarbonate: 24.9 mmHg
* Blood glucose: 110-233 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 179 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Volume overload: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite treatment, and the chest X-ray may show evidence of volume overload.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient is already experiencing end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite treatment, and further management may be necessary to control blood pressure.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's serum potassium levels are elevated, and further potassium repletions may be necessary to manage this.
5. Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, and further management may be necessary to manage acidosis.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's serum sodium, chloride, and phosphorus levels are elevated, and further management may be necessary to manage electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and further evaluation may be necessary to identify the source of infection.
8. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is elevated, and further evaluation may be necessary to identify the cause of bleeding.

Further management and evaluation are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. Pt currently
   on IV hydral, nitro gtt, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload
   reduction.  Noted to be more hypertensive this AM than has been.
   - continue hydral, nifedipine; increase labetalol to 400 TID
   - attempt to wean nitro gtt if possible
   - holding lasix gtt as pt is diuresing well this morning; will recheck
   I/O this PM
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr improving today.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:  Per ortho recs, 6 week
   course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K ankle,
   daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15), weekly CBCs
   while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt abx
   - continue vanco; redosing this morning as level is 12
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recent baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit stable. No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - continue to trend Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure. She has been diagnosed with acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently receiving treatment with IV hydralazine, nitroglycerin, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction. Her creatinine level has improved, and she is diuresing well. She has also been prescribed vancomycin for septic arthritis and is receiving pain control with hydromorphone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent mitral regurgitation: The patient's blood pressure is not well controlled, which may lead to recurrent mitral regurgitation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved, but she is still at risk for acute renal failure due to her underlying renal disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen if her blood pressure is not well controlled.
4. Septic arthritis: The patient's septic arthritis may not be fully treated, which could lead to further complications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastroparesis may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if her blood pressure is not well controlled.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and acute mitral regurgitation may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's underlying cardiac disease and the use of medications may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of medications may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her blood pressure is not well controlled, which could lead to further complications.

Plan:

1. Continue treatment with IV hydralazine, nitroglycerin, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust treatment as necessary to ensure tight control.
3. Continue to diuresis the patient and monitor her creatinine level to ensure that it does not rise.
4. Continue to treat the patient's septic arthritis with vancomycin and monitor her response to treatment.
5. Monitor the patient's pain control and adjust treatment as necessary to ensure that her pain is well managed.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent neurological complications.
10. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted to the ICU for septic arthritis and acute renal failure. She has recently been diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's current condition is complicated by worsening systemic hypertension, increased shortness of breath, and a louder mitral regurgitation murmur. Her creatinine level is rising, and she has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. The patient is also experiencing acute diastolic heart failure and is being treated with IV hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's worsening systemic hypertension and increased shortness of breath suggest a possibility of worsening acute diastolic heart failure, which could lead to further cardiac compromise and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine level and diagnosis of acute renal failure suggest a high risk of further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension increases her risk of right ventricular failure and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Severe Mitral Regurgitation: The patient's diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation increases her risk of cardiac compromise and potential cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's recent diagnosis of septic arthritis and acute renal failure suggest a high risk of infection, which could lead to further complications and potential sepsis.
6. Hypoperfusion: The patient's diagnosis of acute renal failure and worsening cardiac function suggest a high risk of hypoperfusion, which could lead to further organ damage and potential multi-organ failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of diabetes and recent use of steroids increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications and potential hemorrhagic shock.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction to manage the patient's acute diastolic heart failure.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine level closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
3. Consider nicardipine infusion to manage the patient's pulmonary hypertension.
4. Continue steroid taper per renal recs to manage the patient's acute renal failure.
5. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider antibiotics if necessary to manage potential infections.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider vasopressors if necessary to manage potential hypoperfusion.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and consider prophylactic measures if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation.  Swan-Ganz catheter measurements initially showing PA htn
   and elevated wedge pressure, consistent with this finding. This
   morning, patient has worsened systemic hypertension, increased SOB, and
   louder MR murmur.
   - restart IV hydralazine + nitro gtt for afterload reduction
   - consider nicardipine gtt
   - Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone, followed by lasix gtt, for better
   diuresis.
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr still rising.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:
   6 week course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K
   ankle, daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15),
   weekly CBCs while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt
   abx
   - per ID res, stopping ceftaz; will continue vanco
   - still holding vanc at this time, as vanc level still elevated
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recemt baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit decreased to 23; now stable. No obvious
   bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a living-related kidney transplant 10 years ago. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis of the left ankle and developed acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for management of her heart failure, acute renal failure, and septic arthritis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 145/60 mmHg, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her respiratory status is stable, with an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.47/42/86.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 164 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving IV hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction, and Lasix 120 mg IV with metolazone for diuresis. She is also receiving IV antibiotics for septic arthritis and prophylactic antibiotics for DVT and stress ulcer prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's heart failure is worsening, and she is at risk for further decompensation. She may require additional therapy, such as IABP, to support her cardiac function.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is rising, and she is at risk for further kidney damage. She may require additional therapy, such as dialysis, to support her renal function.
3. Septic arthritis: The patient has septic arthritis of the left ankle, and she is at risk for further infection and complications.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, and she is at risk for further worsening of her pulmonary function.
5. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, and she is at risk for further complications, such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she receive close monitoring and management in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 67-inch tall, 55.7 kg individual with a history of type I diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and chronic heart failure. They are currently in the ICU for acute decompensation of their heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/60 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient has a history of pain and is receiving Dilaudid for leg pain. They are also receiving standing nifedipine and labetolol for blood pressure control.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 453. The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 3.4 to 2.4 mg/dL, indicating improvement in renal function.

The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including heparin, hydralazine, and metolazone. They are also receiving insulin for glycemic control and sliding scale insulin for diabetes management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of heart failure: The patient's heart failure is acute on chronic, and they may require further treatment to manage their symptoms and prevent further decompensation.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has decreased, but they are still at risk for renal failure due to their underlying end-stage renal disease.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the elevated white blood cell count.
4. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which may increase their risk of bleeding.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin for glycemic control, which may increase their risk of hypoglycemia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex individual with multiple medical conditions and medications. They require close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic pain, and end-stage renal disease. They have been receiving codeine and amoxicillin, but have experienced nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/60 mmHg. They are receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and have an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -3,119 mL, with an input of 1,546 mL and an output of 4,665 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 453 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 136 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, and chloride level of 97 mEq/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen level is 53 mg/dL, and their creatinine level is 3.4 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, diabetes mellitus type I, pain control, renal failure, and heart failure. They are receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within normal limits, but they are receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula. This may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if their oxygen saturation drops or they experience increased respiratory distress.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is 145/60 mmHg, which is within normal limits, but they have a history of chronic pain and heart failure. This may indicate a risk of cardiovascular instability, particularly if their blood pressure drops or they experience increased cardiac distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.4 mg/dL, which is within normal limits, but they have a history of end-stage renal disease. This may indicate a risk of renal failure, particularly if their creatinine level increases or they experience decreased urine output.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is 9.8 K/uL, which is within normal limits, but they have a history of chronic pain and diabetes mellitus type I. This may indicate a risk of infection, particularly if their white blood cell count drops or they experience increased symptoms of infection.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's albumin level is 3.0 g/dL, which is within normal limits, but they have a history of chronic pain and diabetes mellitus type I. This may indicate a risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly if their albumin level drops or they experience increased symptoms of malnutrition."

   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease who has undergone a kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and acute renal failure, and was diagnosed with acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She is currently in the ICU for management of her condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/60 mmHg. She is receiving IV fluids and medications to manage her condition, including hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol.

The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, indicating acute renal failure. Her troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, indicating possible infection.

The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, with scattered crackles in the lungs and a holosystolic murmur heard throughout the cardiac examination. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or rebound tenderness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine and BUN levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to pre-renal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis, or post-renal obstruction.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has been diagnosed with acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. She may be at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's CBC shows a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, indicating possible infection. She has a history of septic arthritis and may be at risk for further infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, but she may be at risk for anemia due to her history of bleeding and her current medical condition.
5. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes and may be at risk for hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to her current medical condition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for various medical complications. She will continue to receive IV fluids and medications to manage her condition, and will be closely monitored for signs of infection, cardiac complications, and anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   1. Postoperative change at the distal fibula.
   2. Persistent destruction of medial malleolus fracture with adjacent
   cortical irregularity compatible with prior debridement, but residual
   infection is not excluded.
   3. Subtle increase in density at the posterior aspect of the calcaneus

Summary:

The patient, a 45-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease, is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute diastolic heart failure, acute mitral regurgitation, and septic arthritis. She has been treated with various medications, including tacrolimus, lasix, and vancomycin, and has undergone several procedures, including cardiac catheterization and kidney transplant.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 86 beats per minute, blood pressure 143/62 mmHg, respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Laboratory results: Creatinine 3.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 383 mg/dL, sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, and glucose 180 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: The patient is drowsy and arousable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 143/62 mmHg. She has a soft, non-tender abdomen and no masses or edema.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a history of end-stage renal disease. She may be at risk for acute kidney injury due to her current condition.
2. Heart failure: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure and acute mitral regurgitation, which may worsen her condition and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Septic arthritis: The patient has septic arthritis in her left ankle, which may lead to further complications and increase her risk of sepsis.
4. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes and is at risk for further complications, including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may be at risk for further complications, including myocardial infarction.
6. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which may worsen her condition and increase her risk of respiratory complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastroparesis and may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, including nausea and vomiting.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust her medications as needed to manage her condition and prevent complications.
3. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her heart failure and mitral regurgitation.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's septic arthritis and consider referring her to an infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and management.
5. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes and consider referring her to an endocrinologist for further evaluation and management.
6. Consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management of her gastroparesis.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary hypertension and consider referring her to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management."

   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation. ? If this is ischemic in nature. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding. Had initially been on nitro drip which
   has been dc
d as has lasix gtt with patient now on IV boluses.  Pt
   currently on IV hydral, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload
   reduction. HR is also noted to be in the 90s
   -would consider uptitrating labetolol further given both alpha/beta
   effects for HR/BP control.
   -continue nifedipine at 90 CR for now.
   - continue IV hydral for now.
   - continue IV boluses lasix
   - holding lasix gtt as pt is diuresing well this morning; will recheck
   I/O this PM
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr improving today.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:  Per ortho recs, 6 week
   course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K ankle,
   daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15), weekly CBCs
   while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt abx
   - continue vanco; redosing this morning as level is 12
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recent baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit stable. No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - continue to trend Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   measurements initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding. Had initially been on nitro drip which
   has been dc
d as has lasix gtt with patient now on IV boluses.  Pt
   currently on IV hydral, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload
   reduction. HR is also noted to be in the 90s
   -would consider uptitrating labetolol further given both alpha/beta
   effects for HR/BP control.
   -continue nifedipine at 90 CR for now.
   - continue IV hydral for now.
   - continue IV boluses lasix
   - holding lasix gtt as pt is diuresing well this morning; will recheck
   I/O this PM
   - Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.
   U lytes more c/w pre-renal azotemia.  U/s of transplanted kidney WNL.
   Cr improving today.
   - continue steroid taper per renal recs
   - f/u tacrolimus level
   - continue bactrim prophylaxis.
   - holding gabapentin
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - appreciate any additional renal recs
   - diuresis as above
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on EKG.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   # Recent septic arthritis of her left ankle:  Per ortho recs, 6 week
   course of vanc from day of explant, d/w ortho wound care for K ankle,
   daily vanc levels while renal fxn changing (redose if <15), weekly CBCs
   while on vanc, call ID when closed to d/c to arrange outpt abx
   - continue vanco; redosing this morning as level is 12
   - Pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   # Anemia:  The patient's Hct on admission was 27.9 (her recent baseline
   is 25 to 27).  Hematocrit stable. No obvious bleeding.
   - Continue outpatient ferrous sulfate.
   - Active type and screen
   - continue to trend Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars better controlled at this time. Were elevated
   initially, likely related to stress dose steroids. Now off of insulin
   gtt.
   - continue home regimen of insulin
   - Continue reglan for gastroparesis.
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient, a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of her condition. The note highlights several key issues:

1. Cardiovascular:
	* The patient has acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.
	* She is receiving IV hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction.
	* The possibility of uptitrating labetalol further is being considered for HR/BP control.
2. Renal:
	* The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to a living-related kidney transplant.
	* Her creatinine level rose after an undetectable tacrolimus level, making acute rejection a possibility.
	* She is receiving steroid taper per renal recommendations and bactrim prophylaxis.
	* The possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from poor forward flow/hypoperfusion is being considered.
3. Infectious:
	* The patient has a recent history of septic arthritis in her left ankle, which is being treated with vancomycin (Vanc).
	* She is receiving daily Vanc levels while renal function is changing, with redosing if the level is <15.
4. Anemia:
	* The patient's Hct is stable, and no obvious bleeding is present.
	* She is receiving outpatient ferrous sulfate and active type and screen.
5. Diabetes:
	* The patient's blood sugars are better controlled, and she is no longer receiving insulin gtt.
	* She is continuing her home regimen of insulin and reglan for gastroparesis.
6. Other:
	* The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG and PCI, and her EKG is showing sinus rhythm.
	* She is receiving ASA, plavix, and atorvastatin for coronary artery disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may worsen if not adequately managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and the possibility of AKI or ATN is being considered.
3. Infection: The patient's septic arthritis is being treated, but the possibility of infection persists, especially with the presence of central lines and indwelling catheters.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and ongoing anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status is complex, and cardiovascular instability may occur if not properly managed.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and possible fluid overload may increase the risk of respiratory compromise.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and ensure optimal management of her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, with a current glucose level of 383 mg/dL. They have been treated with vancomycin, and the level has been <15. The patient has a history of constipation, alteration in nutrition, diabetes mellitus type I, pain control, renal failure, and heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 140s, heart rate of 86 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals a drowsy and arousable individual, with a soft and non-tender abdomen. The patient's extremities are wwp, with no edema or masses.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.8, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 438 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 3.7, and their potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's current glucose level of 383 mg/dL is concerning, and the patient may be at risk for further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
2. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation may worsen with the use of medications such as metolazone, and the patient may be at risk for bowel obstruction or perforation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 3.7 is concerning, and the patient may be at risk for further decline in renal function or acute kidney injury.
4. Heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure and the use of medications such as labetalol and nifedipine may increase the patient's risk for further cardiac complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's history of vancomycin treatment and the possibility of residual infection at the ankle may increase the patient's risk for sepsis.
6. Wound infection: The patient's history of surgery and the possibility of residual infection at the ankle may increase the patient's risk for wound infection.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of immobility and the use of prophylactic heparin may increase the patient's risk for pulmonary embolism.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex ICU admission with multiple medical complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their hyperglycemia, constipation, renal failure, heart failure, and potential sepsis or wound infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 45-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to a living-related kidney transplant, is currently in the ICU with acute diastolic heart failure, acute mitral regurgitation, and septic arthritis of the left ankle. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis and has been experiencing worsening dyspnea, crackles on examination, and severe mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram.

The patient's lab results show elevated blood sugars, anemia, and renal failure. Her creatinine level has improved from 4.1 to 3.7, and her urine output has increased to 1.5 liters. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's medications include tacrolimus, lasix, nifedipine, labetalol, hydralazine, and vancomycin. She is also receiving insulin therapy and has a history of gastroparesis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved, but her urine output is still low, and her electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may indicate ongoing renal failure.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood sugars have been elevated, and she has a history of type 1 diabetes, which may increase her risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis.
3. Heart failure: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure and severe mitral regurgitation, which may worsen her cardiac function and increase her risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Infection: The patient has septic arthritis of the left ankle and may be at risk for developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to her chronic disease, but it may also be exacerbated by her recent hospitalization and treatment with vancomycin.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medications accordingly.
2. Consider adding insulin therapy to help control her blood sugars.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her medications accordingly.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to treat the patient's septic arthritis and prevent further infections.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider adding iron supplements or erythropoietin therapy if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications accordingly to prevent electrolyte imbalance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains complex and dynamic. The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, and despite efforts to control it, the glucose levels remain elevated. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 383 mg/dL.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also a concern, with a blood pressure in the 140s and a heart rate of 86 beats per minute. The patient is receiving labetalol and nifedipine to manage blood pressure.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% and an ABG report pending. The patient's neurological status is not assessed, and the physical examination is incomplete due to the patient's uncooperative nature.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's liver enzymes are also elevated, with an ALT level of 122 IU/L and an AST level of 54 IU/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus, type I, and end-stage renal disease. The patient's current medications include tacrolimus, lasix, metolazone, vancomycin, heparin, and hydralazine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of hyperglycemia, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia.
2. Progression of renal failure, potentially requiring dialysis.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, due to the patient's hypertension and tachycardia.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, due to the patient's underlying respiratory status.
5. Infection, particularly in the setting of compromised immune function and prolonged hospitalization.
6. Liver dysfunction or failure, potentially due to the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications.
7. Bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -holding gabapentin
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to heart failure
   - Will need cath when renal function improved
   .
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of left ankle: Patient will need 6 week
   course of vanc from day of explant. Will need to monitor weekly
   CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, LFTs, vanc trough while on vanc.

   Communication:  Comments: Pt, mother
   [**Name (NI) 66**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease. She has undergone a living-related kidney transplant and has recently been hospitalized for septic arthritis of the left ankle.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.9°C, HR 85 bpm, BP 131/59 mmHg, RR 12 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen therapy
* Cardiovascular status: Acute mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and acute diastolic heart failure
* Renal function: Creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, improving from a peak of 4.1 mg/dL
* Hemodynamics: Swan-Ganz catheter measurements showing pulmonary artery hypertension and elevated wedge pressure
* Medications: Hydralazine, labetalol, nifedipine, metoprolol, ASA, plavix, atorvastatin, prograf, prednisone, and vanc

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of acute mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, leading to further cardiac dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute renal failure, which may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying kidney disease and potential nephrotoxic effects of certain medications.
3. Infection, particularly in the setting of the patient's recent septic arthritis and immunosuppressed state.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, given the patient's history of gastroparesis and potential gastrointestinal complications.
5. Depression, which may require close monitoring and potential adjustments to the patient's medication regimen.
6. Anemia, which may require ongoing management with iron supplements and potential blood transfusions.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete blood count (CBC): 6.9 x 10^9/L, 5.7 x 10^9/L, 5.0 x 10^9/L, 5.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.9%
* Platelet count (Plt): 460 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 36 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 136 mmol/L, K 3.7 mmol/L, Cl 93 mmol/L, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, Mg 2.4 mg/dL, PO4 3.3 mg/dL
* Liver function tests (LFTs): ALT 122 IU/L, AST 54 IU/L, Alk Phos 443 IU/L, T Bili 0.3 mg/dL
* Coagulation studies: PT 12.2 seconds, PTT 25.1 seconds, INR 1.0
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 179 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.4 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 11751**] is a 45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI,
   ESRD s/p living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent
   hospitalization for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure,
   acute diastolic heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and
   pulmonary hypertension.
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:   The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation. ? If this is ischemic in nature. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding. Had initially been on nitro drip which
   has been dc
d as has lasix gtt with patient now on IV boluses.  Pt
   currently on IV hydral, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload
   reduction. HR is also noted to be in the 90s
   -would consider uptitrating labetolol further given both alpha/beta
   effects for HR/BP control.
   -continue nifedipine at 90 CR for now.
   - continue IV hydral for now.
   - continue IV boluses lasix (started on 80 IV BID 3pm with UOP 1.5L)
   -- Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   - f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - IABP could be considered as a temporary hemodynamic support if
   decompensates
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  The patient's creatinine
   rose after she was noted to have an undetectable tacrolimus level
   making acute rejection a possibility.  Also in the setting of acute
   heart failure is prerenal vs ATN from poor foward flow/hypoperfusion.

   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to chf exacerbation.
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Monitor telemetry.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**Name (NI) 66**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) following a living-related kidney transplant. She has been admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 131/59 mmHg. She is receiving various medications, including hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction, as well as insulin for glucose control.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury. Her urine output is 1.5 liters over the past 24 hours, and her electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute mitral regurgitation: The patient's echocardiogram shows severe mitral regurgitation, which is likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction. She is receiving IV hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen, and she is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor forward flow and hypoperfusion. Her urine output is increasing, and her electrolyte levels are within normal range.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is receiving ASA, plavix, and atorvastatin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.
4. Septic arthritis: The patient has a history of septic arthritis of her left ankle, which was treated with vancomycin. She is receiving ongoing wound care and antibiotic therapy.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, and her hematocrit is 23.8% today. She is receiving outpatient ferrous sulfate and guaiac testing for occult blood.
6. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 1, and her blood sugars have been elevated over the past 24 hours. She is receiving insulin therapy and has intermittent severe nausea with decreased appetite.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is complex, and she is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, particularly given her recent heart failure exacerbation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary hypertension and acute diastolic heart failure increase her risk for respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic arthritis and ongoing antibiotic therapy increase her risk for sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury and ongoing nephrotoxicity from antibiotics increase her risk for chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.

The patient's current medications and therapies include:

1. Insulin therapy for glucose control
2. Hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction
3. Vancomycin for septic arthritis
4. ASA, plavix, and atorvastatin for cardiovascular prophylaxis
5. Ferrous sulfate for anemia
6. Guaiac testing for occult blood
7. Citalopram and bupropion for depression
8. Reglan for gastroparesis

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of her cardiac status and electrolyte levels
2. Ongoing antibiotic therapy for septic arthritis
3. Insulin therapy for glucose control
4. Continued afterload reduction therapy with hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol
5. Close monitoring of her anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms
6. Consideration of uptitration of labetalol for afterload reduction
7. Discussion with the patient and her family regarding her treatment plan and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after a living-related kidney transplant. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute mitral regurgitation, acute diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 131/59 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula and has a Swan-Ganz catheter in place to monitor her hemodynamics.

The patient's laboratory results show improving renal function, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. Her blood sugar levels are labile, and she is receiving insulin sliding scale therapy to manage her hyperglycemia.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine for afterload reduction; metoprolol for heart failure; and prograf for immunosuppression. She is also receiving antibiotics for septic arthritis of the left ankle.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and she may require further dose adjustments of her immunosuppressive medications.
2. Heart failure: The patient's mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension may worsen, leading to further decompensation of her heart failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic arthritis of the left ankle may lead to sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's labile blood sugar levels may lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastroparesis and use of anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and medications. She will require close monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure, sepsis, or acute kidney injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with a living-related kidney transplant. She is currently in the ICU due to acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 92 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Acute mitral regurgitation, which is likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction or ischemia
* Acute renal failure, which is improving but may still require further treatment
* Anemia, which is stable but may require further management
* Depression, which is being treated with citalopram and bupropion
* Gastroparesis, which is being treated with Reglan
* Hypoglycemia, which is being managed with insulin sliding scale
* Septic arthritis of the left ankle, which is being treated with vancomycin and pain control

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Tacrolimus for immunosuppression
* Prednisone for immunosuppression
* Hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction
* Lasix for diuresis
* Bactrim for prophylaxis
* Citalopram and bupropion for depression
* Reglan for gastroparesis
* Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Vancomycin for septic arthritis
* Pain control medications, including hydromorphone

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing tacrolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression
* Continuing hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction
* Stopping metolazone and converting Lasix to PO
* Treating ankle infection with vancomycin and pain control
* Following up with Dr. [Last Name] in 3-5 weeks
* Monitoring renal function and adjusting medications as needed
* Continuing ASA, Plavix, and atorvastatin for coronary artery disease
* Monitoring telemetry and adjusting medications as needed
* Following up with ortho in 3-5 weeks for septic arthritis
* Monitoring CBC, BUN, Cr, LFTs, and vanc trough while on vanc for septic arthritis
* Continuing ferrous sulfate for anemia
* Continuing glargine for diabetes
* Decreasing bedtime sliding scale for diabetes
* Reglan for gastroparesis
* Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued decline in renal function
* Worsening of mitral regurgitation
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Development of gastroparesis-related complications
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin sliding scale
* Septic arthritis-related complications
* Anemia-related complications
* Depression-related complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent a living-related kidney transplant. She was recently hospitalized for septic arthritis of the left ankle and is currently in the ICU due to acute mitral regurgitation, acute diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. She has been experiencing worsening dyspnea, crackles on exam, and new severe mitral regurgitation on TTE.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for her conditions, including hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload reduction, metolazone for diuresis, and Bactrim prophylaxis. She is also receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and ferrous sulfate for anemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving, but she still requires close monitoring of her renal function.
2. Heart failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure is being managed with afterload reduction medications, but she may require further treatment if her symptoms worsen.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is being managed with oxygen therapy, but she may require further treatment if her symptoms worsen.
4. Septic arthritis: The patient's septic arthritis of the left ankle is being managed with antibiotics and pain control, but she may require further treatment if her symptoms worsen.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being managed with ferrous sulfate, but she may require further treatment if her symptoms worsen.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin sliding scale, but she may require further treatment if her symptoms worsen.
7. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with citalopram and bupropion, but she may require further treatment if her symptoms worsen.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her complex medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo woman with pmh of DM1, CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ESRD s/p
   living-related kidney transplant in [**10-31**], and recent hospitalization
   for septic arthritis here with acute renal failure, acute diastolic
   heart failure with newly diagnosed severe MR and pulmonary
   hypertension.
   .
   # Acute Mitral Regurgitation:  The patient presented with worsening
   dyspnea, had crackles on exam, and TTE showing new severe mitral
   regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension
 all c/w acute mitral
   regurgiation. ? If this is ischemic in nature. Swan-Ganz catheter
   measurements initially showing PA htn and elevated wedge pressure,
   consistent with this finding. Had initially been on nitro drip which
   has been dc
d as has lasix gtt with patient now on IV boluses.  Pt
   currently on PO hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol for afterload
   reduction.
   -continue hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine
   -can uptitrate labetalol if additional BP control required
   -patient diuresing this a.m. on metolazone alone; will hold off on
   Lasix boluses for now and follow urine output
   -Holding metoprolol for now due to acute CHF
   -f/u CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs: already got carotid ultrasound, will call dental for
   pre-operative evaluation, cardiac cath will be deferred until renal
   function has improved
   -Treat ankle infection as below
   .
   # Acute renal failure/ s/p renal transplant:  Rejection vs. ATN, now
   improving.  U/S of transplanted kidney WNL. Cr  continues to improve
   from 4.1 at peak to 1.9 today.
   -dose prograf by level per renal. Currently at 4mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -f/u prograf level
   -continue Bactrim prophylaxis
   -continue prednisone at 10 mg daily; per renal, will hold off on
   further taper until tacro levels stable
   -[**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   -holding gabapentin
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient has known coronary artery disease s/p CABG
   and PCI.  No current chest pain or EKG changes, although ischemia is
   possible etiology of papillary muscle dysfunction.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg po daily, plavix 75 mg daily, and atorvastatin 40
   mg po daily.
   - Holding metoprolol due to heart failure
   - Will need cath when renal function improved
   .
   # RHYTHM: She is in sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Monitor telemetry.
   .
   # Recent septic arthritis of left ankle: Patient will need 6 week
   course of vanc from day of explant. Will need to monitor weekly
   CBC/diff, BUN, Cr, LFTs, vanc trough while on vanc.
   -dose vanc by levels
   -pain control with hydromorphone 2 mg q3h prn.
   -f/u with ortho in [**3-5**] weeks
   -wet to dry dressing changes were ortho recs
   .
   # Anemia:  Hct stable.  Iron studies consistent with deficiency.
   -Continue ferrous sulfate.
   -Active type and screen
   -daily Hct
   # Diabetes: Blood sugars labile in setting of gastroparesis,
   inconsistent PO intake. Was hypoglycemic this a.m. secondary to
   aggressive treatment of hyperglycemic last night.
   -Continue glargine 24 units daily
   -Reglan for gastroparesis with Zofran PRN nausea
   -insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Depression:
   - Continue citalopram and bupropion.

   Communication:  Comments: Pt, mother
   [**Name (NI) 66**] status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with a living-related kidney transplant. She has been hospitalized for septic arthritis of the left ankle and has developed acute renal failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and severe mitral regurgitation.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improving renal function and decreased blood pressure. She is receiving various medications, including antihypertensives, diuretics, and antibiotics. Her laboratory results show improvement in her kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has improved, but she is still at risk for AKI due to her underlying kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
2. Heart failure: The patient has acute diastolic heart failure, which can worsen if her mitral regurgitation is not adequately treated.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen if her mitral regurgitation is not adequately treated.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of septic arthritis and is at risk for developing further infections, particularly in her transplanted kidney.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has gastroparesis, which can increase her risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has labile blood sugars and is at risk for hypoglycemia, particularly if her insulin sliding scale is not adjusted properly.
7. Depression: The patient is receiving treatment for depression, but she is still at risk for developing further depressive episodes.
8. Anemia: The patient has iron deficiency anemia, which can worsen if her iron supplements are not adequate.
9. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known coronary artery disease, which can worsen if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her medications and treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."
