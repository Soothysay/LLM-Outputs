   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold lasix
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] from [**2134-5-21**] and [**Doctor Last Name 4058**]
   [**2134-5-22**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   She has not had significant bradycardia here and etiology of transient
   bradycardia may be some degree of contribution from her infection.  I
   suspect that she will not need a pacemaker but will obtain EP input.
   Hold dopamine.   Consult renal service regarding management of anuric
   renal failure.  Her Aortic stenosis does not seem to be a major
   hemodynamic contributor.  Treat for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.

   [**2134-5-22**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   She has not had significant bradycardia here and etiology of transient
   bradycardia may be some degree of contribution from her infection.  I
   suspect that she will not need a pacemaker but will obtain EP input.
   Hold dopamine.   Consult renal service regarding management of anuric
   renal failure.  Her Aortic stenosis does not seem to be a major
   hemodynamic contributor.  Treat for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
   Date of service [**2134-5-22**]  Time spent with patient 40 minutes.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the key points as follows:

1. The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI, who was transferred to the ICU with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, and ARF.
2. The patient has developed severe AS, with a valve area of 0.9 cm2, and a peak gradient of ~80 and mean gradient of ~50.
3. The patient has developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), with a WBC count of >2900 and 92% polymorphonuclear cells in the ascitic fluid.
4. The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL and a urine sodium level of 20, which may be due to ATN or prerenal etiology.
5. The patient has developed anemia, with a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25, which may be due to GI bleed or other causes.
6. The patient has hypotension, which has now resolved, and may have been due to dehydration or overmedication.
7. The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG, with preserved EF 65-70%, but new finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Further deterioration of renal function, potentially leading to hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Progression of aortic stenosis, potentially leading to heart failure or death.
3. Recurrent episodes of SBP, potentially leading to further complications.
4. Development of GI bleed, potentially leading to anemia and other complications.
5. Further decline in liver function, potentially leading to worsening cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue ceftriaxone for 5 days for SBP.
2. Administer albumin to expand plasma volume and increase blood flow to the kidneys.
3. Monitor urine output and creatinine levels to assess renal function.
4. Consider Cipro 750 mg weekly for prophylaxis against recurrent SBP.
5. Hold beta-blocker and calcium-channel blocker due to bradycardia and hypotension.
6. Monitor for signs of GI bleed and anemia.
7. Consult nephrology and cardiology services for further management.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          Will consider abx if has positive infectious work-up
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was

   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and

   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at

   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for

   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more

   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued

   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          Will consider abx if has positive infectious work-up
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of CAD, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI who was transferred from OSH with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and ARF. The patient's increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing peritoneal ascites, which is likely caused by portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis.

The patient's SBP is confirmed by the paracentesis, which showed WBC of >2900 with 92% polymorphs and ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) 1.7. The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg.

The patient's aortic stenosis is confirmed by TTE, which showed aortic valve area of 0.9cm2, peak gradient ~80, and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.

The patient's bradycardia is likely due to carvedilol toxicity, and she was discontinued from the medication. Her acute renal failure is likely caused by ATN secondary to prerenal etiology, and she was started on IV albumin.

The patient's anemia is likely due to GI bleed, and she was put on a PPI and a type and screen was sent. Her hypotension has resolved, and she is no longer on dopamine.

The patient's CAD is s/p CABG, and her cardiac biomarkers were negative at the outside hospital. She was started on aspirin 325mg PO daily and simvastatin 20mg PO daily.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites increase her risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome, which is associated with a poor prognosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's SBP and leukocytosis increase her risk for developing sepsis.
3. ARF: The patient's ATN and prerenal etiology increase her risk for developing ARF.
4. GI bleed: The patient's anemia and GI bleed increase her risk for developing further GI bleeding.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis and CAD increase her risk for developing cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's ascites and pleural effusion increase her risk for developing respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and pleural effusion.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine and urine output daily.
3. Trend the patient's hematocrit and consider transfusions if necessary.
4. Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily and simvastatin 20mg PO daily.
5. Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia and hypotension.
6. Restart furosemide as renal function improves.
7. Consider nephrology consult for further management of ARF.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and fluids daily.
9. Consider abx if the patient has a positive infectious work-up.
10. Continue diabetic, heart healthy, low-salt diet, kidney-friendly (low protein), and liver healthy diet; fluid restriction 1.5L; replete lytes as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute on
   chronic renal failure due to ATN from hypotension during her episodes
   of supra-therapeutic drug action. We

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute on
   chronic renal failure due to ATN from hypotension during her episodes
   of supra-therapeutic drug action. We

   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past

   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.

   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.

Based on the provided medical note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis, type II diabetes, and coronary artery disease. She has been admitted to the ICU with severe aortic stenosis, acute on chronic renal failure, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's medical history includes a recent hospitalization for supraventricular tachycardia and a previous diagnosis of cirrhosis. She has also had a history of ascites and has undergone paracentesis.

The patient's current condition is complicated by her aortic stenosis, which is causing her symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Her renal function is impaired, and she is at risk for further decline. Her liver function is also compromised, and she is at risk for further liver damage.

The patient's treatment plan includes ongoing management of her diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac conditions. She will also require ongoing monitoring of her liver and renal function, as well as further evaluation and treatment of her SBP.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further decline in renal function, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
2. Further liver damage, leading to liver failure
3. Infection, including sepsis and septic shock
4. Cardiac complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias
5. Respiratory complications, including respiratory failure and pneumonia

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Cipro 750 mg qweek starting after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.

   - Ultrasound-guided paracentesis (diagnostic)
   - Liver recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**]
   - Low salt diet, fluid restriction

   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA
   - Urine culture, blood cultures
   - Diagnostic paracentesis

   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline 1.7. Creatinine now 3.3.
   Differential includes ATN secondary to respond hypotensive episode
   (although patient was with renal failure prior to episode yesterday),
   prerenal etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic
   stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**] also be secondary to medications - recently started on
   HCTZ.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Cipro 750 mg qweek starting after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily

   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post-triple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). She was transferred to the ICU with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's increasing abdominal girth is due to peritoneal ascites, which is likely caused by portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. The ascites is complicated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is treated with ceftriaxone and albumin.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. Her blood culture and urine culture are pending, and she is being treated for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she is being monitored closely for signs of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's cardiac condition is complicated by aortic stenosis, which is likely contributing to her dyspnea. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) shows a valve area of 0.9 cm², peak gradient of 80 mmHg, and mean gradient of 50 mmHg. The patient is being considered for valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, but the risk of surgery is high due to her cirrhosis and ascites.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of ascites and SBP: The patient's ascites and SBP may worsen if not properly treated, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure, septic shock, and death.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ARF may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis may worsen if not properly treated, leading to further complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death.
4. Sepsis: The patient's SBP and UTI may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ failure, shock, and death.
5. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as liver failure, encephalopathy, and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's dyspnea and ARF may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, which suggests peritonitis.
   Measurement of the ascetic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, where lowest
   protein concentration correlates with a highest risk of developing SBP
   because of low concentrations of opsonins.
   most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day
   1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3
   ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro for the rest of
   her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, which suggests peritonitis.
   Measurement of the ascetic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, where lowest
   protein concentration correlates with a highest risk of developing SBP
   because of low concentrations of opsonins.
   most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day
   1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3
   ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro for the rest of
   her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) with triple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). The patient was recently transferred to the ICU from the operating room (OSH) with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.

The patient's abdominal girth is increasing due to peritoneal ascites, which is confirmed by ultrasound-guided paracentesis. The ascitic fluid total protein concentration is 1.7 g/dL, which is consistent with a transudate. The patient has a high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin) of 2.3, which suggests portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis.

The patient's shortness of breath is likely related to the ascites, which is causing a restrictive process that makes it harder for her to inhale, as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is confirmed by the presence of WBCs in the ascitic fluid.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, and her creatinine level has increased to 3.3 mg/dL. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotensive episode, prerenal etiology, and medications.

The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures are pending, and she is being treated with ceftriaxone for suspected SBP. She will require albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3 and regular ciprofloxacin to prevent recurrence of SBP.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with severe AS and recent episodes of bradycardia and hypotension. She has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG. Her cardiac biomarkers were negative at the outside hospital, but her TTE showed preserved EF with new findings of severe AS.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with diffuse expiratory wheezes and no crackles or rhonchi. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.

The patient's pain control is being managed with Tylenol, and she has a knowledge deficit regarding her medical condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of ascites and potential development of SBP
2. Further deterioration of renal function
3. Development of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
5. Infection, such as sepsis or UTI
6. Hemodynamic instability, including hypotension or hypertension
7. Further development of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
8. Complications related to cirrhosis, such as bleeding or encephalopathy
9. Development of diabetes-related complications, such as nephropathy or retinopathy
10. Potential need for surgical intervention, such as valve replacement or liver transplant.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, most consistent with spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP). The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily
   x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin
   1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro
   for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Top of the differential diagnosis for portal
   hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis. Because
   our patient has SBP,
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

   )
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   consistent with transudate; total protein ascites 1.7 vs. serum 6.5
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.
   - Abdominal ultrasound with doppler
   - Ultrasound-guided paracentesis (diagnostic)
   - Liver recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**]
   - Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA
   - Urine culture, blood cultures
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline 1.7. Creatinine now 3.3.
   Differential includes ATN secondary to respond hypotensive episode
   (although patient was with renal failure prior to episode yesterday),
   prerenal etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic
   stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**] also be secondary to medications - recently started on
   HCTZ.
   - Urine lytes, UA
   - Close monitoring of urine output
   - Hold diuretics

s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, most consistent with spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP). The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily
   x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin
   1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro
   for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Top of the differential diagnosis for portal
   hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis. Because
   our patient has SBP,
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (

   bacterial peritonitis.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI, who was transferred from another hospital with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and ARF. She has been experiencing increasing abdominal girth and shortness of breath, which is attributed to ascites. An ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, showing approximately 5L of ascites, with removal of 1.4L of peritoneal fluid, which revealed WBC >2900 with 92% polymorphs, consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying cirrhosis, ascites, and SBP. She requires close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results to detect any signs of sepsis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's severe AS may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death. Close monitoring of her cardiac function and echocardiograms are necessary to detect any changes.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ascites may lead to respiratory complications such as pleural effusion or respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory function and oxygen saturation are necessary to detect any changes.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if not managed properly. Close monitoring of her urine output and creatinine levels are necessary to detect any changes.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or infection. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal function and laboratory results are necessary to detect any changes.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may lead to hemodynamic instability, which requires close monitoring and management.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and ascites may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which requires close monitoring and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for SBP and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor cardiac function and echocardiograms to detect any changes.
3. Monitor respiratory function and oxygen saturation to detect any changes.
4. Monitor urine output and creatinine levels to detect any changes in renal function.
5. Monitor gastrointestinal function and laboratory results to detect any changes.
6. Monitor hemodynamic instability and manage accordingly.
7. Consider referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further management of the patient's ascites and cirrhosis.
8. Consider referral to a cardiologist for further management of the patient's aortic stenosis.
9. Consider referral to a nephrologist for further management of the patient's acute on chronic renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred

   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth was due to ascites.
   Her shortness of breath was probably related to the ascites in two
   ways: (a) via a restrictive process where it is harder for her to
   inhale due to the pressure against her lungs and chest wall; and (b)
   via SBP, which increases her white count, causing anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis due to increased CO2 production, causing tachypnea to blow off
   excess CO2, causing discomfort of breathing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth was due to ascites.
   Her shortness of breath was probably related to the ascites in two
   ways: (a) via a restrictive process where it is harder for her to
   inhale due to the pressure against her lungs and chest wall; and (b)
   via SBP, which increases her white count, causing anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis due to increased CO2 production, causing tachypnea to blow off
   excess CO2, causing discomfort of breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, most consistent with spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP). The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily
   x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin
   1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro
   for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.
   The patient
s SAAG = serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3 (high gradient SAAG is >1.1), which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]). Top of the differential diagnosis for portal
   hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis. Because
   our patient has SBP,
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   consistent with transudate; total protein ascites 1.7 vs. serum 6.5
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.
   - Abdominal ultrasound with doppler
   - Ultrasound-guided paracentesis (diagnostic)
   - Liver recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**]
   - Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA
   - Urine culture, blood cultures
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline 1.7. Creatinine now 3.3.
   Differential includes ATN secondary to respond hypotensive episode
   (although patient was with renal failure prior to episode yesterday),
   prerenal etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic
   stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**] also be secondary to medications - recently started on
   HCTZ.
   - Urine lytes, UA
   - Close monitoring of urine output
   - Hold diuretics
   .
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's severe aortic stenosis and chronic renal failure.
	* Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's recent episodes of bradycardia and hypotension, which may have compromised their respiratory function.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion due to the patient's severe aortic stenosis and recent episodes of bradycardia and hypotension.
	* Myocardial infarction or ischemia due to the patient's coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the patient's acute on chronic renal failure and potential nephrotoxicity from medications.
	* Oliguria or anuria due to the patient's hypotension and potential cardiac tamponade.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Ascites or portal hypertension due to the patient's liver cirrhosis and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* Hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure due to the patient's cirrhosis and potential electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection-related Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and potential secondary infections.
	* Endocarditis or infective endarteritis due to the patient's aortic stenosis and potential bacteremia.
6. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperkalemia or hypokalemia due to the patient's chronic renal failure and potential electrolyte imbalances.
	* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes mellitus and potential insulin resistance.

The patient's current medications and treatment plan may need to be adjusted to address these potential complications and improve their overall health outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          Will consider abx if has positive infectious work-up
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          Will consider abx if has positive infectious work-up
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily

   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications have arisen:

1. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has developed SBP, which is a life-threatening infection in patients with cirrhosis. The diagnosis was made based on the presence of leukocytosis, ascites, and a high ascitic fluid protein concentration.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (ACRF): The patient has developed acute renal failure, which is likely due to ATN caused by hypotension and/or prerenal etiology. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.5 mg/dL, and she requires close monitoring of her renal function.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has developed bradycardia, which is likely caused by carvedilol toxicity. The patient's beta-blocker medication has been discontinued, and she is being monitored for signs of improvement.
4. Hypotension: The patient has developed hypotension, which has resolved with treatment. The patient's blood pressure has been stabilized, and she is no longer on dopamine.
5. Anemia: The patient has developed anemia, which may be caused by a GI bleed. She is being monitored for signs of bleeding, and a type and screen has been sent.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has developed leukocytosis, which may be caused by an infection. She is being evaluated for a source of infection, and diagnostic tests are being performed.
7. Ascites: The patient has developed ascites, which is a complication of cirrhosis. She is being monitored for signs of worsening ascites, and paracentesis has been performed to drain the fluid.

The patient's underlying conditions, including cirrhosis, diabetes, and aortic stenosis, are also being managed. She is being treated with antibiotics for SBP, and her beta-blocker medication has been discontinued due to bradycardia. She is also being monitored for signs of worsening renal function and anemia.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her underlying conditions and the presence of multiple complications. She requires close monitoring and management of her conditions to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of CAD, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI, who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and ARF. The patient's increasing abdominal girth is attributed to ascites, which was confirmed by ultrasound-guided paracentesis. The ascitic fluid analysis revealed a high number of polymorphonuclear cells (>250) with low total protein concentration (<2.5), suggesting spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily for 5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg to reduce mortality rates in patients with cirrhosis and SBP. The patient's etiology of ascites is portal hypertension, as evidenced by a high gradient SAAG (>1.1), which is associated with a high risk of developing SBP.

The patient's cirrhosis etiology is unknown, but it is likely secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) given her lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug use. The patient's MELD score is 23, which is associated with a 90% survival rate at 3 months.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure (ATN) due to ATN caused by supra-therapeutic drug action, hypotension, and prerenal etiology. The patient's creatinine has risen to 3.5, and her urine output is decreased. The patient's anemia is likely due to GI bleed, and she was started on a PPI and type and screen was sent.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, but she may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated. The patient's liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure due to decreased production of albumin.

The patient has a history of CAD s/p CABG and is on aspirin, simvastatin, and Humalog sliding scale per home regimen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrent SBP: The patient is at risk of developing recurrent SBP due to her cirrhosis and ascites.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites increase her risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, which is associated with a poor prognosis.
3. ATN: The patient's ATN may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. GI bleed: The patient's anemia may be due to a GI bleed, which needs to be monitored and managed.
5. Aortic stenosis: The patient's severe AS may progress and require intervention, such as valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement.
6. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may persist or worsen if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypotension: The patient may experience recurrent hypotension due to her liver disease and decreased production of albumin.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, and ascitic fluid total protein 1.7 vs serum
   total protein 6.5.
   Measurement of the ascetic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, where lowest
   protein concentration correlates with a highest risk of developing SBP
   because of low concentrations of opsonins.
   most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

   Patients with deficient ascitic fluid opsonic activity are predisposed
   to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

   )
   The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day
   1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3
   ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro for the rest of
   her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   consistent with transudate; total protein ascites 1.7 vs. serum 6.5
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.
   - Abdominal ultrasound with doppler
   - Ultrasound-guided paracentesis (diagnostic)
   - Liver recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**]
   - Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA
   - Urine culture, blood cultures
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Baseline 1.7. Creatinine now 3.3.
   Differential includes ATN secondary to respond hypotensive episode
   (although patient was with renal failure prior to episode yesterday),
   prerenal etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic
   stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**] also be secondary to medications - recently started on
   HCTZ.
   - Urine lytes, UA
   - Close monitoring of urine output
   - Hold diuretics
   .
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen

   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, and ascitic fluid total protein 1.7 vs serum
   total protein 6.5.
   Measurement of the ascetic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, where lowest
   protein concentration correlates with a highest risk of developing SBP
   because of low concentrations of opsonins.
   most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

   The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day
   1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3
   ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro for the rest of
   her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) after triple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). The patient was recently transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has diffuse expiratory wheezes, no crackles or rhonchi, and is breathing comfortably with a SpO2 of 96%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.9 cm2, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with preserved ejection fraction (EF), and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
* Neurological: The patient has no asterixis, CNII-XII intact, and upper and lower extremity strength 5/5 and equal bilaterally.
* Abdominal: The patient has increasing peritoneal ascites, which was confirmed by ultrasound-guided paracentesis, and is being treated with ceftriaxone and albumin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening aortic stenosis and increasing ascites
* Cardiac failure due to severe aortic stenosis and hypotension
* Renal failure due to acute on chronic renal failure and potential medication side effects
* Sepsis due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and potential secondary infections
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension
* Pulmonary embolism due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary hypertension

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Ceftriaxone and albumin for SBP
* Dopamine for hypotension
* Furosemide for fluid overload
* Aspirin for CAD
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Calcium-channel blocker for hypertension
* Atropine for bradycardia
* Monitor for signs of cardiac failure, renal failure, and sepsis

The patient's code status is full code, and discussions regarding code status are ongoing. The patient's disposition is currently CCU (cardiovascular intensive care unit) for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES.
   The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably related to the
   ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where it is harder
   for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs and chest wall;
   and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count, causing anion-gap
   metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production, causing tachypnea
   to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics is
   warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was started on
   ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]). Furthermore, patients
   with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired renal function, which
   often results in increased morbidity and mortality. By administering IV
   albumin (which expands plasma volume and increases blood flow to the
   kidneys), one reduces morality rates at three months from 41% to 22%
   (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore, our patient was also given
   albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday, and will receive an additional 1.0g/kg on
   day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term prophylaxis, the patient will
   require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life
   because it decreases incidence of SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et
   [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2119**]).
   The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   mysterious. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is also common.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely etiology because the vast
   majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension secondary to
   cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely cause given her low AFTP
   (CHF is associated with high AFTP), and
   , especially since she does not have have a history of alcohol abuse.
   it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause in our patient.
   In terms of diagnosis of ascites, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   ascetic fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES.
   The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably related to the
   ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where it is harder
   for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs and chest wall;
   and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count, causing anion-gap
   metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production, causing tachypnea
   to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics is
   warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was started on
   ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]). Furthermore, patients
   with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired renal function, which
   often results in increased morbidity and mortality. By administering IV
   albumin (which expands plasma volume and increases blood flow to the
   kidneys), one reduces morality rates at three months from 41% to 22%
   (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore, our patient was also given
   albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday, and will receive an additional 1.0g/kg on
   day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term prophylaxis, the patient will
   require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life
   because it decreases incidence of SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et
   [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2119**]).
   The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   mysterious. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is also common.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely etiology because the vast
   majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension secondary to
   cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely cause given her low AFTP
   (CHF is associated with high AFTP), and
   , especially since she does not have have a history of alcohol abuse.
   it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause in our patient.
   In terms of diagnosis of ascites, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   ascetic fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and bradycardia increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse expiratory wheezes and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of SBP and the presence of leukocytosis increase the risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: Ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days for SBP.
2. Albumin: 1.5g/kg IV daily for 2 days to improve renal function.
3. Fluid restriction: 1.5L daily to manage ascites.
4. Low-salt diet: To manage ascites and hypertension.
5. Monitoring: Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination.
6. Consultation: Consultation with cardiology, gastroenterology, and nephrology teams to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics is
   warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was started on
   ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]). Furthermore, patients
   with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired renal function, which
   often results in increased morbidity and mortality. By administering IV
   albumin (which expands plasma volume and increases blood flow to the
   kidneys), one reduces morality rates at three months from 41% to 22%
   (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore, our patient was also given
   albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday, and will receive an additional 1.0g/kg on
   day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term prophylaxis, the patient will
   require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life
   because it decreases incidence of SBP from 22% to 3.6%, without
   development of acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin (see Rolachon et
   [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2119**]).
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely etiology because the vast
   majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension secondary to
   cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely cause given her low AFTP
   (CHF is associated with high AFTP), and
   , especially since she does not have have a history of alcohol abuse.
   it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause in our patient.
   In terms of diagnosis of ascites, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   ascetic fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.

   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA

   (although patient was with renal failure prior to episode yesterday),
   prerenal etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic
   stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**] also be secondary to medications - recently started on
   HCTZ.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure. She has ascites, which was confirmed by ultrasound-guided paracentesis, and has a high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1 = 2.3) consistent with portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension may be indicative of sepsis, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's shortness of breath and diffuse expiratory wheezes may indicate respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her ascites and aortic stenosis.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's severe aortic stenosis and bradycardia may indicate cardiac failure, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ascites and portal hypertension may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and ascites may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension may increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Consider starting antibiotics to cover potential infections, such as SBP or UTI.
3. Continue to manage the patient's ascites with diuretics and albumin infusions as needed.
4. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her aortic stenosis.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting her diuretic regimen as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management of her cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
7. Continue to provide supportive care, including pain management and glycemic control, as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to [**Male First Name (un) **] bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit. Therefore, treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics
   is warranted unless further susceptibility can be found. Therefore, our
   patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   She was also started on albumin 1.5g/kg, because
. (look this up)
   She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will
   need to continue regular cipro for the rest of her life to prevent
   recurrence.
   In terms of long-term prophylaxis, there was astudy (below
   single weekly dose of 750 mg of [1]ciprofloxacin [[2]32]. In this
   trial, 60 patients with cirrhosis and a low ascitic fluid protein
   concentration (
1.5 g/dL) were randomly assigned to weekly
   ciprofloxacin or placebo for six months. There was a significant
   decrease in the incidence of SBP with ciprofloxacin (3.6 versus 22
   percent) without the development of acquired resistance to
   ciprofloxacin.
   Ciprofloxacin and long-term prevention of spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis: results of a prospective controlled trial.

   SO
   Hepatology [**2119**] [**Month (only) **];22(4 Pt 1):1171-4.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([3]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[4]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to [**Male First Name (un) **] bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit. Therefore, treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics
   is warranted unless further susceptibility can be found. Therefore, our
   patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   She was also started on albumin 1.5g/kg, because
. (look this up)
   She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will
   need to continue regular cipro for the rest of her life to prevent
   recurrence.
   In terms of long-term prophylaxis, there was astudy (below
   single weekly dose of 750 mg of [1]ciprofloxacin [[2]32]. In this
   trial, 60 patients with cirrhosis and a low ascitic fluid protein
   concentration (
1.5 g/dL) were randomly assigned to weekly
   ciprofloxacin or placebo for six months. There was a significant
   decrease in the incidence of SBP with ciprofloxacin (3.6 versus 22
   percent) without the development of acquired resistance to
   ciprofloxacin.
   Ciprofloxacin and long-term prevention of spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis: results of a prospective controlled trial.

   SO
   Hepatology [**2119**] [**Month (only) **];22(4 Pt 1):1171-4.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([3]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[4]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   consistent with transudate; total protein ascites 1.7 vs. serum 6.5
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). She was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's ascites is attributed to portal hypertension, and the ascitic fluid total protein concentration is 1.7 g/dL, consistent with transudate. The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was also started on albumin 1.5g/kg to treat the ascites.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 19.0
* Hct: 32.6
* Plt: 172
* Cr: 3.3
* Glucose: 160
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 18.7/33.3/1.7, ALT/AST: 12-11, Alk Phos/T Bili: 54/0.7, Differential-Neuts: 91.2%, Lymph: 6.5%, Mono: 2.2%, Eos: 0.1%, Albumin: 3.7 g/dL, LDH: 141 IU/L, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 5.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: Resting comfortably with head of bed elevated 30 degrees.
* Skin: Not jaundiced. Mild erythema at nasal bridge, cheeks. No palmar erythema. No spider angiomata. No caput.
* HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. EOMI. Conjunctiva pale.
* Neck: Supple. No appreciable JVD (exam limited by body habitus).
* Cardiac: RRR, normal S1, quiet S2; III/VI holosystolic murmur loudest at LUSB.
* Lungs: Diffuse expiratory wheezes; no crackles, rhonchi appreciated.
* Abdomen: Obese; visible hernia below right breast, periumbilical; soft, nontender. Dull to percussion, unable to appreciate fluid wave.
* Extremities: No lower extremity edema. Radial, DP pulses 2+.
* Neuro: No asterixis; CNII-XII intact; EOMI; upper and lower extremity strength 5/5 and equal bilaterally.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of SBP and leukocytosis, there is a risk of sepsis developing.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of AKI worsening if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis and bradycardia may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse expiratory wheezes and potential respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilation.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ascites and cirrhosis may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
6. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of ascites make her susceptible to infections.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her ascites, SBP, and underlying medical conditions to prevent these potential complications."

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ascites and worsening liver function. The patient underwent ultrasound-guided paracentesis, removing 1.4L of peritoneal fluid consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is receiving ceftriaxone for 5 days and albumin infusions. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, type II diabetes, and chronic pain. The patient is currently experiencing right shoulder pain and has a known allergy to sulfa and iodine.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine levels are elevated (3.5 mg/dL), and the patient is experiencing prerenal azotemia. The patient's urine sodium levels are low, which may indicate prerenal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. **Infection:** The patient has a history of SBP and is receiving antibiotics. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated (19.0 K/uL), which may indicate an ongoing infection. Monitoring of the patient's infection status and adjusting antibiotics as necessary is crucial.
3. **Pain Management:** The patient is experiencing right shoulder pain and is being treated with Tylenol. The patient's pain levels should be closely monitored to ensure adequate pain control and prevent further complications.
4. **Diabetes Management:** The patient has a history of type II diabetes and is currently experiencing hyperglycemia (160 mg/dL). Tight glycemic control is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and is experiencing mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. **Nutritional Deficiencies:** The patient is receiving albumin infusions, but the patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored to prevent further deficiencies.
7. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's liver function is worsening, and the patient is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and liver function is necessary to prevent this complication.
8. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's PT and PTT levels are elevated, which may indicate a coagulopathy. Close monitoring of the patient's coagulation status is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue antibiotics for SBP and monitor the patient's infection status closely.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adjusting antibiotics as necessary.
3. Continue pain management with Tylenol and monitor the patient's pain levels closely.
4. Tight glycemic control is necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Continue albumin infusions and monitor the patient's nutritional status closely.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and liver function closely to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely to prevent bleeding complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of unknown. They have a history of allergies to amoxicillin, sulfa, and iodine, which caused a rash. The patient received ceftriaxone antibiotics until 2134-5-21 08:12 PM. They are currently receiving various ICU medications and infusions.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.4°C (99.3°F), current temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate 51 (44-65) bpm, blood pressure 113/46 (63) mmHg, respiratory rate 21 (16-29) inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 19.0
* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 172
* Creatinine: 3.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 160 mg/dL
* Other lab results include PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, differential neutrophil count, and other electrolyte levels.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to not being assessed in certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and others.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with acute pain, chronic pain, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, aortic stenosis, and ascites. They have a knowledge deficit and are receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and lines. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.3 mg/dL, which may indicate a worsening of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid management is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is 19.0, which may indicate an infection. Cultures should be obtained to determine the cause of the infection and appropriate antibiotics should be administered.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 160 mg/dL, which may indicate hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of glucose levels and adjustment of insulin dosing is necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, which may indicate respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjustment of oxygen therapy is necessary.
5. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of inflammatory markers, which may indicate sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis and sinus bradycardia may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure. Close monitoring of cardiac status and adjustment of medication is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute kidney injury, ascites, and aortic stenosis. The patient has undergone an ultrasound-guided paracentesis, which removed 1.4 liters of peritoneal fluid consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The patient has been prescribed ceftriaxone for 5 days and albumin for 1.5 grams per kilogram.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 51 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 113/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The patient's neurological status is also stable, with no signs of asterixis, CNII-XII intact, and upper and lower extremity strength of 5/5 and equal bilaterally.

The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, sulfa, and iodine-containing products. The patient has also had a recent urine analysis with blood, moderate leukocytosis, and a Foley catheter removed.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 19.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 172 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 54 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase of 0.7 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's ascites may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's acute kidney injury may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, coma, and death if not managed properly.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's ascites may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, and peritonitis if not managed properly.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which may lead to hematological complications such as bleeding, anemia, and thrombocytopenia if not managed properly.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's ascites may lead to nutritional complications such as malnutrition, wasting, and weakness if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) post-triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was transferred to the ICU from the outside hospital with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has diffuse expiratory wheezes and is receiving room air with a SpO2 of 96%.
* Cardiovascular: She has severe AS with a valve area of 0.9cm2, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with preserved ejection fraction (EF), and a peak gradient of ~80 and mean gradient of ~50.
* Gastrointestinal: She has ascites with a high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1 = 2.3) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is being treated with ceftriaxone and albumin.
* Renal: She has AKI with a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL, and her calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with a 90% survival rate at 3 months.
* Hematological: She has anemia with a hematocrit drop from 32 to 25, and a type and screen has been sent to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Endocrine: She has diabetes mellitus type II, and her blood glucose level is 133 mg/dL.
* Hepatic: She has cirrhosis with a bilirubin level of 0.7 mg/dL and an INR of 1.7.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's advanced liver disease and AKI, there is a risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, which has a poor prognosis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's AKI may progress to renal failure, which could further compromise her already compromised liver function.
3. Infection: The patient's SBP and ascites increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's severe AS and LVH may lead to cardiac complications, such as dyspnea, angina, or syncope.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further complications, such as hematemesis or melena.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's diffuse expiratory wheezes and AKI may lead to respiratory failure, which could further compromise her already compromised cardiovascular and renal function.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing ceftriaxone and albumin for SBP and ascites
* Monitoring her creatinine and urine output to assess for AKI and potential hepatorenal syndrome
* Trending her bilirubin and INR to assess for liver function
* Holding beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers due to bradycardia and hypotension
* Consulting nephrology and hepatology for further management
* Guaiac testing her stools to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding
* Continuing aspirin, simvastatin, and Humalog sliding scale per home regimen
* Fluid restriction and electrolyte repletion as needed
* Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results to adjust her plan of care accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, triple coronary artery bypass grafting, cirrhosis, type II diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cardiogenic shock, and her condition has been stabilized.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 25.9%
* Platelet count: 114 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 17 mg/dL
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: potassium (4.5 mEq/L), sodium (134 mEq/L), chloride (108 mEq/L)

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
* Heart rate: 57 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 151/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Bradycardia with a heart rate of 50 beats per minute while sleeping
* Hypotension with a blood pressure of 151/55 mmHg
* Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.0 K/uL
* No signs of peripheral edema or ascites

The patient's medical history and current medications are:

* Coronary artery disease with triple coronary artery bypass grafting
* Cirrhosis
* Type II diabetes
* Hypertension
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Current medications: ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, heparin, and simvastatin

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hepato-renal syndrome (HRS)
* Septicemia due to ceftriaxone-resistant bacteria
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Hypotension due to sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or medication side effects
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing ceftriaxone for 5 days
* Albumin infusion
* Ciprofloxacin for 7 days after ceftriaxone is discontinued
* Transfer to liver service
* Low-salt diet and fluid restriction
* Holding anti-hypertensive medications
* Monitoring of creatinine and urine output
* Trending of daily hematocrit levels

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications, and to optimize the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI. She was transferred from an outside hospital with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and ARF. She is currently in the ICU with ongoing care for her acute pain, renal failure, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has decreased to 50 bpm while sleeping, which may be a sign of increased vagal tone or medication effect. Monitoring on telemetry and holding anti-HTN medication may be necessary.
	* Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe AS, which may lead to cardiac complications such as angina, syncope, or heart failure.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.4 mg/dL, which is an increase from her baseline of 1.7 mg/dL. Monitoring of UOP and trending of creatinine levels are necessary.
	* Pre-renal Azotemia: The patient's urine sediment shows many casts, which is suggestive of ATN. Monitoring of UOP and trending of creatinine levels are necessary.
3. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 32 to 25, which may be a sign of bleeding or bone marrow suppression. Trending of hematocrit levels and monitoring for signs of bleeding are necessary.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is 19.0 K/uL, which may be a sign of infection. Monitoring of WBC count and trending of infectious markers such as CRP and ESR are necessary.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Ascites: The patient has mild distension and dullness to percussion in the abdomen, which may be a sign of ascites. Monitoring of abdominal girth and trending of ascites fluid levels are necessary.
6. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hypoxia: The patient's SpO2 is 97%, which may be a sign of hypoxia. Monitoring of SpO2 and trending of respiratory markers such as PaO2 and PaCO2 are necessary.
7. Metabolic Complications:
	* Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has DMII, which may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or ketoacidosis. Monitoring of glucose levels and trending of insulin sensitivity are necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and ensure optimal care."

 ASCITES
 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold lasix
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen

   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold lasix
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's shortness of breath and tachypnea may worsen due to the accumulation of ascites, which can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's SBP and ascites increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's ATN and potential prerenal azotemia may worsen, leading to AKI.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and ascites increase the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, which can lead to acute renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's SBP and ascites increase the risk of secondary bacterial peritonitis, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis and bradycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even sudden cardiac death.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and guaiac-positive stools suggest a potential GI bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
8. Dehydration: The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output may worsen, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
9. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's decreased urine output and potential AKI may lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's ascites and potential GI bleeding may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her overall condition.

The patient's current medications and treatments aim to address these potential complications, including antibiotics for SBP, diuretics for ascites, and vasopressors for hypotension. However, close monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to prevent and manage these complications effectively."
