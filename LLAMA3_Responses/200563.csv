You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to non-compliance with medications. He has a history of diabetes, chronic heart failure, end-stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and has undergone hemodialysis (HD) with a clotted graft. In the ER, his initial vitals were stable, with a blood glucose level of 580 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 25 mEq/L, and anion gap of 23. He was started on IV insulin, vancomycin, and zosyn. In the ICU, his vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/74 mmHg. He has a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's DKA is likely due to medication non-compliance and pneumonia. His electrolytes are replete, and his insulin drip is being weaned. The pneumonia is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn. The patient's elevated troponin level and subtle EKG changes suggest ongoing cardiac instability, and beta blockers will be continued. The failed AV fistula will be discussed with surgery tomorrow, and the patient will undergo HD if access is straightened out.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows a possible right lower lobe infiltrate, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
2. Cardiac instability: The patient's elevated troponin level and subtle EKG changes suggest ongoing cardiac instability, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient's DKA and pneumonia increase his risk of developing secondary infections, such as sepsis or septic shock.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is being monitored closely, but he may still be at risk for fluid overload if his diuresis is inadequate.
5. Graft failure: The patient's clotted graft may lead to further complications if not addressed promptly, including the need for emergency surgery.
6. Medication non-compliance: The patient's non-compliance with medications may lead to further complications if not addressed through education and support.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   DKA - likely due to med noncompliance and pneumonia, gap has already
   closed, replete lytes, wean insulin drip
   pneumonia - treat with vanco/zosyn
   elevated troponin, subtle EKG changes - continue beta blockers, follow
   EKG
   failed AV fistula - discuss with surgery tomorrow
   ESRD - hopefully access straightened out and can undergo HD tomorrow
   steroid use - will straighten out daily dose in the AM

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of DKA, who was unable to undergo hemodialysis (HD) due to a clotted graft and hyperglycemia. He has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and has been noncompliant with his medications. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of DKA and pneumonia, and was started on IV insulin, vancomycin, and zosyn. He is currently receiving insulin infusions and has had a gap in his treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of DKA: The patient's hyperglycemia and lack of insulin therapy may lead to further complications, such as acidosis, coma, or even death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or even death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and subtle EKG changes may indicate cardiac damage, which could lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and failed AV fistula may lead to further kidney damage, necessitating dialysis or even renal replacement therapy.
5. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to ESRD and steroid use may increase his risk of developing infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
6. Vascular complications: The patient's PVD may increase his risk of developing vascular complications, such as limb ischemia or gangrene.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV insulin infusions and monitor glucose levels closely.
2. Continue antibiotic therapy for pneumonia and monitor for signs of improvement or worsening.
3. Continue beta blocker therapy to manage cardiac symptoms and monitor for signs of cardiac damage.
4. Discuss with surgery the possibility of repairing the failed AV fistula.
5. Monitor for signs of infection and sepsis, and treat promptly if necessary.
6. Consider additional imaging studies, such as echocardiogram or CT scan, to further evaluate cardiac and vascular complications.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid status and electrolyte levels closely, and adjust therapy as necessary."

   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia. Gap initially 23.
   - Insulin gtt per protocol with q1h fsbs, then transition back to
   lantus with ISS
   - NPO for now
   - NS @ 100c/h + K (conservative given potential for fluid overload in
   this HD pt awaiting access) -> D5NS when FSG <200
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] c/s in AM
   - Holding po steroids for now given aspiration risk with altered mental
   status. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 276**] PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] by Rheum and unclear whether this has
   benefited his glycemic control. Could give low dose IV steroids
   (methylpred 20mg) if concern for BP but otherwise ok to hold overnight
   - Low dose insulin gtt for now with D5W
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on exam.
   - Cont Vanc, zosyn, cipro for double coverage
 plan for short course
   unless clear signs of infection
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx
   .
   # Elevated trop: Likely demand in the setting of DKA in this pt with
   ESRD as CK elevated; pt does have TWI which is consistent with past EKG
   changes associated with demand.
   - Trend CE, tele, repeat EKG in AM
   - Restart aspirin if cleared by surgery
   .
   # Nonworking AVF: presumed rethrombosed
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Will take to OR in AM if medically stable
   .
   # ESRD: On HD, missed session today.  No acute indication for HD - mild
   hyperkalemia in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level.
   Satting well currently.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above prior to HD
   .
   # HTN: Controlled currently.
   - Restart home BP meds (see below)
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   .
   # Medication rec: Holding on home po meds for now which pt takes in AM
   given concern for aspiration with poor mental status.
   - metoprolol 50mg tid, doxazosin 4mg qhs, diltiazem 180mg SR [**Hospital1 **],
   minoxidil 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **], levothyroxine 75mcg, rosuvastatin 20mg,

   simethicone 80mg qid prn bloating, prednisone 15mg daily (confirm
   dose), compazine 5mg q6h prn, tramadol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] prn, bisacodyl prn,
   senna prn, colace prn
   - can switch IV ppi back to omeprazole 20mg daily
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving treatment for DKA, pneumonia, and other underlying conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 136/82 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula. His physical examination is notable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally, tachycardia, and regular heart rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose, troponin, and lactic acid, as well as mild hyperkalemia. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows signs of demand ischemia, and his kidney function is impaired.

The patient is receiving treatment for DKA, including insulin and dextrose infusions, as well as antibiotics for pneumonia. He is also receiving hemodialysis and is being monitored for potential complications such as fluid overload and hypoglycemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to his DKA and pneumonia, which could lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin regimen may lead to hypoglycemia, which could cause seizures, coma, or even death.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and DKA may lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure if not properly treated.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's ECG shows signs of demand ischemia, which could lead to myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
5. Kidney damage: The patient's ESRD and impaired kidney function may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further kidney damage or even renal failure.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other systemic symptoms.
7. Aspiration risk: The patient's altered mental status and poor oral intake may increase his risk of aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia or even death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated heart failure (dCHF). He was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 136/82 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Blood glucose: 53 mg/dL
* Potassium: 3.6 mEq/L
* Sodium: 149 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 7.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.31 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: Alert, oriented, and arousable to voice
* HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, and oropharynx clear
* Neck: Supple, unable to assess jugular venous distension (JVD), no lymphadenopathy (LAD)
* Lungs: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally
* CV: Regular rate, tachycardic, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding
* Extremities: Warm, well-perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema

The patient's medical conditions and plan include:

* DKA: Insulin gtt per protocol, NPO, and IV fluids (D5NS) pending further evaluation
* Pneumonia: Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, pending sputum and blood cultures
* Elevated troponin-T: Likely due to demand in the setting of DKA, with low suspicion of myocardial infarction
* Non-working AVF: Presumed rethrombosed, with plans for surgical intervention
* ESRD: On hemodialysis, with plans for access in the morning
* HTN: Controlled, with holding of usual oral BP medications
* Hypothyroidism: Check TSH due to increased fatigue
* Medication reconciliation: Holding of home medications, pending further evaluation
* FEN: No IV fluids, replete electrolytes, and regular diet
* Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
* Access: Peripherals
* Communication: Patient has been DNR/DNI in the past, but uncertain of current feelings
* Code: Full, with discussions with HCP
* Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions and plan include:

* Worsening of DKA, leading to further metabolic decompensation
* Development of sepsis or septic shock from pneumonia
* Myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias due to elevated troponin-T
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury from hemodialysis or underlying ESRD
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism from subcutaneous heparin
* Aspiration or respiratory failure due to altered mental status and poor oral intake
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy or medication errors
* Infection or sepsis from central lines or peripheral IV access
* Cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death due to underlying heart disease or electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for DKA, pneumonia, and elevated troponin levels. The patient has a non-working arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and is awaiting access for hemodialysis (HD). He is also being treated for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA is being managed with insulin therapy, but there is a risk of recurrence if the patient does not comply with treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), but there is a risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.
3. Elevated Troponin Levels: The patient's elevated troponin levels may be due to demand in the setting of DKA, but there is a risk of cardiac complications if the troponin levels do not improve.
4. Non-Working AVF: The patient's non-working AVF is a risk factor for complications during HD, including bleeding and infection.
5. ESRD: The patient's ESRD increases his risk of developing complications during HD, including electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may be contributing to his fatigue and other symptoms, and it is important to monitor his thyroid function closely.
7. Medication Overload: The patient is taking multiple medications, which increases his risk of medication interactions and side effects.
8. Aspiration Risk: The patient's altered mental status and poor oral intake increase his risk of aspiration, which is a serious complication that requires close monitoring.
9. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload is a risk factor for complications during HD, including bleeding and infection.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease and elevated troponin levels increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated heart failure (dCHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has a non-working graft, presumed rethrombosed, and is scheduled for a fistula thrombectomy today. His current condition is stable, with a gap in his insulin therapy leading to hyperglycemia. He is also being treated for pneumonia, with a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which are likely due to ESRD rather than myocardial infarction. He has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and immunosuppression, and is currently receiving prednisone. His capacity to make decisions is limited due to his disease condition and lack of a safe place to go.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his immunosuppressed state and recent hospitalizations.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin therapy may lead to hypoglycemia if not properly managed.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia may worsen if not properly managed, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or arrest.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if not properly managed, potentially leading to respiratory or cardiac complications.
5. Graft Failure: The patient's non-working graft may fail to reperfuse, leading to further complications.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of dCHF and elevated troponin levels may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not properly treated, potentially leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
8. Thrombosis: The patient's elevated risk of thrombosis may worsen if not properly managed, potentially leading to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: presumed rethrombosed.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Plan for OR today for fistula thrombectomy
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access but does not need temp line.  Last HD prior to
   admission. Satting well currently.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy; If graft can
t be revised or will not
   be able to be used today, should have temp line placed in OR so he can
   be dialyzed today.
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Insulin SS as written with 10 u Lantus QAm and 6 untis QPM.
   - Safest to continue insulin gtt in the perioperative period and until
   patient tolerating PO diet/fluids.
   - Pt also not allowing us to check frequent electrolytes to ensure
   stability.
   - Will start insulin gtt at 1 unit/hour and D5 @ 50ml/hr with goal to
   come off [**Name (NI) 2587**] (pt becomes aggravated with frequent FS).
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE)
   - F/U vanco trough from this morning (vanco will be dosed QHD
 will
   confirm order)
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - Without culture data, will likely stop antibiotics at 48 hours
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # HTN: Controlled currently.
   - Restarted home BP meds, but being held until after HD
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday).
   Indication unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] attempt to confirm with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian.
   - If patient reiterates desire to leaving AMA, will contact son to come
   in and speak to patient.  Prior to patient leaving hospital AMA, would
   need psychiatry to evaluate for capacity.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been non-compliant with insulin and has developed hyperglycemia, which may have been exacerbated by pneumonia or other infection.

The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is awaiting a fistula thrombectomy procedure. He is currently receiving insulin via a continuous infusion and has a gap in his medication regimen, including his home dose of prednisone.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute (bpm). His oxygen saturation is 100% and his cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 372 K/uL. His creatinine level is 7.3 mg/dL, and his troponin level is 0.31 ng/mL.

The patient has a history of non-compliance with his medication regimen and has refused to take his medications, including his insulin. He has also refused to allow his vital signs to be monitored and has threatened to leave against medical advice (AMA).

The patient's medical team is concerned about his lack of compliance with his medication regimen and his refusal to allow his vital signs to be monitored. They are also concerned about his risk of developing complications, including pneumonia, and his need for further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of non-compliance with his medication regimen and his refusal to allow his vital signs to be monitored may increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of DKA and his current hyperglycemia may increase his risk of developing further episodes of DKA.
3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's history of ESRD and his current kidney function may increase his risk of developing further complications, including dialysis dependence.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has a non-functioning graft, presumed rethrombosed, and is scheduled for a fistula thrombectomy procedure today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg. He is receiving insulin infusions and has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which are likely due to ESRD, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are stable, and his platelet count is normal.

The patient has a history of non-compliance with his insulin regimen, which has led to hyperglycemia and DKA. He has also been non-compliant with his blood pressure medications, which has resulted in hypertension.

The patient's medical team is concerned about his capacity to make informed decisions about his care, given his limited insight into his disease process and lack of a safe place to go. His son serves as his limited guardian.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing further infections, particularly in the setting of DKA.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin regimen may lead to hypoglycemia if not properly managed.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's ESRD and DKA may lead to hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's dCHF and hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD may lead to further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's DKA may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or altered mental status.
7. Graft failure: The patient's non-functioning graft may fail, leading to further complications.

The patient's care plan includes close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition. He will receive insulin infusions and antibiotics for pneumonia, and his blood pressure will be closely monitored and treated as necessary. The patient's capacity to make informed decisions about his care will be reassessed regularly, and his son will continue to serve as his limited guardian."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and decompensated heart failure (dCHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient has been non-compliant with insulin therapy, which has led to hyperglycemia, and has also developed pneumonia, which is being treated with Zosyn. His troponin levels are elevated, but it is likely due to his ESRD rather than cardiac ischemia.

The patient has a non-functioning arteriovenous fistula (AVF) that is presumed to have rethrombosed, and he is scheduled for a fistula thrombectomy today. He has mild hyperkalemia, which is likely not reflective of his true potassium level due to his DKA.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently well-controlled, and hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine. He has limited capacity and has threatened to leave against medical advice (AMA) in the past due to his lack of insight into his disease condition and lack of a safe place to go. His son serves as his limited guardian.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His lab results show mild anemia, hyperglycemia, and mild hyperkalemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of heart failure may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and mild hyperkalemia may increase his risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of his renal function.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and DKA may increase his risk of developing secondary infections, such as sepsis or septic shock.
4. Thrombotic complications: The patient's non-functioning AVF and history of PVD may increase his risk of developing thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of DKA and non-compliance with insulin therapy may increase his risk of developing hypoglycemia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure his safe transition to the next stage of his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12090**] with a history of limited insight into their disease process and no fixed address. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently receiving treatment for various conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Their hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac index of 2.45 liters per minute and a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of 18 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and troponin-T, indicating inflammation and potential cardiac damage. Their blood glucose levels are elevated, and they require insulin therapy to control their glucose levels.

The patient's plan includes a fistula thrombectomy scheduled for [**2128-3-4**], as well as the administration of various medications, including beta blockers, statins, and prednisone. They are also receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and cardiac index suggest potential cardiac damage, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest potential respiratory complications, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of limited insight into their disease process and potential cardiac damage suggest potential neurological complications, which can lead to cognitive impairment and death.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and potential cardiac damage suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their condition to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: presumed rethrombosed.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Plan for OR today for fistula thrombectomy
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access but does not need temp line.  Last HD prior to
   admission. Satting well currently.
   - Trend lytes
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed.  FS over last 12 hours range 69-157.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Insulin SS as written with 10 u Lantus QAm and 6 untis QPM
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE)
   - F/U vanco trough from this morning (vanco will be dosed QHD
 will
   confirm order)
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # HTN: Controlled currently.
   - Restarted home BP meds (will hold today because going for HD)
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production. Will attempt to confirm with PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian.
   - Consider psych eval this morning
   .
   .
   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will re-evaluate

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease, and decompensated heart failure (dCHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been noncompliant with insulin therapy, which has led to hyperglycemia. The patient has a nonworking graft, presumed to be rethrombosed, and is scheduled for a fistula thrombectomy. He also has pneumonia, which is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/81 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 29 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100%. He has a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 372 K/uL.

The patient has been refusing medications, including insulin, and has threatened to leave the hospital against medical advice (AMA). However, he has a history of not being able to leave AMA due to limited insight into his disease process and lack of a safe place to go. His son serves as his limited guardian.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening DKA: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if he continues to be noncompliant with insulin therapy.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, which may worsen if not properly treated.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's nonworking graft is presumed to be rethrombosed, which may lead to further complications if not addressed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, but may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may worsen if not properly treated.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient is taking immunosuppressive medications, which may increase his risk of infection.
7. Capacity issues: The patient's lack of capacity to make informed decisions may lead to further complications if not properly addressed.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure if not properly treated.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's decompensated heart failure may worsen if not properly managed.
10. Kidney damage: The patient's ESRD may worsen if not properly managed."

   -FYI: patient home dose lasix 20mg being held
   -plan for graft revision as an add on case for OR on [**2128-3-5**]
   -NPO after midnight, coags in AM, repeat vancomycin level
   -pt continues on dextrose drip and insulin gtt
   -pt hypotensive to SBP 75 after receiving minoxidil.  Received 250ml NS
   bolus. Now refusing blood pressures.
   -Pt progressively refusing more care; first no blood pressures, then no
   finger sticks (insulin gtt off, last check 132), now removed monitor
   leads.
   PSYCH RECS (INITIAL):
-For now, pursue with procedures to which pt and HCP agree
-If he continues to refuse treatment, should consult legal
towards modifying guardianship to include substituted judgment.
Though he lacks capacity, we cannot take him to surgery without
having a judge declare him incompetent.  Continued discussion of
alternative options around his care, such that if he agrees to a
recommended treatment to which his HCP also agrees, would do it.
-Both pt's sister and father state that, were he thinking
clearly, he would want to have HD and would also agree to the
surgery to revise the graft; this has been witnessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 391**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11073**] and by the primary team
-[**Month (only) 60**] use low dose quetiapine 12.5-25mg for agitation
-Pt cannot leave AMA
PSYCH RECS (FOLLOW-UP):
1) speak with his [**Last Name (LF) 1612**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to confirm their support of surgery/treatment as
he is agreeing to care
2) in general, given his cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guard
[**Doctor First Name **] appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing faci
lity) given his processing difficulties and repeated problems with poor self car
3) he does not appear immediately at risk for suicide or harm to others and his
statements are more reflective of his frustration and mild confusion than true i
ntent to end his life

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   -NPO after midnight, coags in AM, repeat vancomycin level
   -pt continues on dextrose drip and insulin gtt
   -pt hypotensive to SBP 75 after receiving minoxidil.  Received 250ml NS
   bolus. Now refusing blood pressures.
   -Pt progressively refusing more care; first no blood pressures, then no
   finger sticks (insulin gtt off, last check 132), now removed monitor
   leads.
   PSYCH RECS (INITIAL):
-For now, pursue with procedures to which pt and HCP agree
-If he continues to refuse treatment, should consult legal
towards modifying guardianship to include substituted judgment.
Though he lacks capacity, we cannot take him to surgery without
having a judge declare him incompetent.  Continued discussion of
alternative options around his care, such that if he agrees to a
recommended treatment to which his HCP also agrees, would do it.
-Both pt's sister and father state that, were he thinking
clearly, he would want to have HD and would also agree to the
surgery to revise the graft; this has been witnessed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 391**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11073**] and by the primary team
-[**Month (only) 60**] use low dose quetiapine 12.5-25mg for agitation
-Pt cannot leave AMA
PSYCH RECS (FOLLOW-UP):
1) speak with his [**Last Name (LF) 1612**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] to confirm their support of surgery/treatment as
he is agreeing to care
2) in general, given his cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guard
[**Doctor First Name **] appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing faci
lity) given his processing difficulties and repeated problems with poor self car
3) he does not appear immediately at risk for suicide or harm to others and his
statements are more reflective of his frustration and mild confusion than true i
ntent to end his life

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Awaiting repeat procedure in OR
   today. Will need temp line placement if not able to secure working
   graft. Renal team aware
 no acute need for HD given electrolytes from
   yesterday PM so have held off overnight.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Plan for OR today for graft repair, ? temp line placement
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access.  Last HD prior to admission.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy via functioning graft or temporary HD
   line
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs). Last 5 FS all in 100s range; pt refused further FS overnight.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Currently off insulin gtt, no sliding scale active at this time
   - will try to start his home dose insulin regimen when patient is able
   to eat
   - trend electrolytes if possible
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE); will consider discontinuing antibiotics and
   following up with a CXR as outpatient for any interval change.
   - F/U vanco level from yesterday afternoon elevated to 152, likely
   artifact. Will attempt re-check today if patient will agree to labs
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - discuss today
s CXR with radiology re: RLL opacity
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home BP meds for now
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now

   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF) who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He underwent a thrombectomy and graft revision in the operating room (OR) on [**2128-3-4**] and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate 104 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 51/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute (bpm), and oxygen saturation 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is hypotensive and refusing blood pressures.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 2,071 mL of fluids and has a total fluid balance of 1,796 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 11.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 10.6 g/dL, platelet count is 372 x 10^9/L, creatinine is 7.4 mg/dL, and troponin-T is 0.31 ng/mL.
* Assessment and plan:
	+ Non-working graft: The patient's graft is presumed to be rethrombosed and is awaiting a repeat procedure in the OR today.
	+ ESRD: The patient does not have an acute indication for hemodialysis (HD) and is currently without access.
	+ DKA: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to non-compliance with insulin and may also be precipitated by pneumonia or other infection.
	+ Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).
	+ Elevated troponin: The patient's elevated troponin level is likely due to ESRD.
	+ Blood pressure: The patient is hypotensive and refusing blood pressures.
	+ Immunosuppression: The patient is taking prednisone for insulin antibody production.
	+ Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level should be checked due to complaints of increased fatigue.
	+ Capacity: The patient is unable to make decisions about his own care and has been declared to lack capacity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Graft failure: The patient's graft is presumed to be rethrombosed and may not function properly, leading to a need for repeat procedures or temporary dialysis.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his underlying conditions and hospitalization.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, may become imbalanced due to his underlying conditions and treatment.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for developing hypoglycemia due to his diabetes and treatment with insulin.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease may worsen due to his underlying conditions and treatment.
* Respiratory complications: The patient may develop respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to his underlying conditions and hospitalization.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-thrombectomy and has undergone graft revision as an add-on case for OR on [**2128-3-5**]. The patient has been receiving dextrose drip and insulin gtt, but has been refusing more care, including blood pressures, finger sticks, and monitor leads. The patient has a history of allergies to Tapazole (Oral) and has received multiple antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37°C, Tcurrent of 36.8°C, HR of 104 bpm, BP of 51/59 mmHg, RR of 14 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 97%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's BP is 51/59 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension. Further monitoring and potential treatment with vasopressors may be necessary.
2. Blood Pressure Refusal: The patient's refusal of blood pressures may indicate a potential issue with blood pressure monitoring or a concern about the procedure. Further evaluation and reassurance may be necessary.
3. Insulin Infusion: The patient is receiving an insulin gtt, which may indicate hyperglycemia. Further monitoring of glucose levels and potential adjustments to the insulin infusion may be necessary.
4. Catabolic State: The patient's high glucose levels and low blood sugar may indicate a catabolic state. Further evaluation and potential treatment with nutrition and insulin may be necessary.
5. Infection: The patient has received multiple antibiotics, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Further evaluation and potential treatment with antibiotics may be necessary.
6. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and potential treatment with anticoagulants may be necessary.
7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and potential bleeding. Further evaluation and potential treatment with antacids or proton pump inhibitors may be necessary.
8. VAP Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for VAP due to intubation and potential bacterial colonization. Further evaluation and potential treatment with antibiotics may be necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values.
2. Consider further evaluation of the patient's blood pressure and potential treatment with vasopressors.
3. Adjust the insulin infusion as necessary to maintain normoglycemia.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's infection and potential treatment with antibiotics.
5. Continue DVT prophylaxis and consider further evaluation and treatment with anticoagulants.
6. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and consider further evaluation and treatment with antacids or proton pump inhibitors.
7. Continue VAP prophylaxis and consider further evaluation and treatment with antibiotics."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-thrombectomy patient who has undergone graft revision surgery. The patient is experiencing hypotension, with a systolic blood pressure of 75 mmHg, and has been given a 250ml NS bolus. The patient is refusing blood pressures and has removed their monitor leads. The patient's sister and father have expressed their support for the patient's treatment plan, including having the patient undergo hemodialysis and surgery to revise the graft.

The patient has a history of allergies to Tapazole and has received various antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels.

The patient is currently receiving dextrose drip and insulin gtt, and their vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 104 bpm, blood pressure 0/51 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus tachycardia and a fluid balance of 1,796 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure of 75 mmHg is a concern, and the patient may require further fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of allergies to antibiotics and has received various antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient has undergone graft revision surgery and may be at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which may indicate kidney dysfunction.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving dextrose drip and insulin gtt, which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, which may indicate respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and fluid overload may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and consider further fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust their antibiotic regimen as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and consider platelet transfusion if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust their insulin regimen as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider cardiology consultation if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Awaiting repeat procedure in OR
   today. Will need temp line placement if not able to secure working
   graft. Renal team aware
 no acute need for HD given electrolytes from
   yesterday PM so have held off overnight.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Plan for OR today for graft repair, ? temp line placement
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access.  Last HD prior to admission.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs). Last 5 FS all in 100s range; pt refused further FS overnight.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Currently off insulin gtt, no sliding scale active at this time
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE)
   - F/U vanco level from yesterday afternoon elevated to 152, likely
   artifact. Will attempt re-check today if patient will agree to labs
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - F/U CXR if patient will allow
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home BP meds for now
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient may need
   guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   .
   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Awaiting repeat procedure in OR
   today. Will need temp line placement if not able to secure working
   graft. Renal team aware
 no acute need for HD given electrolytes from
   yesterday PM so have held off overnight.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Plan for OR today for graft repair, ? temp line placement
   .
   # ESRD:  Per renal team, no acute indication for HD (mild hyperkalemia
   seen in setting of DKA is likely not reflective of true level).
   Currently without access.  Last HD prior to admission.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Renal aware, will need to obtain access as above
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Plan for HD after thrombectomy
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs). Last 5 FS all in 100s range; pt refused further FS overnight.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Currently off insulin gtt, no sliding scale active at this time
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile.
   - On Vanco/Zosyn; plan for short course unless sx of worsening infxn
   (should define in POE)
   - F/U vanco level from yesterday afternoon elevated to 152, likely
   artifact. Will attempt re-check today if patient will agree to labs
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx (NGTD)
   - F/U CXR if patient will allow
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home BP meds for now
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this morning to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient may need
   guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   .
   # FEN: 75 cc/hr D5W until after surgery, replete electrolytes (K only
   if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
 will re-evaluate

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes insipidus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and has undergone a thrombectomy and graft revision in the operating room (OR) on [**2128-3-4**].

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 75 mmHg, which was treated with a 250ml normal saline (NS) bolus.
* He is refusing further blood pressure checks and has removed his monitor leads.
* His glucose levels are elevated, and he is off insulin therapy.
* He has a non-working graft, which was presumed to have re-thrombosed, and is awaiting a repeat procedure in the OR today.
* He has mild hyperkalemia, which is likely not reflective of his true level due to DKA.
* He has pneumonia, which is being covered broadly with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
* He has elevated troponin levels, which are likely due to his ESRD.
* He is being treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine.
* He is being managed for DKA with insulin therapy, and his glucose levels are being closely monitored.
* He is being treated for hypotension with normal saline boluses and is being monitored for signs of hypovolemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Hypotension and shock due to inadequate blood pressure management
* Hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias due to elevated potassium levels
* Infection and sepsis due to pneumonia and other potential sources
* Cardiac complications due to DKA and ESRD
* Graft failure and need for repeat thrombectomy and revision
* Hypothyroidism and potential complications from levothyroxine therapy
* DKA and potential complications from insulin therapy

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following recommendations are made:

* Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and treat hypotension with normal saline boluses as needed.
* Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
* Monitor the patient's troponin levels and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with levothyroxine therapy.
* Continue to monitor the patient's graft function and plan for repeat thrombectomy and revision as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as needed.
* Consider consultation with a cardiologist and nephrologist to optimize the patient's care.

In summary, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple comorbidities and potential complications. Close monitoring and management of his blood pressure, glucose levels, and electrolyte levels are crucial to prevent potential complications and optimize his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-thrombectomy admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has undergone multiple antibiotic infusions, including Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 161/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight decrease in blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (Hct 31.1%) and thrombocytopenia (Plt 317 K/uL). The patient's renal function is mildly impaired, with a creatinine level of 7.7 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated at 0.31 ng/mL, indicating possible cardiac damage.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 1,796 mL over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 2,071 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's physical examination is unchanged from admission, except for mild tachycardia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and mild anemia may indicate cardiac damage or ongoing cardiac stress.
2. Renal complications: The patient's mildly impaired renal function may worsen if not closely monitored and managed.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly with the use of anticoagulant medications.
4. Infection complications: The patient's ongoing antibiotic therapy may be necessary to manage potential infections, particularly in the context of a thrombectomy.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance may be at risk of becoming imbalanced, particularly if the patient's output is not sufficient to match the input.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild tachypnea may be a sign of underlying respiratory distress or may be related to cardiac complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may be necessary to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan: 56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin
   autoantibody receptor syndrome, ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working
   HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension overnight
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn, metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs).  Last two FS low although had not eaten much, requesting
   breakfast this AM
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   - Trend electrolytes if possible (AG = 11 today)
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs
   .
   .
   # FEN: 50 cc/hr D5W, replete electrolytes (K only if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals (1 in foot currently)
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to
   intubate for reversible situation (e.g. PNA and fluid overload).
   Pressors ok.  Less certain about CPR/defibrillation.
   # Disposition:  observe in the peridialysis period, if hemodynamically
   stable then call out to floor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension overnight
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn, metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs).  Last two FS low although had not eaten much, requesting
   breakfast this AM
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   - Trend electrolytes if possible (AG = 11 today)
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and non-working hemodialysis (HD) graft. He underwent a graft revision and thrombectomy in the operating room (OR) on [**3-4**] and [**3-5**]. The patient has been non-compliant with insulin and has hyperglycemia. He also has a history of pneumonia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 94 bpm
* Blood pressure: 106/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* Creatinine: 7.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.31 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* HD using the revised graft
* Blood pressure monitoring and management
* ESRD management, including electrolyte monitoring and epoetin alfa therapy
* DKA management, including insulin therapy and glucose monitoring
* Pneumonia management, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and respiratory support
* Immunosuppression management, including prednisone therapy
* Hypothyroidism management, including levothyroxine therapy
* Capacity assessment, including psychological evaluation and legal consultation

Potential medical complications:

1. Graft failure: The patient's graft has been revised and thrombectomized twice, and it may still be at risk of failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of DKA and may be at risk of hyperglycemia due to non-compliance with insulin therapy.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had a brief episode of hypotension overnight and may be at risk of hypotension due to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of pneumonia and may be at risk of respiratory failure due to fluid overload and respiratory compromise.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of dCHF and may be at risk of cardiac arrest due to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
7. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy and may be at risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy.
8. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of thrombosis due to ESRD and may be at risk of thrombosis due to anticoagulation therapy and platelet dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs).  Last two FS low although had not eaten much, requesting
   breakfast this AM
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   - Trend electrolytes if possible (AG = 11 today)
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, no
   clear PNA on imaging.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient actually hypotensive overnight at last check,
   refused further checks after midnight.
   - Trend BP if pt will allow
   - Hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn for now
 will continue
   metoprolol according to holding parameters
   - Goal SBP > 100 for call out to floor
   .
   # Elevated trop: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes;
   no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is due to
   ESRD.
   - Trend CE, tele
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.
   - F/U legal recs
   - F/U further psych recs

   # FEN: 50 cc/hr D5W, replete electrolytes (K only if low), regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals (1 in foot currently)
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full - discussed at length with HCP. Pt has been DNR/DNI in
   the past but with recent discussions, uncertain of current feelings as
   he has been grateful for resuscitative efforts after the fact.  Ok to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-operative patient who underwent fistula revision and thrombectomy, and later, revision of an arteriovenous graft (AVG) due to a successful hemodialysis (HD) session. The patient remains uncooperative with vital signs, fluid management, and medication administration. They have a PIV (peripherally inserted intravenous) catheter in their foot, which is the only access currently available. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/59 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and low platelet count.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating a potential hypovolemic state, which may exacerbate their existing kidney dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which may be related to their surgical site or other sources.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase their risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the context of their recent surgery.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels may increase their risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or other complications.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid management is compromised due to their uncooperative behavior, which may lead to fluid overload and worsening of their respiratory status.
6. Catheter-related complications: The patient's PIV catheter in their foot may be at risk for complications such as infection, thrombosis, or dislodgment.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated respiratory rate and SpO2 levels may indicate early signs of respiratory failure, which may require prompt intervention.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust their fluid management accordingly.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed to prevent infection.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
4. Adjust the patient's glucose management plan to prevent further hyperglycemia.
5. Consider consulting a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of the patient's respiratory status.
6. Monitor the patient's PIV catheter for signs of complications and adjust their management plan accordingly.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a more stable unit or consulting a specialist for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62.7 kg, 70-inch tall male admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure. The patient underwent a fistula revision and thrombectomy in the operating room and received dialysis yesterday. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/75 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 97% and normal ABG results. The patient's neurologic status is unclear due to lack of assessment.

Lab results show:

* Renal function: Creatinine 7.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 29.1 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium 142 mmol/L, potassium 4.7 mmol/L, chloride 102 mmol/L
* Blood glucose: 259 mg/dL
* Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cell count 11.8 K/uL, hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL, platelet count 372 K/uL
* Coagulation studies: International normalized ratio (INR) 1.0, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 26.8 seconds
* Troponin-T: 0.31 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and DKA, which has been resolved. The patient is at risk for noncompliance due to challenges coping with his medical issues and intermittently refusing exams, labs, and finger stick glucose checks. The patient may also be at risk for pneumonia, but this is currently asymptomatic. The patient has difficulty with IV access and is currently receiving prophylactic antibiotics.

The plan is to continue ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and line management. The patient will be transferred to the floor once stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed  after OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   Underwent repeat procedure in OR [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately
   for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**]
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Continue home dose of metoprolol 50 TID with strict holding
   parameters
   - Continue to hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD [**3-4**] PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   -
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed with normoglycemia. Currently on home lantus and sliding scale.
   Episode of ASX hypoglycemia this AM.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs as well as home
   dose long acting insulin; consider reducing home dose of glargine due
   to recent hypoglycemia by d/c evening dose.
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   .
   # ? Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of
   enzymes; no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is
   due to ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a non-working hemodialysis (HD) graft.

The patient's current condition is stable, with normal vital signs, except for a brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**] which responded well to fluid bolus. He is currently normotensive and receiving metoprolol 50 TID with strict holding parameters.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 11.8
* Hct: 34.7
* Plt: 372
* Cr: 7.4
* TropT: 0.31
* TCO2: 26
* Glucose: 259
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR:11.6/26.8/1.0, Ca++:8.2 mg/dL, Mg++:1.8 mg/dL, PO4:3.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis and has a non-working graft.
* DKA: The patient had an episode of DKA and is currently normoglycemic.
* Pneumonia: The patient has coarse bilateral bronchial sounds and opacity in the right lower lobe on chest X-ray, but is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count.
* Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but have been flat at around 0.3 over multiple sets of enzymes, and no rise in CK-MB has been noted.

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol 50 TID
* Prednisone
* Levothyroxine
* Sevelamer
* Calcitriol
* PO iron
* Epo
* Zemplar
* Subcutaneous heparin

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypotension: The patient had a brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**] which responded well to fluid bolus.
* Pneumonia: The patient has coarse bilateral bronchial sounds and opacity in the right lower lobe on chest X-ray, and may require antibiotic therapy.
* Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and may indicate cardiac damage or ESRD.
* DKA: The patient had an episode of DKA and may require ongoing management of hyperglycemia.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and may require ongoing management with levothyroxine.
* Immunosuppression: The patient is on prednisone for insulin antibody production and may be at risk for immunosuppression.

The patient's disposition is uncertain, and further discussion with the healthcare team is needed to determine the best course of action."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**]
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Continue home dose of metoprolol 50 TID
   - Continue to hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed with normoglycemia. Currently on home lantus and sliding scale.
   Episode of ASX hypoglycemia this AM.
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   .
   # ? Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of
   enzymes; no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is
   due to ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot
   leave AMA. Will continue to work with family. Patient needs guardian.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 56-year-old man with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF), is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and non-working hemodialysis (HD) graft.

The patient had a brief episode of hypotension on the previous day, which responded well to fluid bolus. His blood pressure is currently normotensive. He is being treated with metoprolol 50 TID and other medications as per his home regimen.

The patient's ESRD is being managed with graft use for HD, and his electrolytes are being trended. He is receiving epo and Zemplar in HD, and sevelamer is being continued. Calcitriol and PO iron are being held.

The patient had an episode of asymptomatic hypoglycemia this morning, which was managed with sliding scale insulin. He is currently on home lantus and sliding scale insulin.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and his chest X-ray (CXR) shows opacity in the right lower lobe (RLL). Antibiotics were stopped yesterday due to the patient's afebrile state and normal white blood cell count. The patient's troponin levels have been elevated, but this is likely due to ESRD.

The patient is being treated with prednisone for insulin antibody production, and his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is being checked due to his reported fatigue.

The patient has been declared to lack capacity to leave against medical advice (AMA) and is currently under the care of a limited guardian. His legal and psychosocial situation requires further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and the use of metoprolol may increase the risk of further hypotension.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or sepsis.
3. DKA: The patient's DKA may recur, leading to further complications such as acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further complications such as uremia, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, leading to further complications such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and dry skin.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of infection, including pneumonia.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's dilated cardiomyopathy and history of DKA may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his blood pressure, electrolytes, and glucose levels. Further evaluation and management of his pneumonia, ESRD, and hypothyroidism are also necessary to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome,
   ESRD, PVD, dCHF p/w DKA and non-working HD graft.
   .
   # Nonworking graft: Presumed rethrombosed. Went to OR on [**3-4**] for graft
   thrombectomy and revision, was cleared from OR to use graft for HD.
   However, prior to HD graft went down. Underwent repeat procedure in OR
   [**3-5**]. Graft functioned appropriately for HD yesterday.
   - Appreciate surgery recs
   - Appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Blood pressure: Patient with brief episode of hypotension on [**2128-3-4**]
   but responded well to fluid bolus, currently normotensive
   - Follow blood pressure post HD
   - Continue home dose of metoprolol 50 TID
   - Continue to hold home minoxidil, dilt, doxazosyn
   .
   # ESRD:  Graft used successfully for HD yesterday PM post-revision.
   - Trend lytes if patient will agree to labs
   - Epo in HD
   - Zemplar in HD
   - Continue sevelamer
   - Hold calcitriol and PO iron
   - F/U renal recs
   .
   # DKA: Pt noncompliant with insulin; hyperglycemia may also have been
   precipitated by pneumonia or other infection. Gap initially 23, now
   closed to AG = 10 as of yesterday in the OR mid-afternoon (refused AM
   labs).  Last two FS low although had not eaten much, requesting
   breakfast this AM
   - Seen by [**Last Name (un) 276**] (appreciate recs)
   - Continue sliding scale per most recent [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs
   - Will discuss best home SS with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team as patient has been
   non-compliant in past and no revisions to scale in some time
   - Trend electrolytes if possible (AG = 11 today)
   .
   # Pneumonia: Given recent hospitalizations and HD pt, will cover
   broadly for HCAP. Pt is DM but does not have h/o pseudomonas infection
   and BP currently stable. Coarse BS on initial exam, refuses repeat exam
   this morning. Afebrile. Still no read on CXR from yesterday, today
   continued opacity in RLL. Abx stopped yesterday given afebrile, normal
   white count.
   - F/U final reads of CXR [**3-5**] and [**3-6**]
   - Consider resume Abx if febrile
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Has been flat at ~0.3 over multiple sets of
   enzymes; no rise in CK-MB noted. Therefore, likely elevated troponin is
   due to ESRD.
   - Trend CE, telemetry
   - Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
   .
   # Immunosuppression: On prednisone per med list (restarted yesterday)
   for insulin Ab production.
   - Continue prednisone for now
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
   - Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Capacity: Patient threatened earlier this admission to leave AMA. He
   has been declared to lack capacity to do so in the past given poor
   insight into his disease condition and lack of safe place to go. Son
   serves as limited guardian. Psych recs as above. Currently, pt cannot

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). He was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and non-working hemodialysis (HD) graft. The patient underwent graft thrombectomy and revision, but the graft failed again. He was treated with HD yesterday and is currently normotensive.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which are likely due to ESRD. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. His blood glucose levels are under control with sliding scale insulin.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% and no signs of respiratory distress. His cardiovascular status is also stable, with a regular heart rhythm and no murmurs or rubs.

The patient's medical complications include DKA, pneumonia, and elevated troponin levels. He is at risk for developing further complications, such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Metoprolol 50 TID
* Heparin sodium
* Sevelamer
* Calcitriol
* PO iron
* Prednisone
* Levothyroxine
* Aspirin (to be restarted once cleared by surgery)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue HD
* Monitor blood pressure and electrolyte levels
* Trend lytes if possible
* Continue sliding scale insulin
* F/U final reads of CXR
* Consider resume Abx if febrile
* Restart aspirin once cleared by surgery
* Continue prednisone for now
* Check TSH given c/o increased fatigue
* Continue levothyroxine
* F/U legal recs
* F/U further psych recs

The patient's disposition is to observe in the peridialysis period, and if hemodynamically stable, call out to the floor."

Summary:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, 62.7 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a review of systems unchanged from admission except for the addition of a fingerstick glucose reading of 46 this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and metoprolol for heart rate control. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 372. The patient's creatinine level is 7.4 mg/dL, and the troponin level is 0.31. The patient's blood glucose level is 259 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's fingerstick glucose reading of 46 this morning is a concern for hypoglycemia. The patient's blood glucose level is 259 mg/dL, which is above the normal range, but the patient's history of diabetes and the use of metoprolol may contribute to hypoglycemia.
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection. The patient's laboratory results show a high level of troponin, which may indicate myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is not provided, but the patient's weight remains stable at 62.7 kg, which may indicate fluid overload.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, which may indicate respiratory failure. The patient's ABG results are not provided, but the patient's respiratory support is not mentioned.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rate is 92 bpm, which is within the normal range, but the patient's history of cardiac disease and the use of metoprolol may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 178, which is below the normal range, which may indicate thrombocytopenia.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 7.4 mg/dL, which is above the normal range, which may indicate renal failure.

Overall, the patient's laboratory results and vital signs suggest that the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including hypoglycemia, infection, fluid overload, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure."

Summary:

The patient is a 62.7 kg male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure. He is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving treatment for his conditions. The patient has been refusing lab draws and finger sticks, making it challenging to monitor his condition. He has a history of methimazole allergy and has received antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support is minimal, with no mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination is normal, and his peripheral pulses are not assessed. His respiratory examination is normal, with clear breath sounds. His abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, and his skin is warm.

Laboratory results show that the patient has severe renal failure, with a creatinine level of 7.4 mg/dL. His blood glucose level is elevated, at 259 mg/dL. His complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, and his platelet count is 372 K/uL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of his renal failure and DKA. He is receiving insulin therapy and has had his gap closed. He is also being treated for noncompliance, which is affecting his medical care. The patient's IV access is difficult to obtain, and he is currently receiving care through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is severely elevated, indicating end-stage renal disease. If left untreated, this could lead to further deterioration in his kidney function.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and he has had a previous episode of DKA. If not managed properly, this could lead to further complications, such as coma or even death.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Noncompliance: The patient's refusal to participate in his medical care could lead to further complications, such as delayed diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions.
5. IV access difficulties: The patient's IV access is difficult to obtain, which could lead to delays in administering necessary medications and treatments."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62.7 kg male with a height of 70 inches, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure. The patient has a history of methimazole allergy and has been taking piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a normal sinus rhythm, and fluid balance is within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, with normal findings in the head, ears, nose, and throat, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. The patient's abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 372. The patient's creatinine level is 7.4 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is 0.31. The patient's glucose level is 259 mg/dL, and his lactic acid level is 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD): The patient's creatinine level is 7.4 mg/dL, indicating end-stage renal disease. The patient has a fistula and is refusing labs again today.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA has been resolved, and he is off insulin drip. The patient's glucose level is 259 mg/dL, and his gap has been closed.
3. Noncompliance: The patient is having challenges coping with his medical issues and is intermittently refusing exams, labs, and FSG checks. The patient is concerned with his competence in medical decision-making, and a psychologist has been involved.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with antibiotics and remains afebrile, with normal white blood cell counts.
5. IV access: The patient has had difficulty with IV access, with multiple attempts made to obtain access in the arms. The patient currently has a PIV in his foot and may be able to discontinue IV access.
6. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition plan is to continue with his current regimen.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is being monitored and adjusted as needed.
8. Lines: The patient has a 20-gauge line inserted on [**2128-3-5**] at 11:00 AM.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. Code status: The patient's code status is unknown.
11. Disposition: The patient's disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's intermittent refusal of exams, labs, and FSG checks may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of infections, which could worsen the patient's condition.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, but the patient's creatinine level is 7.4 mg/dL, indicating end-stage renal disease. Fluid overload could exacerbate the patient's renal failure.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 259 mg/dL, and his DKA has been resolved. However, the patient's glucose level is still elevated, and hyperglycemia could lead to further complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but the patient's pneumonia remains a concern, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
5. IV access complications: The patient's difficulty with IV access could lead to complications, such as infection or bleeding, if the patient is unable to receive necessary medications or fluids."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall, 62.7 kg male admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and renal failure. The patient has been refusing lab draws and finger sticks intermittently.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 116/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device used.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a well-nourished appearance, with no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and peripheral vascular examination is unable to assess due to the patient's refusal to cooperate.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.8, hemoglobin of 34.7, and platelet count of 372. The patient's creatinine level is 7.4, and troponin-T level is 0.31. The patient's glucose level has been fluctuating, with values ranging from 53 to 636 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD)
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), resolved
