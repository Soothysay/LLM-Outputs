   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient could be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent
   (perhaps less likely with Y-stent).
   - NPO overnight for bronchoscopy in AM
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   - Re-eval after bronchoscopy
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics Vancomycin for a likely short course of abx
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Creatinine at trending up from baseline of 2.1
   to 2.5 today
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath. The patient had a tracheal Y-stent placed and had a sudden-onset dyspnea, which was likely related to the collapse of the left lung or stent displacement. The patient was intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/49 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is receiving albuterol MDI and fluticasone 50mcg twice daily.

The patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no bands, which may be secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or underlying infection. The patient's creatinine is trending up from a baseline of 2.1 to 2.5 today, which may indicate chronic renal failure. The patient's hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, which may be related to chronic disease or renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is receiving mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's lung function deteriorates further.
2. Infection: The patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no bands, which may indicate an underlying infection. The patient is receiving antibiotics for a likely short course of treatment.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending up, which may indicate chronic renal failure. The patient's kidney function should be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications. The patient's bleeding risk should be closely monitored, especially with the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, which may be related to chronic disease or renal insufficiency. The patient's anemia should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for blood transfusions if necessary.
6. Microscopic hematuria: The patient has had similar findings on multiple prior urinalyses, which may be related to placement of the Foley catheter or underlying bladder pathology. The patient's microscopic hematuria should be closely monitored to rule out underlying bladder pathology."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent.
   .
   Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient could be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent
   (perhaps less likely with Y-stent).
   - NPO overnight for bronchoscopy in AM
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   .
   Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - Trend CXR
   - No clear indication for antibiotics at this time
   .
   Chronic renal failure: Creatinine at trending up from baseline of 2.1
   to 2.5 today
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.
   .
   Diabetes Mellitus Type II: stable
   - Continue home regimen of Glargine 18 units AM and humalog insulin
   .
   CAD: denies curreny chest pain. EKG at baseline. continue home meds
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Metoprolol tartrate 50mg twice daily
   - Simvastatin 80mg daily
   .
   HTN: Well-controlled.
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Lasix 40mg daily
   .
   Asthma: as above
   - Continue fluticasone, singulair, mucomyst and albuterol nebs prn
   - Hold fexofenadine during this admission (loratadine not formulary)
   .
   Insomnia:
   - Will start with home trazodone
   - Consider Ativan if pt unable to sleep (per his request)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, DMII, and HTN, who presented with acute shortness of breath and was intubated. The patient has a tracheal Y-stent with external fixation, and the dyspnea is likely due to stent migration, infection, aspiration, or pulmonary edema. The patient has been stabilized, and the stent displacement was corrected. The patient is currently intubated and receiving respiratory support. The patient has mild leukocytosis, and the WBC count is trending upwards. The creatinine level is increasing, and the patient is at risk for chronic renal failure. The patient has anemia, and the Hct level is above baseline. The patient has microscopic hematuria, which may be related to the placement of the Foley catheter or underlying bladder pathology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to the presence of a tracheal Y-stent and the possibility of stent migration or displacement.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to the presence of a tracheal Y-stent and the possibility of aspiration.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient is at risk for acute kidney injury due to the increasing creatinine level and the presence of chronic renal failure.
4. Anemia: The patient is at risk for anemia due to the presence of chronic disease and renal insufficiency.
5. Microscopic hematuria: The patient is at risk for microscopic hematuria due to the presence of underlying bladder pathology or the placement of the Foley catheter.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of a tracheal Y-stent and the possibility of stent migration or displacement.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications due to the presence of CAD and the possibility of stent migration or displacement.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the respiratory support as necessary.
2. Trend the WBC count and temperature curve to monitor for signs of infection.
3. Trend the creatinine level and adjust the medications as necessary to avoid nephrotoxins.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust the medications as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's microscopic hematuria and adjust the medications as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust the antibiotics as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust the medications as necessary."

Summary:

The patient, a 72-inch tall individual, is admitted to the ICU with acute collapse of the left lung, respiratory distress, and suspected stent migration. The patient's condition has improved over the past 24 hours, with reduced secretions and improved oxygen saturation. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and antibiotics. The patient has a history of diabetes, chronic renal failure, anemia, coronary artery disease, and asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Stent migration: The patient's left lung collapse may be due to stent migration, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumothorax or hemothorax.
2. Mucous plugging: The patient's secretions may be causing mucous plugging, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
4. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as electrolyte imbalances or uremic symptoms.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to chronic renal failure or acute bleeding, and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as fatigue or shortness of breath.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's coronary artery disease may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
9. Infection: The patient's antibiotic treatment may not be effective against the underlying infection, leading to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU due to acute collapse of the left lung, respiratory distress, and suspected stent migration. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 7 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with symmetric lung expansion and clear breath sounds. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, and the peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable except for the absence of radial pulses on both sides. The patient's abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. The patient's skin is warm, and the neurologic examination is normal except for the absence of assessment of movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, and the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type I. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, and the patient is receiving vancomycin intravenously for a suspected coagulase-positive staphylococcal infection.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Resolution of left lung collapse, likely due to mucous plugging or stent migration
* Stent migration and assessment in the operating room today
* Leukocytosis with no fever, but with an increase in secretions, and treatment with vancomycin intravenously
* Diabetes mellitus type I, with a plan to manage blood sugar levels
* Remainder of plan per resident note

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to stent migration or mucous plugging
* Sepsis due to coagulase-positive staphylococcal infection
* Worsening of diabetes mellitus type I due to inadequate blood sugar control
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility
* Stress ulcer bleeding due to mechanical ventilation
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent, now s/p stent removal by IP
   on [**4-13**].
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient may be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent.
   Rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed stent migration, and the stent was
   removed; necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided.
   - Plan to return to OR for repeat bronch and possible stent placement
   (will confirm timing with IR)
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
 currently off ventilator
   on trach mask, doing well
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics (Vancomycin 1000 mg Q48h, day 1 = [**4-13**]) for a likely short
   course of abx
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u culture data (urine finalized without growth; blood cx prelim
   NGTD)
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Creatinine trending up from baseline of 2.1 to
   2.5 yesterday, now 2.2
   - Trend Cr
   - Urine lytes with Na 56, FeNa 1.69%
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type II: stable; though FSG today in mid-to-upper
   200s
   - Continue home regimen of Glargine 18 units AM and humalog insulin;
   consider increasing to Glargine 20
   .
   # CAD: denies curreny chest pain. EKG at baseline. continue home meds
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Metoprolol tartrate 50mg twice daily
   - Simvastatin 80mg daily
   .
   # HTN: Well-controlled.
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Lasix 40mg daily
   .
   # Asthma: as above
   - Continue fluticasone, singulair, and albuterol nebs prn; hold
   mucomyst for now as above
   - Hold fexofenadine during this admission (loratadine not formulary)
   .
   # Insomnia:
   - Will start with home trazodone
   - Consider Ativan if pt unable to sleep (per his request)
   .
   FEN: Clear liquids for now, will ADAT (pending IP recs for no further
   procedure today), replete electrolytes prn, IVF boluses prn until
   taking in more fluids by mouth

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent, now s/p stent removal by IP
   on [**4-13**].
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient may be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent.
   Rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed stent migration, and the stent was
   removed; necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided.
   - Plan to return to OR for repeat bronch and possible stent placement
   (will confirm timing with IR)
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
 currently off ventilator
   on trach mask, doing well
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics (Vancomycin 1000 mg Q48h, day 1 = [**4-13**]) for a likely short
   course of abx
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u culture data (urine finalized without growth; blood cx prelim
   NGTD)
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Creatinine trending up from baseline of 2.1 to
   2.5 yesterday, now 2.2
   - Trend Cr
   - Urine lytes with Na 56, FeNa 1.69%
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type II: stable; though FSG today in mid-to-upper
   200s
   - Continue home regimen of Glargine 18 units AM and humalog insulin;
   consider increasing to Glargine 20
   .
   # CAD: denies curreny chest pain. EKG at baseline. continue home meds
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Metoprolol tartrate 50mg twice daily
   - Simvastatin 80mg daily
   .
   # HTN: Well-controlled.
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily
   - Lasix 40mg daily

   # Asthma: as above
   - Continue fluticasone, singulair, and albuterol nebs prn; hold
   mucomyst for now as above
   - Hold fexofenadine during this admission (loratadine not formulary)

   # Insomnia:
   - Will start with home trazodone
   - Consider Ativan if pt unable to sleep (per his request)

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, DMII, and HTN, who presented with acute shortness of breath and was found to have a tracheal Y stent with external fixation. The patient underwent stent removal in the operating room and was intubated.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is currently intubated and on a tracheostomy tube, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's airways are patent, but there is some necrotic tissue obstructing the airway above the endotracheal tube insertion site.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of CAD and is s/p CABG, with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no overt evidence of CHF.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 125/49 mmHg, with a heart rate of 55 beats per minute.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,190 mL of fluids, with a net balance of -1,090 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.6, with a mild leukocytosis and elevated PMNs. The patient's creatinine is trending up from a baseline of 2.1 to 2.5, with a current level of 2.2.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the presence of necrotic tissue in the airway.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is s/p CABG, which may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending up, which may indicate renal failure or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
* Infection: The patient has a history of stent migration and removal, which may increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including a bleeding diathesis, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications during the patient's hospital stay.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring respiratory status while intubated
* Continuing antibiotics for a likely short course
* Trending WBC count and temperature
* Monitoring creatinine and urine electrolytes
* Renally dosing medications and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Continuing home regimen of insulin and other medications
* Holding certain medications, such as Tussin and Mucomyst, to minimize risk of bronchospasm
* Considering Ativan for insomnia if necessary
* Providing clear liquids for now, with plans to advance diet as tolerated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient could be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent
   (perhaps less likely with Y-stent).
   - NPO overnight for bronchoscopy in AM
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   - Re-eval after bronchoscopy
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics Vancomycin for a likely short course of abx

   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend

   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, and tracheal Y-stent with external fixation, who presented with acute shortness of breath. The patient has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of CAD and is s/p CABG, but last echo shows normal LVEF and no overt evidence of CHF. The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or underlying infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored, and the patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. However, there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's lung function does not improve.
2. Infection: The patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs, which may indicate an underlying infection. The patient is currently afebrile, but the risk of infection is still present.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is trending up from baseline, which may indicate worsening chronic renal failure. The patient's medications will be renally dosed, and nephrotoxins will be avoided.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is above baseline, which may indicate hemoconcentration. The patient's anemia is likely secondary to chronic disease and renal insufficiency.
5. Microscopic hematuria: The patient has had similar findings on multiple prior U/A's, which may indicate an underlying bladder pathology. The patient's CK level is normal, and coags are normal.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes is stable, and the patient is continuing home regimen of Glargine and Humalog insulin.
7. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is s/p CABG, but last echo shows normal LVEF and no overt evidence of CHF. The patient is continuing home medications for CAD.
8. HTN: The patient's HTN is well-controlled, and the patient is continuing home medications.
9. Asthma: The patient has asthma, and the patient is continuing fluticasone, Singulair, Mucomyst, and albuterol nebs prn.
10. Insomnia: The patient has insomnia, and the patient will start with home trazodone and consider Ativan if the patient is unable to sleep.

The patient's condition is closely monitored, and the patient is receiving treatment for the underlying conditions. The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is admitted to the ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent, now s/p stent removal by IP
   on [**4-13**].
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient may be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent.
   Rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed stent migration, and the stent was
   removed; necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided.
   - Plan to return to OR for repeat bronch and possible stent placement,
   ?tomorrow
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics (Vancomycin 1000 mg Q48h, day 1 = [**4-13**]) for a likely short
   course of abx
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u culture data (urine finalized without growth; blood cx prelim
   NGTD)
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Creatinine trending up from baseline of 2.1 to
   2.5 yesterday, now 2.2
   - Trend Cr
   - Urine lytes with Na 56, FeNa 1.69%
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type II: stable; though FSG today in mid-to-upper
   200s
   - Continue home regimen of Glargine 18 units AM and humalog insulin;
   consider increasing to Glargine 20?
   .
   # CAD: denies curreny chest pain. EKG at baseline. continue home meds
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of CAD, CABG, DMII, and HTN, who presented with acute shortness of breath and was intubated. The patient underwent stent removal and debridement of necrotic tissue in the trachea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/49 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a diagnosis of tracheal Y stent migration and possible stent occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The chest X-ray shows clear lungs, but there is a possible left-sided effusion or partial collapse.

The patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs, possibly secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or underlying infection. The patient is currently afebrile, and the sputum culture shows moderate growth of Staph aureus.

The patient has chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level trending up from baseline. The patient's anemia is likely secondary to chronic disease and renal insufficiency. The patient has had microscopic hematuria on multiple prior urine analyses, which could relate to placement of the Foley catheter or underlying bladder pathology.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is stable, but the fasting glucose level today is in the mid-to-upper 200s. The patient's CAD is well-controlled, and the patient's HTN is well-controlled.

The patient's asthma is being managed with fluticasone, singulair, and albuterol nebs prn. The patient's insomnia is being treated with trazodone, and the patient is being advised to take Ativan if unable to sleep.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to stent migration and possible stent occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus.
2. Sepsis: The patient has mild leukocytosis and elevated PMNs, which could indicate an underlying infection.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine level is trending up from baseline, and there is a risk of chronic kidney disease progression.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to chronic disease and renal insufficiency, and there is a risk of worsening anemia.
5. Hematuria: The patient has had microscopic hematuria on multiple prior urine analyses, which could relate to placement of the Foley catheter or underlying bladder pathology.
6. Insomnia: The patient's insomnia is being treated with trazodone, and there is a risk of worsening insomnia.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Monitor respiratory status while intubated.
2. Trend WBC count and temperature curve.
3. Cover with antibiotics for a likely short course of therapy.
4. Trend CXR.
5. Follow-up culture data.
6. Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
7. Continue home regimen of Glargine and humalog insulin.
8. Consider increasing Glargine to 20 units.
9. Continue home medications for CAD and HTN.
10. Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm.
11. Start with home trazodone for insomnia, and consider Ativan if unable to sleep."

   [From op note: stent was found distal to the endotracheal tube
   at the carina with the button inside the stent, rigid bronchoscope was
   used as well as the forceps to remove the stent. Then the flexible
   bronchoscope was used for inspection and the airways were patent except
   there was necrotic tissue obstructing the airway above the endotracheal
   tube insertion site. The barrel was used to core out and debride some
   of the necrotic tissue and the forceps was used to remove it.]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 OR SENT - At [**2155-4-13**] 10:15 AM
   - to OR with IP and underwent stent removal; large amount of
   inflammation/necrotic tissue from button hole that eroded through
   trachea.  #7 tracheostomy tube placed.  Plan is to take patient back to
   OR in about 2 days for repeat bronch and possible stent placement.
   [From op note: stent was found distal to the endotracheal tube
   at the carina with the button inside the stent, rigid bronchoscope was
   used as well as the forceps to remove the stent. Then the flexible
   bronchoscope was used for inspection and the airways were patent except
   there was necrotic tissue obstructing the airway above the endotracheal
   tube insertion site. The barrel was used to core out and debride some
   of the necrotic tissue and the forceps was used to remove it.]

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o M with history of CAD, CABG, DMII, HTN, with tracheal Y stent
   with external fixation presenting with acute shortness of breath,
   likely mechanical from shifting of stent, now s/p stent removal by IP
   on [**4-13**].
   .
   # Dyspnea/stridor: Initial dyspnea in this patient may be
   multifactorial, with contributions from stent migration (patient has
   had similar complications in the past), infection/PNA, aspiration, or
   pulmonary edema. The sudden-onset dyspnea that the patient experienced
   most likely relates to the collapse of the left lung seen on imaging
   from the OSH. This event may also have been related to stent
   displacement occluding the left mainstem bronchus or to mucous
   plugging, bronchomalacia, or other mechanical event. This problem seems
   to have been corrected following intubation, as CXR here shows
   generally clear lungs although there appears to be a L-sided effusion
   or ? partial collapse obscuring the left heart border. Patient has a
   history of CAD and is s/p CABG, although last echo shows normal LVEF
   and no overt evidence of CHF. Stridor suggests upper airway
   constriction, which could be related to underlying
   stenosis/post-surgical changes or to upward migration of the stent.
   Rigid bronchoscopy on [**4-13**] showed stent migration, and the stent was
   removed; necrotic tissue at the buttonhole was debrided.
   - Plan to return to OR for repeat bronch and possible stent placement,
   ?tomorrow
   - Monitor respiratory status while intubated
   - Albuterol MDI (instead of nebs, given intubated) standing TID
   - Fluticasone 50mcg 2 sprays each nostril twice daily
   - Gabapentin 100mg three times daily
   - Singlulair 10mg daily
   - Hold Tussin for now as patient may need strong cough to clear
   secretions
   - Hold Mucomyst nebs for now to minimize risk of bronchospasm
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has mild leukocytosis with elevated PMNs but no
   bands. This is possibly secondary to inflammation induced by ? stent
   displacement vs. underlying infection (pulmonary source most likely).
   Patient is currently afebrile.
   - Trend WBC count, temp curve
   - sputum with coag + staph and increased secretions, will cover with
   antibiotics (Vancomycin 1000 mg Q48h, day 1 = [**4-13**]) for a likely short
   course of abx
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u culture data (urine finalized without growth; blood cx prelim
   NGTD)
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Creatinine trending up from baseline of 2.1 to
   2.5 yesterday, now 2.2
   - Trend Cr
   - Urine lytes with Na 56, FeNa 1.69%
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease/renal insufficiency.
   Patient takes Procrit injections as outpatient. Hct currently above
   baseline of 27-30, which may indicate hemoconcentration.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # Microscopic hematuria: Patient has had similar findings on multiple
   prior U/A's. Could relate to placement of Foley (traumatic) but cannot
   exclude underlying bladder pathology. Review shows large blood but
   minimal RBCs, ?hemo/myoglobinuria. CK normal and normal coags.
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus Type II: stable; though FSG today in mid-to-upper
   200s
   - Continue home regimen of Glargine 18 units AM and humalog insulin;
   consider increasing to Glargine 20?
   .
   # CAD: denies curreny chest pain. EKG at baseline. continue home meds
   - Amlodipine 10mg daily

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and asthma, who was admitted to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and stridor.

The patient underwent stent removal in the operating room and was found to have large amounts of inflammation and necrotic tissue from the button hole that eroded through the trachea. A tracheostomy tube was placed, and the patient is currently intubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 55 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis with elevated polymorphonuclear cells, but no bands, which may be secondary to inflammation induced by stent displacement or underlying infection. The patient's creatinine level is trending up from baseline, and he has chronic renal failure. The patient's hemoglobin level is above the normal range, which may indicate hemoconcentration.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic disease, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. He is taking several medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and simvastatin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to the stent displacement and the presence of inflammation and necrotic tissue in the trachea.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus, which may indicate a pulmonary infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and polymorphonuclear cells may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is trending up from baseline, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is normal, but he is at risk of bleeding complications due to the presence of inflammation and necrotic tissue in the trachea.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and hypertension makes him at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of respiratory status while intubated.
2. Administration of antibiotics to cover a likely short course of treatment.
3. Trending of WBC count, temperature, and CXR.
4. Renal dose adjustment of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
5. Continuous monitoring of electrolyte levels and repletion as needed.
6. Consideration of repeat bronchoscopy and possible stent placement.
7. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular status and adjustment of medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and hypertension. He presented to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory distress due to stent migration, which was removed yesterday. The patient is currently breathing comfortably on a tracheostomy collar and is receiving oxygen therapy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 136/52 mmHg. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and blood pressure medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress could worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a history of stent migration, which could increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but his chronic renal failure could worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has a history of diabetes. If not properly managed, he could develop diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, but he is at risk of developing DVT due to his immobility and medical history.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcer bleeding due to his respiratory distress, chronic renal failure, and anticoagulant therapy.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases his risk of developing VAP.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."
