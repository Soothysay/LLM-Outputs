   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia (reduced intake, possible
   blood loss) and sepsis.  Improved.  monitor BP, maintain MAP >60.
   SEPSIS -- low grade temp.  Concern for line related infection
 now
   with GPC from blood culture obtained at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  Empirical
   Daptomycin, Levofloxicin.  Await culture results.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to change
   line, esp. if cultures remain positive.
   ANEMIA -- decrease in setting of recent renal bx, iv fluid
   resussitation.  Monitor serial Hct.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- prerenal failure in background of renal
   insufficiency.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> improved.  Continue repletion to maintain BP,
   P and urine output.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- stable dose of flolan.  continue.
   HIT + -- avoid heparin products.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following conditions and potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, including the brain, kidneys, and liver. This can cause organ dysfunction, failure, or even death.

Potential complications: Organ dysfunction, failure, or death.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a low-grade temperature and is at risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, failure, or death.

Potential complications: Multi-organ dysfunction, failure, or death.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, causing fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.

Potential complications: Fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased cognitive function.

4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and acidosis.

Potential complications: Fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, acidosis.

5. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary artery pressure is elevated, which can lead to right heart failure, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.

Potential complications: Right heart failure, pulmonary edema, decreased cardiac output.

6. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT+): The patient has been exposed to heparin, which can cause a decrease in platelet count, leading to bleeding and increased risk of thrombotic complications.

Potential complications: Bleeding, thrombotic complications.

7. Line-Related Infection: The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath) and a 20-gauge line, which can increase the risk of line-related infection, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.

Potential complications: Line-related infection, sepsis, organ dysfunction.

8. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is compromised, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and increased risk of complications.

Potential complications: Fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, increased risk of complications.

9. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nutritional support is compromised, which can lead to malnutrition, gastrointestinal bleeding, and decreased immune function.

Potential complications: Malnutrition, gastrointestinal bleeding, decreased immune function.

10. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support is compromised, which can lead to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and decreased oxygenation.

Potential complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia, decreased oxygenation.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of acute distress or organ dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, renal insufficiency, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving empirical antibiotics for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's low-grade temperature and concern for line-related infection suggest that sepsis may be a complication.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly treated, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to vital organs.
3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's prerenal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's stable dose of flolan may not be sufficient to manage their pulmonary hypertension, leading to worsening respiratory status.
5. HIT: The patient's heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) may worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding or thrombotic complications.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac failure or respiratory distress.
7. Infection: The patient's indwelling port and central lines may increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's stable oxygen saturation may not be sufficient to meet their oxygen demands, leading to respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Optimize the patient's fluid management to prevent fluid overload and promote optimal renal function.
3. Manage the patient's sepsis and anemia aggressively to prevent worsening organ dysfunction.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen based on the results of their blood cultures.
5. Monitor the patient's pulmonary hypertension and adjust their flolan dose as needed to maintain optimal respiratory function.
6. Avoid heparin and consider alternative anticoagulation therapies to manage the patient's HIT.
7. Consider removing the patient's indwelling port and central lines to reduce the risk of infection.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history and multiple comorbidities. The patient's current condition is marked by:

1. Fever (hypothermia) with a Tmax of 36.7°C (98°F) and a current temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F).
2. Hypotension, with a blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg (90/49 mmHg) and a mean arterial pressure of 94 mmHg.
3. Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen delivery and an SpO2 of 97%.
4. Abnormal laboratory results, including:
	* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a count of 2.4 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L).
	* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI).
	* Elevated troponin-T level, indicating possible cardiac injury.
	* Elevated lactate acid level, indicating possible tissue hypoxia.
5. Presence of central venous catheters (CVCs) and arterial lines, which may increase the risk of line infections.
6. Presence of a tunneled Hickman line, which may increase the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
7. Presence of a 20-gauge arterial line, which may increase the risk of arterial line complications.
8. Presence of pulmonary hypertension, which may increase the risk of right ventricular failure and cardiovascular complications.
9. Presence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may increase the risk of bleeding complications and other systemic manifestations.
10. Presence of acute renal failure (ARF), which may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and other complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the presence of central lines, arterial lines, and possible line infections.
2. Cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock, due to the presence of pulmonary hypertension and possible cardiac injury.
3. Respiratory failure, due to the presence of pulmonary hypertension and possible right ventricular failure.
4. Renal failure, due to the presence of AKI and possible progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
5. Bleeding complications, due to the presence of SLE and possible coagulopathy.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and other metabolic complications, due to the presence of AKI and possible electrolyte wasting.
7. Infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), arterial line infections, and possible pulmonary infections, due to the presence of central lines, arterial lines, and possible line infections.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and initiate prompt interventions to prevent or manage them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with lupus and pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension refractory to IV fluid resuscitation. She has a history of kidney biopsy and recent discharge from the hospital. The patient's current condition is stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 4L of oxygen. Her lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia and is currently receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of line sepsis due to the presence of central lines and the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension and is currently receiving Flolan. There is a risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension due to the patient's underlying condition and the medication.
3. Leukopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which may increase the risk of infections.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Kidney disease: The patient has a history of kidney biopsy and is currently experiencing worsening proteinuria. There is a risk of further kidney damage due to the patient's underlying condition and the medication.
6. Diabetes: The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently receiving insulin. There is a risk of hypoglycemia due to the medication and the patient's underlying condition.
7. Migraines: The patient has a history of migraines and is currently receiving amitriptyline. There is a risk of worsening migraines due to the patient's underlying condition and the medication.
8. Depression and anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety and is currently receiving antidepressant medication. There is a risk of worsening depression and anxiety due to the patient's underlying condition and the medication.
9. Fungal pneumonia: The patient has a history of fungal pneumonia and is currently receiving antifungal medication. There is a risk of worsening fungal pneumonia due to the patient's underlying condition and the medication.
10. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is currently receiving anticoagulant medication. There is a risk of worsening deep vein thrombosis due to the patient's underlying condition and the medication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with lupus, pulmonary hypertension, and kidney disease, who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension refractory to IV fluid resuscitation. She has a history of kidney biopsy and recent discharge from the hospital. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg. She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressants. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line sepsis: Given the patient's recent discharge from the hospital and the presence of GPCs, there is a risk of line sepsis.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension is stable, but there is a risk of worsening if not properly managed.
3. Lupus nephritis: The patient's lupus nephritis is worsening, with a protein/creatinine ratio of 8, and there is a risk of further kidney damage if not properly managed.
4. Diabetes: The patient is holding oral hypoglycemics and is on insulin sliding scale, but there is a risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if not properly managed.
5. Depression and anxiety: The patient is taking antidepressants, but there is a risk of worsening depression and anxiety if not properly managed.
6. Migraines: The patient is taking amitriptyline for migraines, but there is a risk of worsening migraines if not properly managed.
7. Fungal peritonitis: The patient has a history of presumed fungal peritonitis, and there is a risk of further complications if not properly managed.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis, and there is a risk of further complications if not properly managed.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing a stress ulcer due to her critical illness.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation."

Summary:

The patient is a 66-inch tall individual with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and unknown allergies to penicillins, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides. They were admitted to the ICU with a fever, and their vital signs are currently stable. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, and their oxygen saturation is 97%. Their heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their blood pressure is within normal limits. They are receiving IV fluids and have a central line inserted.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating possible inflammation and organ damage. Their creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. Their troponin-T level is slightly elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of septic shock, especially with their history of unknown allergies.
2. Line infection: The presence of a central line increases the risk of line infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute kidney injury, which could progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Cardiac damage: The slightly elevated troponin-T level suggests possible cardiac damage, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: The patient's PHTN could exacerbate with their current condition, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac complications.
6. Systemic lupus erythematosus exacerbation: The patient's SLE could exacerbate with their current condition, leading to skin rashes, joint pain, or other systemic symptoms.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury could progress to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and overall condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 51 yo female with lupus and pulm HTN now s/p kidney biopsy and
   recent discharge for right cardiac cath who is presenting with
   hypotension refractory to IVF resuscitation at OSH.
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension concerning for SIRS/sepsis or bleed given
   recent procedure, renal biopsy. Other possible etiologies include
   adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroid use and recent procedure,
   medication effect since recently started on Lisinopril, or medication
   effect from Flolan, possible dysfunction although no recent change in
   dose or reported problems. [**Name (NI) 1816**] likely SIRS/sepsis given fever, low
   WBC. Most likely etiology is line infection given tunneled Hickmans x 1
   year, h/o similar episodes in past and c/o tenderness. In past, pt has
   grown Micrococcus from line and blood cx. Due to interactions with
   Linezolid and Amitriptyline (which pt refuses to stop taking) she has
   been treated with Dapto in past as well as levoflox for gram neg
   coverage. Also consider pneumonia, UTI, although no other localizing
   symptoms. Cardiogenic shock less likely cause of hypotension given lack
   of cardiac symptoms and other signs of infection including fever. Here,
   BP has been responsive to IVF with current SBPs high 90s to 100s.
   - IVF NS at 150cc/hour. Has received 4 liters NS at OSH. Appears
   slightly dry on exam with dry mucus menbranes but pulmonary exam with
   crackles, concern for fluid overload. WIll follow mental status, UOP to
   assess need for IVF resuscitation and continue continuous IVF
   - Daptomycin and Levofloxacin for now for empiric coverage
   - Serial lactate to assess hypoperfusion
   - repeat HCT to assess possible bleed, transfuse PRBC to maintain
   HCT>21 or signs active bleed, check coags
   - Will need to assess need to change line given possible line infection
   - UA, urine cx
   - Follow up blood cx from OSH and repeat blood cx x 2 here
   - Consult ID in am given multiple allergies h/o Micrococcus bacteremia,
   ? appropriate ABx use and duration
   - Renal Ultrasound to assess for hematoma/abscess/fluid collection
   after procedure
   - CEs to ROMI. ECG without acute changes
   - Hold Lisinoprol, home Lasix for now
   - If BP remains low will consider stress dose steroids
   .
   #Fever: Most likely [**2-21**] infection as above but also could have
   inflammatory component given worsening lupus recently, low grade fevers
   x 6months.
   - Fever workup and treat infection as above
   .
   #Pulmonary hypertension: Recent cardiac cath demonstrated severe pulm
   HTN despite Flolan.
   - Continue Flolan
   - Will readd Lasix as BP tolerates, holding for now
   - Off Coumadin until Saturday, will assess for bleed, HCT drop
   - Continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats >93%
   - Consider addition second [**Doctor Last Name **] as per primary pulmonologist but hold
   for now  given hypotension
   .
   # Lupus nephritis: Patient has lupus nephritis with recent worsening of
   proteinuria, most recently Protein/creatinine ratio 8, improved from
   15-16 [**9-27**].
   - Follow renal function (no labs in system yet today)
   .
   # DM: holding oral hypoglycemics, on ISS
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: Pt on multiple meds at home. Concern for
   serotonin syndrome given multiple medications and received Linezolid.
   Was going to continue Linezolid but contraindicated with Amitriptyline
   and pt refuses to stop amitriptyline. Per pharmacy, should not
   administer both medications. Linezolid changed to Dapto as per prior
   admission.
   - Continued Cymbalta, amitriptyline, holding Wellbutrin
   .
   #Migraines: Continuing Amitrityline
   .
   # FEN: NPO for renal US
   .
   # PPX: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis (Questionable h/o HIT) ?why pt
   is on fluconazole will continue for now for presumed fungal PPX, bowel

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 51 yo female with lupus and pulm HTN now s/p kidney biopsy and
   recent discharge for right cardiac cath who is presenting with
   hypotension refractory to IVF resuscitation at OSH.
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension concerning for SIRS/sepsis or bleed given
   recent procedure, renal biopsy. Other possible etiologies include
   adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroid use and recent procedure,
   medication effect since recently started on Lisinopril, or medication
   effect from Flolan, possible dysfunction although no recent change in
   dose or reported problems. [**Name (NI) 1816**] likely SIRS/sepsis given fever, low
   WBC. Most likely etiology is line infection given tunneled Hickmans x 1
   year, h/o similar episodes in past and c/o tenderness. In past, pt has
   grown Micrococcus from line and blood cx. Due to interactions with
   Linezolid and Amitriptyline (which pt refuses to stop taking) she has
   been treated with Dapto in past as well as levoflox for gram neg
   coverage. Also consider pneumonia, UTI, although no other localizing
   symptoms. Cardiogenic shock less likely cause of hypotension given lack
   of cardiac symptoms and other signs of infection including fever. Here,
   BP has been responsive to IVF with current SBPs high 90s to 100s.
   - IVF NS at 150cc/hour. Has received 4 liters NS at OSH. Appears
   slightly dry on exam with dry mucus menbranes but pulmonary exam with
   crackles, concern for fluid overload. WIll follow mental status, UOP to
   assess need for IVF resuscitation and continue continuous IVF
   - Daptomycin and Levofloxacin for now for empiric coverage
   - Serial lactate to assess hypoperfusion
   - repeat HCT to assess possible bleed, transfuse PRBC to maintain
   HCT>21 or signs active bleed, check coags
   - Will need to assess need to change line given possible line infection
   - UA, urine cx
   - Follow up blood cx from OSH and repeat blood cx x 2 here
   - Consult ID in am given multiple allergies h/o Micrococcus bacteremia,
   ? appropriate ABx use and duration
   - Renal Ultrasound to assess for hematoma/abscess/fluid collection
   after procedure
   - CEs to ROMI. ECG without acute changes
   - Hold Lisinoprol, home Lasix for now
   - If BP remains low will consider stress dose steroids
   .
   #Fever: Most likely [**2-21**] infection as above but also could have
   inflammatory component given worsening lupus recently, low grade fevers
   x 6months.
   - Fever workup and treat infection as above
   .
   #Pulmonary hypertension: Recent cardiac cath demonstrated severe pulm
   HTN despite Flolan.
   - Continue Flolan
   - Will readd Lasix as BP tolerates, holding for now
   - Off Coumadin until Saturday, will assess for bleed, HCT drop
   - Continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats >93%
   - Consider addition second [**Doctor Last Name **] as per primary pulmonologist but hold
   for now  given hypotension
   .
   # Lupus nephritis: Patient has lupus nephritis with recent worsening of
   proteinuria, most recently Protein/creatinine ratio 8, improved from
   15-16 [**9-27**].
   - Follow renal function (no labs in system yet today)
   .
   # DM: holding oral hypoglycemics, on ISS
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: Pt on multiple meds at home. Concern for
   serotonin syndrome given multiple medications and received Linezolid.
   Was going to continue Linezolid but contraindicated with Amitriptyline
   and pt refuses to stop amitriptyline. Per pharmacy, should not
   administer both medications. Linezolid changed to Dapto as per prior
   admission.
   - Continued Cymbalta, amitriptyline, holding Wellbutrin
   .
   #Migraines: Continuing Amitrityline
   .
   # FEN: NPO for renal US
   .
   # PPX: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis (Questionable h/o HIT) ?why pt
   is on fluconazole will continue for now for presumed fungal PPX, bowel
   regimen

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with lupus, pulmonary hypertension, and kidney disease who was recently discharged from the hospital after a right cardiac catheterization and kidney biopsy. She was admitted to the ICU due to refractory hypotension, fever, and possible line infection. She has a history of similar episodes and has grown Micrococcus from her line and blood cultures in the past. She is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors to manage her hypotension. She also has a history of depression, anxiety, and migraines, and is taking multiple medications at home.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of line infections and recent procedure, sepsis is a possible complication.
2. Line infection: The patient's tunneled Hickman line is a potential source of infection, and further evaluation and treatment are needed.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of bleeding complications make bleeding a possible complication.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid use and recent procedure make adrenal insufficiency a possible complication.
5. Medication interactions: The patient's multiple medications and allergies make medication interactions a possible complication.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and pulmonary exam findings make pneumonia a possible complication.
7. UTI: The patient's history of UTIs and current symptoms make UTI a possible complication.
8. Fluid overload: The patient's pulmonary exam findings and current fluid status make fluid overload a possible complication.
9. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and lack of cardiac symptoms make cardiogenic shock a possible complication.
10. Renal dysfunction: The patient's kidney disease and recent kidney biopsy make renal dysfunction a possible complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids and vasopressors to manage the patient's hypotension.
2. Perform a repeat blood culture and consider sending the blood culture to the lab for further evaluation.
3. Consider changing the patient's line if the culture results are positive.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if the count drops below 10,000.
5. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as needed to manage the patient's infection.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider sending the patient for a renal ultrasound to evaluate for potential complications.
7. Consider stress dose steroids if the patient's hypotension persists.
8. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider consulting psychiatry if the patient's depression or anxiety worsens.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and consider diuresis if the patient's fluid overload persists.
10. Consider consulting cardiology if the patient's hypotension persists and cardiogenic shock is suspected."
