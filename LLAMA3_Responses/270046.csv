Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She was previously admitted to an inpatient psych unit and received 180mg of valium in the emergency department without effect. The patient's symptoms are consistent with EtOH withdrawal, and she has improved with valium administration.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: likely EtOH withdrawal, with improvement with valium administration
* Tachycardia: 97-123 bpm
* Hypertension: 153/87 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 95%
* Fever: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs): mild hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 3
* Pancytopenia: likely due to chronic alcohol use
* Hyperbilirubinemia: unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis
* HTN: restarted clonidine in patch form due to marked HTN

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Worsening of EtOH withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and delirium
* Development of infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, which can be exacerbated by the patient's altered mental status and compromised immune system
* Hemorrhage due to pancytopenia and coagulopathy
* Liver failure or acute liver injury due to prolonged EtOH use and potential underlying liver disease
* Kidney injury or failure due to dehydration, hypovolemia, and potential underlying kidney disease
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to tachycardia and hypertension
* Respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, due to tachypnea and potential underlying respiratory disease

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition, including:

* Continuous vital sign monitoring
* Aggressive fluid repletion and electrolyte management
* Close monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation studies
* Antibiotic stewardship and careful consideration of antibiotic use in the presence of altered mental status
* Pain management and symptom control for EtOH withdrawal symptoms
* Close communication with the patient and her family to ensure informed decision-making and management of her condition."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   This is a 44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for
   concern for EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED
   without effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.
   Psych consult advised that symptoms c/w EtOh withdrawal and not acute
   psychosis
   # Altered mental statu:   Likely [**1-23**] EtOH withdrawal as patient has
   improved with valium.   No fevers per records and no leukocytosis.
   Unclear if underlying infection playing a role. CXR WNL and U/A was
   negative. BCx and UCx sent. Mild hyperbilirubinemia with a TB of 3.
   Serum and urine tox screen were positive for only benzos which the pt
   receives on a regular basis. Pt reports last drink of alcohol was this
   past Friday.
   -Valium 15-30mg iv for CIWA>10
   - no signs/symptoms or clinical evidence for meningitis, no indication
   for LP at this time, will not continue ABx, D/C droplet precautions
   - RUQ U/S read pending
   # Pancytopenia - [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**] to chronic alcohol use. No prior values for
   comparison. Will send LDH to r/o hemolysis, although unlikely given
   stable HCT over the past two days.
   - will monitor for now
   - Iron studies...
   # HTN
   - restarted clonidine in patch form given marked HTN, may be [**1-23**] to

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She has a history of chronic alcohol use and was last known to have consumed alcohol on Friday. The patient's mental status has been altered, and she was initially considered to have acute psychosis, but a psych consult advised that her symptoms are more likely related to EtOH withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 153/87 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has received valium for CIWA scale, which has improved her delirium. She has also been started on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and haloperidol for Haldol.

The patient's laboratory results show mild hyperbilirubinemia with a TB of 3, and her serum and urine tox screen were positive for only benzos, which she receives on a regular basis. Her complete blood count (CBC) and urinalysis (UA) were negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Altered mental status: likely EtOH withdrawal, with a plan to continue valium for CIWA >10.
2. Pancytopenia: likely related to chronic alcohol use, with a plan to monitor and send LDH to rule out hemolysis.
3. HTN: restarted clonidine in patch form due to marked HTN, which may be related to withdrawal/psychosis.
4. FEN: NPO except meds for now, with aggressive lyte repletion and IVF with bolus as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Seizures: due to EtOH withdrawal.
2. Infection: despite negative CXR and UA, there is a possibility of an underlying infection playing a role in the patient's altered mental status.
3. Hemorrhage: due to pancytopenia and chronic alcohol use.
4. Rebound hypertension: due to the patient's history of HTN and the need to restart clonidine.
5. Malnutrition: due to NPO status and potential for prolonged ICU stay.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or manage these potential complications."

The patient, a 44-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with concerns of ethanol withdrawal. She was transferred from an inpatient psychiatric unit after experiencing altered mental status, likely related to ethanol withdrawal. The patient received 180mg of valium in the ED without effect, and a psych consult recommended continuing the CIWA scale as the patient appeared to be withdrawing from ethanol and not in acute psychosis. The patient's delirium improved significantly with valium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 97bpm, and blood pressure of 153/87mmHg. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and haloperidol. The patient's lab results show mild hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 3, and serum and urine tox screen were positive for only benzos, which she receives on a regular basis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to ethanol withdrawal, which can be life-threatening.
2. Infection: The patient's delirium and altered mental status may be related to an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to chronic alcohol use, and further evaluation is needed to rule out hemolysis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be related to ethanol withdrawal or psychosis, and monitoring is necessary to prevent rebound hypertension.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and aggressive repletion is necessary to prevent dehydration or overhydration.
6. Nutritional deficiency: The patient is NPO except for medications, and nutritional support is necessary to prevent malnutrition.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to ethanol withdrawal and altered mental status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue CIWA scale monitoring and adjust medication as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely for signs of infection or other complications.
3. Consider restarting antibiotics if the patient's condition deteriorates or if there is evidence of an underlying infection.
4. Continue prophylactic heparin and haloperidol.
5. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and nutritional status closely.
6. Consider restarting the patient's home regimen for hypertension.
7. Plan for outpatient follow-up to monitor the patient's progress and address any ongoing medical issues."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.  Psych
   consult advised that symptoms c/w EtOh withdrawal and not acute
   psychosis
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by Etoh withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially were
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Pt is currently 8 days away from
   last Etoh use and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.  Will
   follow with psych today as to other recommendations for management
   seeing that the Benzo therapy and Haldol has not been as effective.
   Psych currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to
   see if pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.
   -Will continue Valium 15-30mg iv for CIWA>10, IV Haldol pending further
   Psych recs
   # Pancytopenia - [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**] to chronic alcohol use, pancytopenia has
   improved over the past few days.
   - will continue to trend
   - hemolysis labs negative
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S
   taken on [**1-5**] showed cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of
   cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch yesterday. Pt has been
   hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be withdrawal may
   actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN after her
   Clonidine patch was d/c
   - Will continue to trend, goal SBP is 120-160s.

Summary:

The patient, a 44-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180mg of valium in the ED without effect, and the psych consult advised that symptoms are consistent with EtOH withdrawal, not acute psychosis. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, hallucinations, and extreme agitation, which have responded to valium and haldol. She has also been experiencing pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension.

Medical Complications:

1. Delirium tremens: The patient's symptoms are consistent with delirium tremens, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Seizures: The patient's history of EtOH withdrawal and altered mental status increases the risk of seizures.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be related to chronic alcohol use, and monitoring is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The cause of the patient's hyperbilirubinemia is unclear, and monitoring is necessary to rule out hemolysis.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be related to withdrawal or psychosis, and monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's aggressive lyte repletion and high fluid intake may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalance.
7. VAP: The patient's use of invasive lines increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Recommendations:

1. Continue valium and haldol as needed to manage delirium tremens and agitation.
2. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia closely to prevent bleeding complications and rule out hemolysis.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with clonidine and monitor for rebound hypertension.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance closely to prevent complications.
5. Consider switching to a non-invasive oxygen delivery device to reduce the risk of VAP.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status and neurological function closely to prevent further complications."

   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.  Psych
   consult advised that symptoms c/w EtOh withdrawal and not acute
   psychosis.
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt
   is currently 9 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. .Psych
   currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to see if
   pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, including delirium tremens, seizures, and altered mental status. The patient received 180 mg of valium in the emergency department without effect, and psych consult advised that symptoms are consistent with EtOH withdrawal, not acute psychosis.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Agitation and delirium, requiring multiple doses of haldol and valium
* Pancytopenia, with platelet count 119 and hematocrit 31%
* Hyperbilirubinemia, with total bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL
* Hypertension, which may be related to EtOH withdrawal or rebound hypertension after discontinuation of clonidine patch

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 3.8-6.8 K/uL
* Hct: 31.6-32.7%
* Plt: 81-119 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 86-93 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.6/28.9/1.4, ALT/AST: 16/37, Alk Phos/T Bili: 64/2.0, Albumin: 4.0 g/dL, LDH: 250 IU/L, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing haldol prn q1h per psych recommendations
* Holding valium
* Performing q-day EKG to monitor QTc
* Following up on RPR and thiamine labs
* Trending bilirubin and platelet count
* Continuing clonidine patch for hypertension
* Starting on regular diet and repleting electrolytes as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to pancytopenia
* Increased risk of infection due to pancytopenia and potential immunosuppression
* Increased risk of liver damage or failure due to hyperbilirubinemia
* Increased risk of cardiovascular complications due to hypertension
* Increased risk of respiratory complications due to delirium and agitation
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal complications due to altered mental status and potential electrolyte imbalance

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for EtOH withdrawal, specifically delirium tremens. She has been receiving treatment for her symptoms, including valium and haldol, but has continued to experience agitation and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Pancytopenia, with a platelet count of 119 and hemoglobin of 31.8 g/dL
* Hyperbilirubinemia, with a total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL
* Elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST
* Abnormal coagulation studies, including a prolonged PT and PTT
* Hypocalcemia, with a calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL
* Hypomagnesemia, with a magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL
* Hypophosphatemia, with a phosphate level of 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/64 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 95%.

The patient's physical examination is significant for ecchymoses periorbitally, a regular heart rate, and soft, bowel sounds present. Her neurological examination is normal.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic EtOH use, and she has been experiencing symptoms consistent with EtOH withdrawal, including agitation, tremors, and altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results suggest that she may have underlying liver disease, as evidenced by the elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's coagulation studies are abnormal, which may be contributing to her bleeding diathesis.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued haldol therapy for agitation, as well as continued monitoring of her laboratory results and vital signs. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Continued progression of EtOH withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, hallucinations, and delirium
* Development of liver failure, as evidenced by the patient's laboratory results
* Bleeding diathesis, due to the patient's abnormal coagulation studies
* Hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, which can contribute to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications
* Infection, due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and potential for nosocomial infections in the ICU.

Overall, this patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address her underlying medical conditions and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, specifically delirium tremens (DTS). She has a history of unreliable information, but it is reported that she is 9 days away from her last EtOH use. She received 180mg of valium in the emergency department without effect, and psych consult advised that her symptoms are consistent with EtOH withdrawal rather than acute psychosis. The patient's altered mental status is unclear, with components that could be explained by EtOH withdrawal or psychosis. She has been treated with haldol 5-10mg IV q1h prn for agitation, and psych is following up with the patient's mental health center to gather more information.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia (low platelet count and hematocrit), which is improving. Her bilirubin levels are elevated, but hemolysis labs are negative. She has cholelithiasis (gallstones) on ultrasound, but no signs of cholestasis. Her hypertension is thought to be related to her Clonidine patch, which was restarted several days ago.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Seizures: Due to the patient's EtOH withdrawal and potential benzodiazepine intoxication.
2. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's altered mental status and potential respiratory depression.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: Due to the patient's prolonged QTc interval and potential benzodiazepine-induced cardiac effects.
4. Infections: Due to the patient's compromised immune system and pancytopenia.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: Due to the patient's cholelithiasis and potential cholestasis.
6. Hypertensive crisis: Due to the patient's hypertension and potential rebound hypertension after Clonidine patch discontinuation.
7. Thiamine deficiency: Due to the patient's EtOH withdrawal and potential malnutrition.
8. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Due to the patient's EtOH withdrawal and potential malnutrition.
9. Folate deficiency: Due to the patient's EtOH withdrawal and potential malnutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's EtOH withdrawal with haldol and other medications as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including pancytopenia, bilirubin levels, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with Clonidine patch and other medications as necessary.
5. Consider starting thiamine and vitamin B12 supplements to prevent deficiency.
6. Consider starting folate supplements to prevent deficiency.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and consider further evaluation for cholelithiasis and cholestasis.
8. Consider further evaluation for potential infections, including blood cultures and imaging studies.
9. Consider further evaluation for potential cardiac arrhythmias, including electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring."

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: EtOh withdrawal/delirium
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient remained very agitated during the day.  She had received
   ~ 620 mg of valium total yesterday and this am, so psych recommended
   using haldol instead of valium as she was likely valium intoxicated.
   She got 10 mg of po haldol x 2, then 30 mg IV valium x 1, then 5 mg of
   zyprexa x 1 and continued to have agitation.  She then received another
   10 mg IV valium.  Psych was recontacted and recommended giving 5 mg IV
   haldol q1h prn.  She became so agitated that security had to be called
   non-urgently to place leather restraints as she was almost climbing out
   of bed with the cloth restraints in place.  She continued to receive
   haldol q1h, but her agitation grew and psych had to come and reevalute
   her.  They felt her agitation was consistent with delirium and
   continued to recommend avoid benzos and giving haldol 5-10 mg q1h prn.
   As her QTc was becoming getting longer (up to 466) they stated if it
   became > 500, she could be loaded with depakote orally.  Also wanted to
   check an EKG after each haldol dose.
   - TSH, Vit B12, folate, haptoglobin, and thiamine was ordered.  TSH,
   Vit B12, and folate were WNL.  haptoglobin < 20.

   psychosis.

   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for EtOH withdrawal, specifically delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. She was previously treated with valium, but due to potential benzo intoxication, haldol was introduced as an alternative. Despite this, her agitation persisted, and she required increasing doses of haldol. Her QTc interval has been prolonged, and she has been ordered to receive regular EKG monitoring. Her other labs, including TSH, Vit B12, folate, and haptoglobin, are within normal limits. She has pancytopenia, with a platelet count of 119 and hematocrit of 31.8, which is improving. She also has hyperbilirubinemia, with a total bilirubin of 2, and is being monitored for potential causes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Agitation and Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of falls, self-injury, or injury to others.
2. Prolonged QTc Interval: The prolonged QTc interval increases the risk of torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, infection, or other complications.
4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia may indicate liver dysfunction or cholestasis, which can lead to further complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to pancytopenia may increase the risk of infection.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's altered mental status and decreased appetite may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's agitation and delirium closely, and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Regularly monitor the patient's QTc interval and adjust treatment to minimize the risk of torsades de pointes.
3. Continue to trend the patient's pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia, and investigate potential causes.
4. Manage the patient's hypertension effectively to minimize the risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Implement infection prevention measures, such as proper hand hygiene and isolation precautions.
6. Ensure the patient receives adequate nutrition and hydration to minimize the risk of malnutrition.
7. Consider consulting with a psychiatrist to determine the most appropriate antipsychotic agent for the patient's symptoms."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol 5mg q4h po given intemittently
   escalating agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium and monitor for benzo withdrawal.
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc, monitor and replete K and Mg.
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   thiamine pending
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 yesterday, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU from an inpatient psych unit for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180mg of valium in the ED without effect, and her mental status was unclear due to possible acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal. She was started on haloperidol 5mg po q4h standing, which improved her agitation. However, there is concern for benzodiazepine (benzo) withdrawal. Her physical examination shows a soft abdomen with mild tenderness in the epigastric region, and lab results show pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient is at risk for benzo withdrawal due to the significant amount of IV valium she received, which accumulates in adipose tissue and will slowly decrease over time. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal is crucial.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is improving, but it is essential to continue monitoring and trending lab results to ensure it does not worsen.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The cause of the patient's hyperbilirubinemia is unclear, and it is essential to continue trending lab results to monitor for any changes.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is stabilized with the clonidine patch, but it is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting the patch as needed.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's abdominal examination is benign, but it is essential to monitor for any signs of gastrointestinal distress or complications.
6. Respiratory issues: The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on RA, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.21. Monitoring her respiratory status and adjusting oxygen therapy as needed is crucial.
7. Infectious complications: The patient's blood culture, urine culture, and sputum culture are pending, and it is essential to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status is improving, but it is essential to continue monitoring her neurological status and adjusting treatment as needed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's benzo withdrawal symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Continue trending lab results for pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension.
3. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Continue to hold valium and monitor for signs of withdrawal.
7. Continue to trend bilirubin levels and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust the clonidine patch as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol now at 5mg tid
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium and monitor for benzo withdrawal.
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc, monitor and replete K and Mg.
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   thiamine pending
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 yesterday, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.  Likely from breakdown of her recent bruises.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.
   - continue clonidine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU from an inpatient psych unit due to concern for EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect, and her altered mental status is unclear as to its etiology, with components potentially explained by EtOH withdrawal and psychosis. She has been treated with haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation, and her CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* SpO2: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Middle-aged female lying in bed in no acute distress
* Eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL, bilateral ecchymoses periorbitally
* Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
* Peripheral vascular: 2+ distal pulses bilaterally
* Respiratory/chest: Clear to auscultation
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present, mild tenderness in the epigastric region
* Extremities: No edema or cyanosis
* Skin: Warm, healing bruises on the face
* Neurologic: Alert and oriented to person, place, month, and year

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.9 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 169 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.6/28.9/1.4, ALT/AST: 16/37, Alk Phos/T Bili: 64/2.0, Albumin: 4.0 g/dL, LDH: 250 IU/L, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient has received a significant amount of IV valium, which accumulates in adipose tissue and will slowly decrease over time. However, it is essential to monitor for benzo withdrawal.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's total bilirubin level is elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction or hemolysis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be a concern for cardiac complications.
5. EtOH withdrawal: The patient is 10 days away from her last EtOH use, and it is essential to monitor her for signs of withdrawal.
6. Agitation: The patient's agitation may lead to physical harm or injury, and it is essential to continue monitoring her for signs of agitation.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex, and it is crucial to monitor her closely for potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol now at 5mg tid
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium and monitor for benzo withdrawal.
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc, monitor and replete K and Mg.
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   thiamine pending
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 yesterday, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.  Likely from breakdown of her recent bruises.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.
   - continue clonidine patch

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 3474**] has required less Haldol over the past 24 hours and only 10
   mg Valium overnight. She is now oriented to place and time too and does
   admit to a long term pattern of alcohol abuse. Last period of
   abstinence was greater than 2 years ago. She does feel anxious
   Exam notable for Tm of 99.1 BP of 121/66 HR of 74 RR of 10 with sats of
   95% on RA. She has good air movement in all lung fields. She is not
   tremulous. There is no peripheral edema. Labs notable for WBC 10.9 K,
   HCT of 32.8 , K+  of 4.0, Cr of 0.6. EKG shows QTc fo 0.472 ms
   Agree with plan to transition to standing PO haldol and prn Valium. She
   will need transfer to Psych facility if psychiatrists decide that is
   best for her safety and assessment. She is medically cleared at this
   time
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180mg of valium in the ED without effect, and her altered mental status is unclear, possibly due to EtOH withdrawal or psychosis.

The patient's current status is:

* Oriented to person, place, and time
* Admits to pain in her lower back and abdomen
* Has improved agitation with standing Haldol 5mg q4h
* Has a history of chronic alcohol use and is 10 days away from last EtOH use
* Has not been diaphoretic or displayed tremors
* Has elevated CIWA scale due to agitated state
* Has pancytopenia (Ptl 169, Hct 32.8) which is improving
* Has hyperbilirubinemia (T-bili 2) which is likely due to breakdown of recent bruises
* Has hypertension which has stabilized with continued Clonidine patch

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient has received a significant amount of IV valium which accumulates in adipose tissue and will slowly decrease over time. However, the patient needs to be monitored for benzo withdrawal.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is improving, but it is essential to continue monitoring and trending her lab results to ensure that her counts remain stable.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia is likely due to breakdown of recent bruises, but it is essential to trend her bilirubin levels to ensure that it does not worsen.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has stabilized with continued Clonidine patch, but it is essential to continue monitoring her blood pressure to ensure that it remains under control.
5. EtOH withdrawal: The patient's EtOH withdrawal symptoms are improving, but it is essential to continue monitoring her for signs of withdrawal, such as tremors, diaphoresis, and agitation.
6. Psychiatric complications: The patient's psychiatric history and symptoms are unclear, and it is essential to continue monitoring her mental status and provide appropriate psychiatric care.

The plan for the patient includes:

* Continue standing Haldol 5mg q4h and prn as needed
* Monitor for benzo withdrawal
* Trend pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia lab results
* Continue Clonidine patch for hypertension
* Monitor for signs of EtOH withdrawal
* Provide psychiatric care and consider transfer to a psych facility if deemed necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt
   is currently 9 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. .Psych
   currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to see if
   pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will start standin haldol 5mg po given intemittently escalating
   agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 119, hct 31 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   RPR pending, thiamine pending
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 this morning, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the emergency department without effect. Her mental status has been altered, and it is unclear whether it is due to EtOH withdrawal or acute psychosis. She has been receiving haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation, and her CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. Her lab results show pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypertension. She has been restarted on her clonidine patch, and her blood pressure has stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient is at risk of benzo withdrawal due to the accumulation of valium in her adipose tissue. Close monitoring is necessary to watch for signs of withdrawal.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may be due to chronic alcohol use or another underlying condition. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and to monitor her blood counts.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The cause of the patient's hyperbilirubinemia is unclear. Further evaluation, including liver function tests and imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the cause and to monitor her liver function.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be due to her clonidine patch or another underlying condition. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure that her blood pressure remains under control.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation, including a thorough physical examination and imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the cause of her elevated white blood cell count.
6. Thiamine deficiency: The patient's pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia may be due to a thiamine deficiency. Further evaluation, including thiamine levels and imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the cause and to monitor her thiamine levels.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia may be due to liver dysfunction. Further evaluation, including liver function tests and imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the cause and to monitor her liver function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and to adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood counts and to adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and to adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
4. Consider further evaluation, including imaging studies and liver function tests, to determine the cause of the patient's hyperbilirubinemia and pancytopenia.
5. Consider further evaluation, including thiamine levels and imaging studies, to determine the cause of the patient's pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and to adjust her treatment plan as necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation, including a thorough physical examination and imaging studies, to determine the cause of the patient's elevated white blood cell count."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Thes yesterday when patient
   continued to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she
   was benzo intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt
   is currently 9 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state. .Psych
   currently is getting in touch with the MH centre in [**Location (un) 1792**] to see if
   pt has any psych diagnoses or medication regimens.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will start standin haldol 5mg po given intemittently escalating
   agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 119, hct 31 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   RPR pending, thiamine pending
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 this morning, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
   - Will continue to trend, goal SBP is 120-160s.
   - continue clonidine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal. She received 180 mg of valium in the ED without effect, and her altered mental status is unclear as to its etiology. She has components that would be explained by EtOH withdrawal, but also for psychosis. She was started on haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation, but psych was reconsulted and it was decided that her symptoms were likely due to EtOH withdrawal. She has been taking haldol 5mg po q4h standing, which has significantly reduced her agitation. She is currently 9 days away from her last EtOH use and has not displayed typical symptoms of withdrawal such as diaphoresis or tremors.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia, with a platelet count of 119 and hematocrit of 31. Her hyperbilirubinemia is unclear in cause, but her ultrasound showed cholelithiasis at the neck of the gallbladder. She has been restarted on her clonidine patch, which has been effective in controlling her blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 33 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient has been taking valium and haldol, which can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, tremors, and agitation. The patient's psych has recommended continuing the haldol, but the patient may need to be monitored closely for signs of withdrawal.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low platelet count and hematocrit may indicate a bleeding disorder or bone marrow suppression. The patient may need to be monitored for signs of bleeding, and further laboratory testing may be necessary to determine the cause of the pancytopenia.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's high bilirubin levels may indicate liver dysfunction or hemolysis. The patient may need to be monitored for signs of liver failure, and further laboratory testing may be necessary to determine the cause of the hyperbilirubinemia.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure may need to be monitored closely, as it may be a sign of underlying cardiovascular disease. The patient may need to be started on antihypertensive medication to control her blood pressure.
5. EtOH withdrawal: The patient may need to be monitored closely for signs of EtOH withdrawal, such as seizures, tremors, and agitation. The patient may need to be started on medication to manage her withdrawal symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old female admitted to the ICU for concern of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, with a history of unreliable information. She was initially treated with IV valium without effect, and then started on haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation. Her mental status has improved significantly, and she is now consistently oriented to person and place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg. Her respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's lab results show mild pancytopenia, improving trend, and hyperbilirubinemia, with no clear cause.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient has been receiving high doses of IV valium, which can lead to benzodiazepine withdrawal if not tapered properly. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, but the risk of withdrawal symptoms is still present.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 119, and her hemoglobin level is 31%. While the trend is improving, the patient is still at risk for bleeding complications.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's total bilirubin level is 2.0 mg/dL, which is above the normal range. The cause is unclear, and the patient's liver function tests are pending.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 102/51 mmHg, which is above the normal range. The patient has a history of hypertension, and her Clonidine patch has been restarted.
5. Delirium: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which can be a sign of delirium. The patient's mental status has improved, but the risk of delirium is still present.
6. Infection: The patient has a central line in place, which can increase the risk of infection. The patient's white blood cell count is 3.8, which is below the normal range.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 119, which is below the normal range. The patient's hemoglobin level is 31%, which is below the normal range.

Recommendations:

1. Continue benzodiazepine taper: The patient should be continued on haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation, and the dose should be tapered gradually to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms.
2. Monitor pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count and hemoglobin level should be monitored closely to ensure that they are improving.
3. Investigate hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's liver function tests should be completed to determine the cause of her hyperbilirubinemia.
4. Monitor hypertension: The patient's blood pressure should be monitored closely to ensure that it remains within the normal range.
5. Monitor for delirium: The patient's mental status should be monitored closely for signs of delirium.
6. Monitor for infection: The patient's central line should be monitored closely for signs of infection, and the patient's white blood cell count should be monitored to ensure that it remains within the normal range.
7. Monitor for thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count should be monitored closely to ensure that it remains within the normal range."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will start standing haldol 5mg q4h po given intemittently escalating
   agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   RPR pending, thiamine pending
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 this morning, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.
   - continue clonidine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 44-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU for concern about ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal and altered mental status. She received 180mg of valium in the ED without effect and was started on haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation. Her mental status has improved, and she is currently oriented to person, place, and time. She is experiencing pain in her lower back and abdomen and has a history of chronic alcohol use.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient received a significant amount of IV valium, which accumulates in adipose tissue and will slowly decrease over time. However, the patient's mental status has improved, and her agitation has decreased, but the patient is still at risk for benzo withdrawal.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 169, and her hemoglobin is 32.8. This is a potential complication of chronic alcohol use, and the patient's labs are pending for B12 and folate.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin level is 2, which is down from 3 on admission. The cause of this is unclear, and the patient's ultrasound showed cholelithiasis at the neck of the gallbladder but no signs of cholestasis.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has stabilized, and she is currently on a clonidine patch. However, her initial hypertension was thought to be related to EtOH withdrawal and rebound hypertension after her clonidine patch was discontinued.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's respiratory culture is pending, and her blood culture is pending. She has a history of chronic alcohol use and is at risk for infectious complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal exam is benign, but she has a history of chronic alcohol use, which can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as pancreatitis or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's EKG is pending, and her QTc is being monitored. She has a history of chronic alcohol use, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her medication as needed.
2. Continue to trend the patient's labs, including her platelet count, hemoglobin, and bilirubin level.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory and gastrointestinal status and adjust her medication as needed.
5. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist or a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal and cardiovascular status.
6. Consider starting the patient on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to prevent stress ulceration.
7. Consider starting the patient on a thiamine supplement to prevent thiamine deficiency.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutrition and adjust her diet as needed.
9. Consider starting the patient on a stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's code status and adjust it as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o female admitted from an inpatient psych unit for concern for
   EtOH withdrawal.  Patient received 180 mg valium in the ED without
   effect.  Concern for acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, now
   improving.
    # Altered mental status:  Unclear as to the etiology of the pt
   altered mental status, she does have components that would be explained
   by EtoH withdrawal but also for psychosis. Psych initially was
   concerned about Benzo intoxication, and recommended IV Haldol however
   given lack of response psych was reconsulted and it was decided
   symptoms were [**1-23**] EtoH withdrawal. Then two days when patient continued
   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol 5mg q4h po given intemittently
   escalating agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium and monitor for benzo withdrawal.
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   thiamine pending
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 yesterday, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.
   - continue clonidine patch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   to be unresponsive to BZ, psych reevaluated and felt that she was benzo
   intoxicated and recommended halol q1h prn for agitation.  Pt is
   currently 10 days away from last EtoH use (though her history is
   unreliable) and has not been diaphoretic, or displayed tremors. Her
   CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.
   - psych following, appreciate recs
   - will continue standing haldol 5mg q4h po given intemittently
   escalating agitation with only prn dosing
   - continue haldol prn q1h per psych recs
   - continue to hold valium and monitor for benzo withdrawal.
   - qday EKG to monitor QTc
   - f/u RPR and thiamine
   # Pancytopenia - Ptl 169, hct 32.8 this morning, improving.  [**Month (only) 11**] be [**1-23**]
   to chronic alcohol use.  Hemolysis labs negative. B12 and folate wnl,
   thiamine pending
   - will continue to trend
   # Hyperbilirubinemia:  T-bili 2 yesterday, down from 3 on admission.
   Unclear cause, no evidence of hemolysis. U/S taken on [**1-5**] showed
   cholelithiasis at neck of Gb but not signs of cholestasis. Pt
s abdomen
   exam is also benign.
   - trend bilirubin
   # HTN : Pt was restarted on her Clonidine patch several days ago. Pt
   had been hypertensive from SBP 150s-190s initially thought to be
   withdrawal may actually be a component of her agitation and rebound HTN
   after her Clonidine patch was d/c
d.   As her agitation has improved,
   her BP
s have stabilized.
   - continue clonidine patch

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for concern of EtOH withdrawal and altered mental status. The patient received 180mg of valium in the ED without effect, and the psych team was consulted. The patient was initially thought to be experiencing acute psychosis vs. alcohol withdrawal, but is now improving.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 75bpm, blood pressure of 102/51mmHg, and respiratory rate of 33insp/min. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on RA.

The patient's laboratory results show pancytopenia with a platelet count of 169K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6g/dL, and hematocrit of 32.8%. Her liver function tests are elevated, with an AST of 37U/L and ALT of 16U/L. Her bilirubin level is 2.0mg/dL, and her albumin level is 4.0g/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic alcohol use, and she is currently 10 days away from her last EtOH use. She has not been diaphoretic or displayed tremors, and her CIWA scale has been elevated only due to her agitated state.

The patient's medications include pantoprazole, haloperidol, and clonidine patch. She is being monitored for benzodiazepine withdrawal, and her valium has been held.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Benzo withdrawal syndrome: The patient is at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms due to the held valium and the ongoing use of haloperidol.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient's low platelet count and hemoglobin levels increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels may indicate liver dysfunction or cholestasis, which can lead to complications such as jaundice, pruritus, and liver failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and if not controlled, may lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and kidney damage.
5. Thiamine deficiency: The patient's thiamine levels are pending, but may be deficient due to chronic alcohol use, which can lead to complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis.
6. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to chronic alcohol use and pancytopenia increases the risk of infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that she be closely monitored for signs of benzo withdrawal, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypertension, thiamine deficiency, and infection."
