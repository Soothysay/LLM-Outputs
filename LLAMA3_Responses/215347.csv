   Assessment and Plan
   44-year-old man with hypertensive urgency.  His prior history of
   subarachnoid hemorrhage and PRES is concerning, though his CT and
   improved symptoms are both reassuring.
          Maintain and titrate nitroglycerin for now
          Avoid nitroprusside given renal failure
          Resume all of his home medications
          Treat headache since this may help with BP as well
          Urgent dialysis per renal
          If not improved in the next few hours, or if symptoms
   escalate, will add additional IV [**Doctor Last Name **] such as enalaprilat or
   nicardipine
   Will need further workup of etiology of hypertension.
   Murmur
   His murmur and arterial line tracing both suggest hypertrophic
   obstructive cardiomyopathy, although echo at the beginning of this year
   did not show it.  Repeat echo.
   Anemia
   Is mild.  Follow for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency. He has a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 66 bpm (49-88 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 219/102 mmHg (136-237/109-330 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient has ongoing challenges with blood pressure control, and his arterial line readings are lower than his cuff blood pressure. He is experiencing a headache and has a history of allergy to Ciprofloxacin and Hydralazine.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished general appearance
* Normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat
* Normal cardiac examination with a systolic murmur louder with isorhythmics and quieter with early-stage Valsalva
* Absent radial pulses on both sides, but present digital pulses
* Warm skin
* Attentive and responsive to verbal stimuli, with normal tone and CN II-XII function intact

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 179 K/uL
* Creatinine: 10.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 43 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 5.4 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL
* Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 7.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies, including a CT head, show no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage or changes.

The assessment and plan are as follows:

* Maintain and titrate nitroglycerin for now
* Avoid nitroprusside due to renal failure
* Resume all home medications
* Treat headache as it may help with blood pressure control
* Urgent dialysis is recommended due to renal failure
* If symptoms do not improve in the next few hours or escalate, add additional IV medications such as enalaprilat or nicardipine
* Repeat echo to further evaluate the patient's hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
* Follow the patient's anemia for now

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypertensive encephalopathy
* Cardiac complications due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
* Renal failure progression
* Infection due to indwelling catheters
* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer disease

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications and improve his overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o M with h/o malignant hypertension & ESRD on HD (s/p recent
   removal of transplanted kidney) admitted with hypertensive urgency with
   headache.
   .
   #. Hypertensive urgency: Patient's blood pressure at [**Company 319**] in the
   180s-190s systolic but up to 240s/130s in the ED. Received labetalol
   with good effect but HR down to 50s. Would hold off on further beta
   blockade due to bradycardia until HR recovers. Though nitroglycerin not
   an ideal choice for IV BP control, cannot safely use beta blocker due
   to HR and not a good candidate for nitroprusside due to renal failure.
   Arterial line placed on arrival to the MICU registering blood pressures
   50 points higher systolic than noninvasive monitoring so therefore
   clearly needs more IV BP control.
   - goal BP 160-190/80-100, lower BP might put patient at risk of
   decreased cerebral perfusion at this point since BP elevated to 240s on
   arrival to the ED
   - Arterial line placed for more invasive HD monitoring
   - attempt PO meds --> hydralazine, lisinopril, & diovan per home
   regimen.
   - up titrate nitroglycerin to obtain goal BP
   - if nitroglycerin unable to obtain BP within goal, consider IV
   enalaprilat (ACEi) though this is not an ideal choice as response is
   not predictable
   - consider early (1st morning) dialysis to assist in blood pressure
   control
   .
   #. Headache: Likely related to blood pressure but could be the case
   that headaches are setting off hypertensive episodes.
   - f/u final head CT read
   - morphine for pain while nauseated, when taking POs switch to PO
   regimen (oxycodone in past)
   - compazine prn for nausea
   - can add tylenol when taking POs
   .
   #. ESRD on HD: Will be due for dialysis on Friday, [**8-16**]. Contact Renal
   to let them know patient admitted and will need dialysis.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. The patient's blood pressure was initially elevated, but after receiving labetalol, it decreased to the 180s-190s systolic range.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, and blood pressure of 194/79 mmHg. He is receiving nitroglycerin infusion and morphine sulfate for pain management. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels, indicating potential cardiac and kidney damage.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and the goal is to maintain it between 160-190/80-100 mmHg. If the nitroglycerin infusion is unable to achieve this goal, consideration will be given to IV enalaprilat (ACEi) or early dialysis.
2. Headache: The patient's headache may be related to his blood pressure or potentially setting off hypertensive episodes.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is due for dialysis on Friday and will need to be managed accordingly.
4. Potential cardiac damage: The elevated troponin-T level suggests potential cardiac damage, which will require close monitoring.
5. Kidney damage: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney damage, which may worsen if not managed properly.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but there is no indication of respiratory distress or compromise.

The patient's medications include:

1. Nitroglycerin infusion
2. Morphine sulfate for pain management
3. Hydralazine, lisinopril, and diovan for blood pressure control
4. Sevelamer and renal vitamin for ESRD management
5. Hep sc tid for prophylaxis
6. PPI per home regimen
7. Bowel meds prn

The patient's access lines include:

1. 18-gauge PIV
2. Dialysis catheter
3. 20-gauge PIV
4. Arterial line

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is MICU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted with hypertensive urgency and a headache. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, and he has required HD and various medications to manage his blood pressure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 194/79 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. He is receiving nitroglycerin infusion and morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium levels. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes a recent removal of a transplanted kidney, and he is scheduled for dialysis on Friday.

The patient's plan includes restarting home blood pressure medications, adding back antihypertensives as needed, and considering dialysis if needed to assist in blood pressure control. He is also scheduled to receive dialysis on Friday.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains unstable, and there is a risk of developing a hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiovascular complications.
2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, which may lead to volume overload and exacerbate his hypertension.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate worsening renal function. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the patient's renal function.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. Further investigation is necessary to rule out infection.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, which may indicate cardiac damage. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the patient's cardiac function.

In conclusion, the patient's condition remains unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to manage his blood pressure and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a failed kidney transplant. He was admitted with hypertensive urgency and a headache. His blood pressure was initially high, but it has been controlled with nitro drip and nicardipine. He had a HD session yesterday and received sevelamer and renal vitamin. The patient is currently taking PO medications, including lisinopril and diovan, and is trying to take sips of fluids.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for a warm skin temperature. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 131/65 mmHg, and SpO2 of 98%. His lab results show a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 201 K/uL, and creatinine level of 8.0 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still slightly elevated, and there is a risk of another hypertensive crisis.
2. Kidney damage: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney damage.
3. Infection: The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an infection.
4. Blood clots: The patient is at risk of developing blood clots due to his ESRD and HD therapy.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's SpO2 level is 98%, but there is a risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, due to his underlying medical conditions.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. He had a recent transplant kidney removal. His blood pressure is being managed with nitro drip, nicardipine, and other medications. The patient is receiving HD and has a dialysis catheter in place.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm
* Blood pressure: 131/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 179 K/uL
* Creatinine: 10.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Right and left radial pulses not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, tone not assessed

The patient's plan includes:

* Managing hypertension with nicardipine and other medications
* Continuing HD with sevelamer and renal vitamin supplementation
* Providing pain management with morphine or oxycodone
* Managing nausea with compazine
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment accordingly

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypertensive crisis
* Renal failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Infection
* Sepsis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Respiratory failure

Given the patient's critical illness, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   restarting home meds, and responded dramatically to AM nicardipine SR.
   Now under goal of 150-190.  Will add back antihypertensives as needed
   for blood pressure control.  Discussed with renal, volume overload does
   not appear responsible.
   - Follow Renal recs
   - Would keep clonidine.  Add back [**Last Name (un) 239**] and BB next.
   - Arterial line placed for more invasive HD monitoring.  Will continue
   while in ICU
   - nitroglycerin gtt if necessary for goal BP
   - consider dialysis if needed to assist in blood pressure control
   .
   #. Headache: Likely related to blood pressure but could be the case
   that headaches are setting off hypertensive episodes.   Final head CT
   neg for bleed.
   - Tylenol for pain.  Can add morphine if needed.
   - compazine prn for nausea
   .
   #. ESRD on HD: Will be due for dialysis on Friday, [**8-16**].
   - Restart sevelamer & renal vitamin

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. He has been receiving HD and has responded to nicardipine SR, with blood pressures now under goal of 150-190 mmHg. He is being managed with a combination of antihypertensive medications and has had an arterial line placed for more invasive HD monitoring. He is also receiving treatment for headache, including Tylenol and morphine as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis if not properly managed.
2. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of volume overload if not managed properly.
3. Headache: The patient's headache is likely related to his blood pressure, but could also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a bleed.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with HD, and there is a risk of complications such as dialysis-related hypotension or hypertension.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of invasive lines and catheters increase his risk of infection.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's presence of invasive lines and catheters increases his risk of thrombosis.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and the presence of invasive lines and catheters increase his risk of bleeding.

Assessment and plan:

The patient is currently being managed with a combination of antihypertensive medications and HD. He is being closely monitored for signs of hypertensive crisis, volume overload, and other complications. The plan is to continue HD and adjust antihypertensive medications as needed to maintain blood pressure control. The patient will also be monitored for signs of headache, ESRD, infection, thrombosis, and bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), was admitted with hypertensive urgency and a headache. He had a recent transplant kidney removal and was experiencing blood pressure control issues. The patient was treated with nicardipine SR, and his blood pressure improved. He was also restarted on his home antihypertensives and minoxidil was added per renal recommendations. The patient had an orthostatic episode, but it resolved. His headache resolved, and he was given Tylenol for pain.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
* Heart rate: 55 bpm
* Blood pressure: 182/99 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 38.6%
* Platelet count: 183 K/uL
* Creatinine: 10.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 90 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he may require further management to control his blood pressure.
2. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient experienced an orthostatic episode, and it is essential to monitor him for any signs of hypotension.
3. Headache: Although the patient's headache has resolved, it is essential to monitor him for any signs of recurrent headaches.
4. Kidney function: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and it is essential to monitor his kidney function closely.
5. Blood clotting: The patient's platelet count is slightly elevated, and it is essential to monitor him for any signs of bleeding or clotting disorders.
6. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and it is essential to monitor him for any signs of infection.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, and it is essential to monitor him for any signs of fluid overload.
8. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and it is essential to monitor him for any signs of respiratory compromise.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his antihypertensives as needed.
2. Monitor the patient for any signs of orthostatic hypotension and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's headache and adjust his pain management as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and adjust his dialysis schedule as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's blood clotting and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient for any signs of infection and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory rate and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of malignant hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) following the removal of a transplanted kidney. He was admitted with hypertensive urgency and headache. The patient's condition is being managed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Key findings:

* The patient's blood pressure (BP) is still elevated, with readings ranging from 117/67 mmHg to 191/109 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving minoxidil to help control his hypertension.
* He is on sevelamer and renal vitamins, and his lyte management is being managed per renal team.
* The patient is having difficulty taking oral medications and is receiving sips of fluid and medications via nasogastric tube (NGT).
* He is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's BP remains elevated, which increases the risk of hypertensive crisis, cardiac damage, and stroke.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and HD requirements may lead to further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and NSAIDs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and potential fluid overload may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's BP closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Consider adding additional antihypertensive medications to control the patient's BP.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust HD requirements as necessary.
4. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.
5. Consider starting antibiotics for empiric coverage of potential infections.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medications as necessary to minimize the risk of bleeding.
7. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of potential cardiac complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of malignant hypertension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various treatments and assessments.

Summary:

* The patient's blood pressure has improved slightly, with a current reading of 191/109 mmHg, down from previous readings of 129/79 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving minoxidil to manage his hypertension.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
* The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 983 mL over the past 24 hours, with a net intake of 983 mL and a net output of 0 mL.
* The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 10.1 mg/dL and a decreased platelet count of 183 K/uL.
* The patient's neurological examination is non-focal, and his physical examination is otherwise unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and there is a risk of further hypertensive crisis or cardiac complications if not managed appropriately.
* Renal damage: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal damage or dysfunction, which could lead to further complications if not addressed.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's decreased platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding or bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and elevated troponin-T level may indicate cardiac damage or dysfunction, which could lead to further complications if not managed appropriately."
