   CONCLUSION:
   Extensive artifact from dental amalgam limits evaluation.
   1. Enlarged enhancing left submandibular gland with two calculi in the
   whartons duct and extensive surrounding inflammatory change in the
   subcutaneous tissues. The appearances are consistent with left
   submandibular
   sialadenitis secondary to obstructive sialoliths.
   2. Several borderline lymph nodes at all stations within the neck as
   described above.

   # Left Facial Swelling:  Patient with left submandibular gland
   infection and large [**Location (un) 7930**] duct stone.  The patient is at risk for
   Ludwig's angina given rate of progression of infection (over 1 day) and
   given that infection already involves left submandibular space, and
   sublingual space.  Has been seen by ENT in ED, without evidence of
   airway compromise.  No evidence of laryngal swelling on scope.  Has
   received antibiotics in ED and one time dose of dexamethasone.  No
   current plans for surgical intervention, but ENT will assess in the
   morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APLS, and lupus nephritis, admitted to the ICU with a large salivary stone with infection underneath, causing left submandibular sialadenitis. She has been treated with antibiotics, and the airway is currently intact. However, there is concern for vocal cord edema and potential airway compromise. The patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection. She is receiving treatment for pain, infection, and dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient is at risk for airway compromise due to the infection and potential vocal cord edema. Close monitoring of her airway and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
2. Ludwig's angina: The patient's infection is rapidly progressing, and she is at risk for Ludwig's angina, a potentially life-threatening condition. Close monitoring of her infection and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
3. Sepsis: The patient's infection could lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her underlying conditions and the infection. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is compromised due to her underlying conditions. Close monitoring of her cardiac status and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
6. Renal complications: The patient's renal function is compromised due to her underlying conditions. Close monitoring of her renal function and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is compromised due to her underlying conditions. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised due to her underlying conditions. Close monitoring of her neurological status and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's airway, respiratory status, and cardiac status.
2. Continue treatment for infection, pain, and dehydration.
3. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, to detect early signs of sepsis.
4. Consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
5. Consider dialysis if the patient's renal function deteriorates.
6. Consider gastrointestinal decompression if the patient's gastrointestinal status deteriorates.
7. Consider neurological evaluation if the patient's neurological status deteriorates.
8. Consider consultation with ENT, cardiology, and nephrology services as necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APA), and glomerulonephritis. She was admitted to the ICU with a large obstructing salivary duct stone and gland inflammation in the left submandibular gland, leading to facial swelling and infection.

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and pain management. She has been diagnosed with sialadenitis secondary to obstructive sialoliths and is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 158/95 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.5%
* Platelet count: 173 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 140 mg/dL

The patient has a CTA neck showing extensive artifact from dental amalgam, which limits evaluation. However, the report notes an enlarged enhancing left submandibular gland with two calculi in the Wharton's duct and extensive surrounding inflammatory change.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection
* Airway compromise due to swelling and inflammation in the submandibular space
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or aspiration
* Cardiovascular complications due to anticoagulation therapy and potential bleeding
* Renal failure due to glomerulonephritis and potential acute kidney injury
* Infection-related sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction

The patient's care plan includes:

* Antibiotics for sialadenitis and potential secondary infections
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and bleeding
* Pain management with IV morphine
* Monitoring for signs of airway compromise, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular complications
* Close monitoring of laboratory results and imaging studies to assess the progression of infection and potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and PE, currently admitted to the ICU due to left facial swelling and a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina given the rapid progression of infection and the involvement of the left submandibular and sublingual spaces.

The patient is receiving antibiotics, and the plan is to continue vancomycin and Unasyn for GN, GP, and anaerobic coverage, with follow-up gland cultures. The patient is also receiving IV dex if evidence of airway compromise, and will be monitored for increased salivation, dysphagia, or stridor.

The patient has a history of PE and renal vein thrombosis, managed on coumadin as an outpatient, and is currently holding coumadin but starting on heparin bridge. The patient also has a history of lupus, managed by Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 7933], and is currently taking cellcept and hydrochlorquine. The patient has significantly improved glomerular nephritis on cellcept, and is also taking prozac for depression and PPI for GERD.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Airway compromise: Given the patient's history of PE and the risk of Ludwig's angina, there is a risk of airway compromise, which could lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient has a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation, which could lead to further infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of PE and renal vein thrombosis, and is currently receiving heparin bridge, which could lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
4. Immunosuppression: The patient is taking immunosuppressive medications, including cellcept and hydrochlorquine, which could increase the risk of infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient has a history of glomerular nephritis, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and previous PE with renal vein thrombosis. She is currently in the ICU with a large obstructing salivary duct stone causing left facial swelling and gland inflammation. The patient has been diagnosed with GN, GP, and aerobic coverage, and is being treated with vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on aerosol-cool O2 delivery.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, but normal platelet count. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are normal. Her troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, indicating no signs of cardiac damage.

The patient's physical examination is notable for left facial and neck swelling, which is tender to palpation. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, and her respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds.

The patient is being treated with IV morphine for pain control, and is receiving humidified oxygen and a humidified shawl mask. She is also receiving IV fluids, electrolytes, and medications, and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, but she is receiving oxygen therapy. If her oxygen saturation drops or her respiratory status deteriorates, she may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is normal, but she has a history of PE and renal vein thrombosis. If she develops cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, she may require cardiology consultation.
3. Infectious complications: The patient has a large obstructing salivary duct stone and is at risk for developing infectious complications, such as abscesses or sepsis. She is receiving antibiotic therapy, but close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
4. Renal complications: The patient has a history of GN and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. If her renal function deteriorates, she may require nephrology consultation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of PE and renal vein thrombosis, and may be at risk for developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures. Close monitoring for signs of neurological deterioration is necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome, and glomerulonephritis. She was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation and left facial swelling. The patient has been experiencing acute pain, dysphagia, and airway compromise, which is being managed with IV antibiotics, IV morphine for pain control, and salivary massage. The patient is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin due to her history of PE and renal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient's airway is at risk due to the large salivary duct stone and gland inflammation, which may lead to aspiration, altered gag reflex, and airway clearance issues.
2. Infection: The patient has a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation, which may lead to further infection and potential sepsis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's high fever (101.6°F) and leukocytosis (WBC 9.3) may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's airway compromise and potential aspiration may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of PE and renal vein thrombosis increases her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GERD and potential aspiration may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome increases her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) should be closely monitored to ensure that her airway is secure and her oxygenation and ventilation are adequate. The patient's IV antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and her pain should be managed with IV morphine. The patient's salivary duct stone should be evaluated further to determine the best course of treatment. The patient's medical history, including her SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome, and glomerulonephritis, should be reviewed to identify any potential complications and develop a plan to manage them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APA), and a history of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) requiring lifelong anticoagulation.

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to left facial swelling and a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn), and is being monitored for signs of airway compromise.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C) at 8:00 PM, and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 97% on an aerosol-cool device.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of an inflammatory response, with an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The patient's liver enzymes are also elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 122 mg/dL and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 17 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for several conditions, including SLE, APA, PE, and glomerulonephritis. The patient is currently taking several medications, including prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and lisinopril.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Airway compromise due to the salivary duct stone and gland inflammation.
2. Infection spread to other parts of the body, including the bloodstream and lungs.
3. Liver damage due to the elevated liver enzymes.
4. Kidney damage due to the glomerulonephritis.
5. Bleeding complications due to the patient's history of PE and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Depression and anxiety due to the patient's complex medical history and hospitalization.

The patient's plan of care includes continued antibiotics, monitoring for signs of airway compromise, and management of the patient's underlying medical conditions. The patient will also be monitored for signs of infection and liver or kidney damage."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and glomerularnephritis, currently admitted to the ICU with a large obstructing salivary duct stone and gland inflammation. The patient is experiencing:

1. Fever (101.6°F) and chills, with blood and urine cultures sent.
2. Incisional pain, with increased frequency of morphine dose.
3. Left facial swelling and tenderness, with no evidence of airway compromise.
4. Acute pain, managed with IV morphine.
5. Respiratory support with aerosol-cool O2 delivery and SpO2 monitoring.
6. Cardiovascular stability, with normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure.
7. Abnormal laboratory results, including elevated WBC count, CRP, and troponin-T levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the infected salivary duct stone and gland inflammation.
2. Respiratory failure due to airway compromise or aspiration.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, secondary to the patient's history of PE and renal vein thrombosis.
4. Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's history of glomerularnephritis and potential dehydration.
5. Infectious complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, given the patient's immunosuppressed state.
6. Bleeding complications, particularly if the patient requires surgical intervention or reversal of anticoagulation therapy.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition, due to the patient's inability to eat and the need for IV hydration and nutrition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuation of IV antibiotics (Vanc/unasyn) for GN, GP, and anaerobic coverage.
2. Salivary massage and gland cultures to monitor the infection.
3. Elevating the head of bed to 30 degrees and humidified oxygen therapy to promote respiratory function.
4. IV hydration and electrolyte repletion.
5. Holding coumadin and starting heparin bridge therapy in case of emergent surgery.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and renal status.
7. Consultation with the ENT and ID services to optimize management of the patient's condition."
