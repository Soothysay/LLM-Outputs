You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Patient's Condition:**

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke and is currently in the ICU for acute pulmonary edema and heart failure.

**Medications:**

The patient is currently taking Furosemide 80mg IV, Lasix, Nitro drip, Haldol, and Ativan. She has a history of allergy to Lasix, but the reaction is uncertain. She is also taking ISMN, Clonidine patch, Amlodipine, and Metoprolol for hypertension.

**Lab Results:**

The patient's lab results show elevated BNP, creatinine, and troponin-T. Her white blood cell count is 11.1 K/uL, and her platelet count is 417. Her potassium level is 4.3 mEq/L, and her magnesium level is 1.6 mg/dL.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI):** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her urine output is decreased, which may indicate AKI.
2. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid balance is positive, which may lead to fluid overload and worsening of her heart failure.
3. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are abnormal, which may lead to electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. **Sepsis:** The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate infection.
5. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her urine output is decreased, which may indicate chronic kidney disease.
6. **Cardiac Arrest:** The patient's code status is full code, which may indicate a risk of cardiac arrest.
7. **Pneumonia:** The patient's respiratory support is being provided through a bipap mask, which may increase the risk of pneumonia.
8. **Urinary Tract Infection:** The patient's urine eos's are pending, and her urine output is decreased, which may indicate urinary tract infection.

**Plan:**

1. Continue diuresis therapy with IV Furosemide 80mg.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as needed.
3. Trend the patient's creatinine level and monitor urine output.
4. Consider restarting statins once the patient's creatinine level returns to normal.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory support and adjust as needed.
6. Consider adding antibiotics if the patient's urine eos's are positive.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as needed.
8. Consider adding vasopressors if the patient's blood pressure is not controlled."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke and presented with symptoms of shortness of breath. She was placed on non-invasive ventilation and was initially managed with CPAP, but required BiPAP intermittently overnight. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 162/81 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a bipap mask and ventilator mode.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to non-adherence to diet and diastolic dysfunction.
2. Hypertension, which is being managed with a combination of medications.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.4 mg/dL.
4. Agitation, which is being managed with geodon, haldol, and ativan.
5. Rhabdomyolysis, which is a complication of statin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of CHF due to non-adherence to diet and diastolic dysfunction.
2. Increased risk of stroke due to hypertension.
3. Further deterioration of renal function due to acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Increased risk of sepsis due to agitated behavior.
5. Complications of statin therapy, such as rhabdomyolysis.
6. Potential for DVT or VAP due to prolonged bed rest and IV therapy.
7. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to CHF and pulmonary edema.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Management of CHF with diuresis therapy and afterload reduction.
2. Optimization of medical management of hypertension.
3. Monitoring of renal function and management of acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Management of agitation with geodon, haldol, and ativan.
5. Avoidance of additional ativan and monitoring of QTc interval.
6. Hold diuresis for now and monitor urine output.
7. Repletion of electrolytes and monitoring of blood glucose levels.
8. Discontinuation of statin therapy.
9. Prophylaxis for DVT and VAP.
10. Full code status and pending disposition to the ICU."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call
   radiology - ? IR procedure)- not emergent study but would change
   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.
   - Psych consulted yesterday but did not come by today.
   - Today's ekg shows normal qt, will check again tomorrow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 77 yof with h/o resistant htn, DM II, Right subclavian
   stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN who presented to the [**Hospital1 1**]
   ED w/ SOB, in fluid overload state with hypertension, progressive renal
   failure (rising Cr) and continued agitation
   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call
   radiology - ? IR procedure)- not emergent study but would change
   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.
   - Psych consulted yesterday but did not come by today.
   - Today's ekg shows normal qt, will check again tomorrow
   - Isosorbide increased to max dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **]

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, DM II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension and presented to the ICU with symptoms of SOB, fluid overload, and progressive renal failure. Her current condition is complicated by hypertension, CHF, and acute on chronic renal failure. She is receiving CPAP for hypoxia and is being managed with a combination of medications to control her blood pressure and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of renal failure: The patient's current creatinine level is 4.1, and her kidney function is likely to continue to decline if not managed properly.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk of developing further fluid overload, which can exacerbate her hypertension and respiratory status.
3. Hypoxia: The patient continues to experience desaturations, which can lead to further respiratory compromise.
4. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium can exacerbate her hypertension and respiratory status, and may require further management with sedatives and antipsychotics.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and CHF put her at risk of developing further cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA and the presence of a central line put her at risk of developing a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
7. Thrombosis: The patient's history of peripheral artery disease and her current use of subcutaneous heparin put her at risk of developing a thrombosis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of DM II and her current use of medications that can affect the gastrointestinal system put her at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medications and fluid management accordingly.
2. Consider non-contrast MRA to rule out RAS and to guide further management of her hypertension and renal failure.
3. Continue to optimize her afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure and to manage her fluid overload.
4. Consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions.
5. Continue to manage her agitation and delirium with sedatives and antipsychotics, and consult with psychiatry and geriatrics as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications and fluids accordingly.
7. Consider hemodialysis for fluid overload state and worsening renal failure.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications and fluids accordingly.
9. Monitor the patient's infection risk and take steps to prevent infections, such as maintaining good hand hygiene and using personal protective equipment.
10. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust her medications and fluids accordingly."

   failure (rising Cr) and continued agitation
   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call
   radiology - ? IR procedure)- not emergent study but would change
   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 y.o. Female with history of resistant HTN, DM II, right
   subclavian stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by
   stroke p/w SOB.
   ##. Hypoxia: continues to have desaturations requiring CPAP.  Etiology
   [**12-24**] to combination of CHF and impaired renal function resulting in
   fluid overload state.  Lasix discontinued for worsening renal function,
   now with Cr of 4.1.  Patient in continued respiratory distress.
   - consider elective endotracheal intubation for improved ventilation
   and sedation for MRA
   - continue to optimize afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant
   effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with failing renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient pressures generally < 130/90 unless agitated, now
   managed with maxed out Isosorbide, hydralazine, ISMN, clonidine patch,
   amlodipine , metoprolol, hydralazine
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - consider addition of lobetalol instead of metoprolol for focused
   vasculature target rather than nodal target
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium
   - continue above regimen with addition of geodon and ativan for
   agitation
   - consider non-contrast MRA to r/o RAS when patient can tolerate
   procedure
   ##. Agitation: patient with continued delirium and agitation,
   exacerbating her hypertension and respiratory status
   - continue home dose of ativan
   - continue geodon IM as patient will not tolerate Zyprexia
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation pending
   endotracheal intubation
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admissionm currently elevated at
   4.1.likely due to substantial pre-renal component as patient may have
   IV depletion.
   - will hold diuresis for elevated Cr, do not want to push into acute
   renal failure
   - considering non-contrast MRA to r/o MRA in setting of resistant
   hypertension once sedated and intubated
   - consider hemodialysis for fluid overload state
 will follow up renal
   recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, fluid overload state, and progressive renal failure.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring. The following potential medical complications may arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with desaturations requiring CPAP. Elective endotracheal intubation may be necessary to improve ventilation and sedation.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with elevated blood pressures and decreased renal function. Optimal afterload reduction and diastolic heart failure management are crucial.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 4.1, likely due to pre-renal components. Holding diuresis and considering non-contrast MRA to rule out renal artery stenosis are essential.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension is labile and may exacerbate cardiac and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring and adjustments to antihypertensive medications are necessary.
5. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium are contributing to her hypertension and respiratory status. Managing agitation with geodon and ativan, and deferring psychiatric and geriatric consultation pending endotracheal intubation, are important.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload state requires close monitoring and management. Consideration of therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis and hemodialysis may be necessary.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA infection and pending blood cultures. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary is crucial.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and repletion is necessary to prevent further complications.

In summary, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications. Elective endotracheal intubation, optimal afterload reduction, and diastolic heart failure management are crucial to improve the patient's respiratory and cardiac status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a complex medical history, including resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and a recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated.

The patient's condition is stable, with a stable blood pressure and heart rate, but she is experiencing oliguria/anuria, which is concerning for acute kidney injury. Her creatinine level is elevated at 4.4, likely due to a pre-renal component.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, and lorazepam, which may be contributing to her bradycardia. Her respiratory status is stable, with a plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O and a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T and creatine kinase (CK), which may indicate cardiac injury. Her white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an inflammatory response.

The patient's radiology reports show bilateral parenchymal opacities, marked cardiomegaly, and moderate right pleural effusion. Her sputum Gram stain is pending, and her blood cultures are pending.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is experiencing oliguria/anuria.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is slow, and her blood pressure is stable.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has bilateral parenchymal opacities and moderate right pleural effusion on her chest radiograph.
4. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
5. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type II, which may be contributing to her cardiac condition.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and pending blood cultures may indicate an inflammatory response.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure may progress to ARDS.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's bradycardia and cardiac injury may increase her risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's pending sputum Gram stain and blood cultures may indicate a bacterial infection.

In summary, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a complex medical history and multiple medical complications, including acute kidney injury, bradycardia, pulmonary edema, hypoxic respiratory failure, and cardiovascular disease. Her potential medical complications include sepsis, ARDS, cardiac arrest, renal failure, and infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 77 y.o. Female with history of resistant HTN, DM II, right
   subclavian stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by
   stroke p/w SOB.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: s/p intubation yesterday for sedation
   for MRA and for tiring on CPAP.  Hypoxic Etiology [**12-24**] to combination of
   CHF and impaired renal function resulting in fluid overload state.
   Lasix discontinued for worsening renal function, now with Cr of 4.4.
   Patient in continued respiratory distress.
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant
   effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with failing renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol ; off Isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 130's to 140's, can add back
   isosorbide/hydralazine as needed
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   metoprolol ; off Isosorbide, hydralazine; off nitro gtt
   - consider non-contrast MRA to r/o RAS; if no RAS, aggressive diuresis
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admissionm currently
   elevated at 4.4.l ikely due to substantial pre-renal component as
   patient may have IVF depletion, in addition to administration of lasix.
   - will hold diuresis for elevated Cr, do not want to push into acute
   renal failure
   - non-contrast MRA to r/o MRA in setting of resistant hypertension now
   that  sedated and intubated
   - consider hemodialysis for fluid overload state and b/c now anuric
   will follow up renal recs

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure due to acute diastolic heart failure and impaired renal function. She was intubated for sedation during an MRA procedure and continued to be in respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 149/42 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on 40% FiO2.

The patient has undergone various interventions, including placement of an arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis. She has also received medications for pain control, agitation, and heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels (4.4 mg/dL) and potassium levels (4.9 mEq/L), indicating acute on chronic renal failure. Her white blood cell count is 11.6 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 343 x 10^9/L.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral parenchymal opacities, marked cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis, and moderate right pleural effusion.

The patient's medical conditions include oliguria/anuria, pain control, altered mental status, pulmonary edema, and acute diastolic heart failure. Her medications include clonidine patch, amlodipine, metoprolol, and subcutaneous heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential IVF depletion.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's continued respiratory distress and potential pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to the patient's acute diastolic heart failure.
4. Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, due to the patient's altered mental status and potential aspiration risk.
5. Bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding from the arterial line, due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential platelet dysfunction.
6. Electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia, due to the patient's kidney dysfunction and potential medication side effects.
7. Worsening of the patient's underlying conditions, such as resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. She has oliguric/anuric kidney function, and her creatinine level has increased to 4.8 mg/dL.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 61 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 166/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure: 8 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 320 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 65 mg/dL
* Glucose: 124 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* No evidence of significant renal artery stenosis on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
* Multiple renal cysts; two lesions in the left kidney may represent hemorrhagic cysts
* No bleed on computed tomography (CT) head

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, acute
* Oliguria/anuria
* Pain control, acute and chronic
* Heart failure, acute (diastolic)
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Pulmonary edema

The patient's medications include:

* Clonidine patch
* Amlodipine
* Metoprolol
* Isosorbide
* Hydralazine
* Nitro drip
* Lasix (furosemide)
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to oliguric/anuric kidney function
* Worsening of heart failure
* Pneumonia due to prolonged intubation
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility
* Stress ulceration due to critical illness
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance
* Electrolyte imbalances due to kidney dysfunction

Based on the patient's current status, I recommend the following:

* Continue to optimize rate control and afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure
* Try psv today and plan for extubation tomorrow
* Consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions
* Consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal function
* Monitor for signs of AKI and adjust medications accordingly
* Continue to manage pain and altered mental status with medications and sedation as needed
* Monitor for signs of pneumonia and DVT
* Monitor for signs of stress ulceration and hypoglycemia
* Monitor for signs of electrolyte imbalances and adjust medications accordingly"

   This is a 77 y.o. Female with history of resistant HTN, DM II, right
   subclavian stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by
   stroke p/w SOB.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: s/p intubation yesterday for sedation
   for MRA and for tiring on CPAP.  Hypoxic etiology [**12-24**] to combination of
   CHF and impaired renal function resulting in fluid overload state
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant
   effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, brady yesterday. metoprolol
   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   off isosorbide, hydralazine; nitro drip
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart
   fent drip and use midaz in boluses
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke. She was intubated yesterday for sedation during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRA) procedure and for tiring on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). She has developed respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, and altered mental status. Her blood pressure is labile, ranging from 120 to 180 systolic, and she has been experiencing bradycardia. She has a history of heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and is currently anuric. She has been prescribed multiple medications, including antihypertensives, diuretics, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in her respiratory status.
2. Oliguria/anuria: The patient's oliguria/anuria may indicate worsening renal function, which could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of underlying neurological or metabolic disorders, which could worsen if not properly managed.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be a sign of excessive beta blockade with medications, sedation, or increased intracranial pressure. If not properly managed, bradycardia could lead to cardiac arrest or other cardiac complications.
5. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in her cardiac status.
6. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the setting of oliguria/anuria and altered mental status.
8. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy and altered coagulation status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize rate control and afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure.
2. Consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions.
3. Consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal function.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and acid-base status closely.
5. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
6. Maintain strict input and output monitoring to ensure accurate fluid management.
7. Consider restarting beta blockers for blood pressure control, but monitor the patient's heart rate and blood pressure closely.
8. Consult with a nephrologist to discuss further management of the patient's chronic renal failure.
9. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed to prevent further decline.
10. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to discuss further management of the patient's heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) admitted with acute onset dyspnea, fluid overload, and worsening renal function. The patient was intubated for respiratory support and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 167/48 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, and electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is marginal, and the risk of respiratory failure is high. Close monitoring of respiratory function and consideration of extubation are necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload state is likely to worsen due to the presence of CKD and diastolic heart failure. Monitoring of fluid status and consideration of long-term hemodialysis are necessary.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is labile and resistant to treatment. Close monitoring of blood pressure and consideration of additional antihypertensive medications are necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is severe, and the risk of bleeding is high. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of blood transfusions are necessary.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, require close monitoring and correction.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is high due to the presence of anemia and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of stool and nasogastric aspirate output is necessary.
7. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and the risk of acute kidney injury is high. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and consideration of hemodialysis are necessary.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is compromised due to the presence of diastolic heart failure and hypertension. Close monitoring of cardiac function and consideration of additional cardiovascular medications are necessary.
9. Psychiatric complications: The patient's agitation and delirium require close monitoring and consideration of psychiatric consultation.

In conclusion, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload. He was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. The patient is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a recent respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 21. He is autodiuresing without lasix, with a stable creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on PSV, but there is a risk of extubation failure, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased from 2.2-2.9 mg/dL to 4.7 mg/dL, indicating worsening renal function. Autodiuresis may not be sufficient to maintain fluid balance, and there is a risk of AKI.
3. Fluid overload: The patient is in a fluid overload state, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, hypertension, and cardiac failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, which can lead to complications such as cardiac failure, renal failure, and stroke.
5. Delirium: The patient is at risk of delirium due to his age, underlying medical conditions, and the use of sedatives and analgesics.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA infection, and there is a risk of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of right subclavian stenosis, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac failure and arrhythmias.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving tube feeds, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly managed.
9. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are not within normal range, which can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulceration and bleeding due to his age, underlying medical conditions, and the use of sedatives and analgesics."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload state. He was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations on CPAP. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 167/48 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His renal function is worsening, with a creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV, which may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory status. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, requiring mechanical ventilation or even ECMO.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and his blood pressure is still labile. He may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated and stable, and he is autodiuresing. There is a risk of further renal deterioration, requiring dialysis or hemofiltration.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT is falling, and he has a history of anemia. There is a risk of further anemia, requiring transfusions or other interventions.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his NG aspirate appears darker. There is a risk of further bleeding, requiring endoscopy or other interventions.
6. Infection: The patient has a pending blood culture, and his WBC count is elevated. There is a risk of sepsis or infection, requiring antibiotic treatment or other interventions.
7. Agitation: The patient has a history of agitation and delirium, which may be exacerbated by his medical conditions. There is a risk of further agitation, requiring sedation or other interventions.
8. Fluid Overload: The patient is fluid overloaded, which may require further diuresis or hemofiltration.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may require correction to prevent complications.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to his immobility and fluid overload.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's blood pressure and cardiovascular status with medications and fluids as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis or hemofiltration if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with transfusions or other interventions as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider endoscopy or other interventions if necessary.
6. Consider antibiotics if the patient's blood culture is positive.
7. Continue to manage the patient's agitation with sedation or other interventions as needed.
8. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload with diuresis or hemofiltration as needed.
9. Correct the patient's electrolyte imbalance as needed.
10. Monitor the patient for pressure ulcers and take preventative measures as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient currently intubated for
   marginal respiratory status on CPAP and for MRA to r/o RAS
 negative.
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   -try psv today, plan for extubation tomorrow
   - could also consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for
   resistant effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, brady yesterday. metoprolol
   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   off isosorbide, hydralazine; nitro drip
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will continue
   fent and midaz boluses but change to q2h.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD
   -gave lasix yesterday c good effect per renal, however, Cr did continue
   to rise
   -greatly appreciate renal recs
   -pt seems to be autodiuresing this am, will hold off on more lasix but
   plan for TBB of -1Liter, use lasix boluses prn (120IV)
   .
   ## Bradycardia: DDx excessive beta blockade with meds vs. sedation vs.
   increased ICP (note patient has HTN and old strokes)
   -CT head without contrast to evaluate for ICH reassuring
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart
   fent drip and use midaz in boluses
   -will restart bblocker as no bradycardia since yesterday morning

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient currently intubated for
   marginal respiratory status on CPAP and for MRA to r/o RAS
 negative.
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   -try psv today, plan for extubation tomorrow
   - could also consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for
   resistant effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, brady yesterday. metoprolol
   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   off isosorbide, hydralazine; nitro drip
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will continue
   fent and midaz boluses but change to q2h.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD
   -gave lasix yesterday c good effect per renal, however, Cr did continue
   to rise
   -greatly appreciate renal recs
   -pt seems to be autodiuresing this am, will hold off on more lasix but
   plan for TBB of -1Liter, use lasix boluses prn (120IV)
   .
   ## Bradycardia: DDx excessive beta blockade with meds vs. sedation vs.
   increased ICP (note patient has HTN and old strokes)
   -CT head without contrast to evaluate for ICH reassuring
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart
   fent drip and use midaz in boluses
   -will restart bblocker as no bradycardia since yesterday morning

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and was found to be in a fluid overload state, leading to worsening renal function. The patient was intubated for respiratory support and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is marginal, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure is being managed with rate control and afterload reduction, but there is a risk of further worsening if not properly controlled.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is in a fluid overload state, which can lead to further worsening of his renal function and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is anuric, which increases the risk of further kidney damage and the need for hemodialysis.
5. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia could be due to excessive beta blockade with medications, sedation, or increased intracranial pressure, which could lead to cardiac complications if not properly managed.
6. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which could be due to delirium, pain, or other factors, and could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of infection, particularly given his immunocompromised state and the presence of a central line.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting, due to his medications and underlying medical conditions.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of strokes and hypertension increases his risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or increased intracranial pressure.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and heart failure increases his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.    Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.   Respiratory status stable on face mask and nasal cannula.
   CXR shows pulm edema.
   Holding diuresis given renal failure.
   - repeat CXR
   - optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion
   - cardiology consulted
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion shows some improvement as
   evidenced by improvement in renal function.    She has history of MR,
   which is evident on exam and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does
   not support this), and may be a contributing factor to her worsening
   pulmonary edema.
   - Pt has isolated systolic hypertension, which is improving, but
   medically optimizing hypertension and cardiac output could benefit her
   renal function and prolong hemodialysis
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ## Anemia: HCT continues to [**2125**]6.5
 25.2
 23.8 in the setting of
   falling all cell lines (WBC
s and platelets). Today Hct is 24.3,
   stable.
   - NG aspirate guaic negative
   - no BM
 guaic stool, bowel regimen to facilitate this test.
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT this evening
   - IV PPI for possible GIB
   - consult GI if guiac +
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above
   ##. Agitation:
   - geriatric and psychiatric consultation
   - continue Haldol 0.5 po standing,  with ECG monitoring for QT
   prolongation
   - d/c fentanyl, should be used for agitation.
   - may  need to uptitrate haldol with discontinuation of fentanyl
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.
   Creatinine fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today.  She is autodiuresing with UOP
   of 1200cc.   Anticipate renal function should continue to improve with
   improved renal perfusion.   MRA performed confirming no RAS.
   - patient continues to auto-diurese in setting of  improving
   - hold Lasix for now
   - consider long term HD for ultimate fluid control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.    Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.   Respiratory status stable on face mask and nasal cannula.
   CXR shows pulm edema.
   Holding diuresis given renal failure.
   - repeat CXR
   - optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion
   - cardiology consulted
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion shows some improvement as
   evidenced by improvement in renal function.    She has history of MR,
   which is evident on exam and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does
   not support this), and may be a contributing factor to her worsening
   pulmonary edema.
   - Pt has isolated systolic hypertension, which is improving, but
   medically optimizing hypertension and cardiac output could benefit her
   renal function and prolong hemodialysis
   - maintain strict I/O

   stable.
   - NG aspirate guaic negative
   - no BM
 guaic stool, bowel regimen to facilitate this test.
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT this evening
   - IV PPI for possible GIB
   - consult GI if guiac +

   - afterload reduction as documented above
   ##. Agitation:
   - geriatric and psychiatric consultation
   - continue Haldol 0.5 po standing,  with ECG monitoring for QT
   prolongation
   - d/c fentanyl, should be used for agitation.
   - may  need to uptitrate haldol with discontinuation of fentanyl
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.
   Creatinine fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today.  She is autodiuresing with UOP
   of 1200cc.   Anticipate renal function should continue to improve with
   improved renal perfusion.   MRA performed confirming no RAS.
   - patient continues to auto-diurese in setting of  improving

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. She was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on face mask and nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: Believed to be secondary to pulmonary edema, exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
2. Heart failure: With a history of chronic heart failure, acute diastolic heart failure, and possible mitral regurgitation.
3. Oliguria/anuria: Due to acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Pain control: With acute and chronic pain.
5. Altered mental status: Not due to delirium.
6. Pulmonary edema: Confirmed on CXR.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: Due to continued pulmonary edema and high afterload.
2. Decreased cardiac output: Due to worsening heart failure and hypertension.
3. Increased risk of arrhythmias: Due to electrolyte imbalances and medications.
4. Increased risk of bleeding: Due to anticoagulation therapy and platelet dysfunction.
5. Increased risk of infection: Due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines.
6. Decreased renal function: Due to continued oliguria/anuria and potential nephrotoxicity.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: Due to diuresis and medications.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Due to anticoagulation therapy and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Repeat CXR to monitor pulmonary edema.
2. Optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion.
3. Consult cardiology to further evaluate and manage heart failure.
4. Continue diuresis and monitor renal function.
5. Maintain strict input/output balance to ensure patient remains euvolemic.
6. Monitor for signs of bleeding and infection.
7. Continue pain control and management of altered mental status.
8. Consider long-term hemodialysis for ultimate fluid control.

The patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition, treatment plan, and potential complications. The patient's son has been informed of the patient's condition and is available for communication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.   Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated

   off.   Improving end organ perfusion as evidenced by improvement in
   renal function.
   - re-adjust BP medications, titrate to improve afterload reduction
   potentially add lobetalol, and hydralazine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted with acute onset dyspnea, fluid overload, and worsening renal function. The patient was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. She was extubated yesterday with spontaneous ABG values of 7.34/53/122/30. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 148/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory status is stable on CPAP/PSV mode.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to chronic heart failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable at 24.3%, but there is a risk of further anemia due to falling all cell lines (WBC and platelets).
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and her blood pressure is labile, ranging from 120 to 180 mmHg systolic. There is a risk of hypertension exacerbation due to agitation and delirium.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further worsening of renal function due to fluid overload and decreased renal perfusion.
5. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk of fluid overload due to her underlying CKD and fluid overload at admission.
6. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, and there is a risk of inadequate pain control.
7. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to delirium and sedation.
8. Pulmonary edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, and there is a risk of further worsening due to chronic heart failure and fluid overload.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT.
3. Continue to adjust the patient's hypertension medications to improve afterload reduction.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider long-term hemodialysis for ultimate fluid control.
5. Continue to manage the patient's pain and consider adding IV PPI for possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's altered mental status and consider geriatric and psychiatric consultation.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and consider fluid restriction and diuretic therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and consider adding IV PPI for possible gastrointestinal bleeding."

   24 Hour Events:
   -renal stopped by:  said HD not the best idea for now; instead better
   to manage her BP and volume status; okay with increasing labetalol and
   w/ continued clonidine patch
   -cardiology recs:  treat BP with imdur 60 [**Hospital1 **], hydral 10 mg q6 hrs, can
   continue amlodipine, and can uptitrate labetolol to get HR 50s-60s.
   Will also probably benefit from lasix long term.  Suggest trying to
   wean off clonidine
   -Around 1800, got 10 mg IV hydral for BP > 180; went into afib
   following this, with HRs in 130s-150s; pt reported palpitations but
   otherwise asymptomatic.  K+ low at 3.4.  Blood gas okay. Got one-time
   dose of lopressor; labetolol was uptitrated to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> TID.
   Returned to sinus rhythm within ~1 hr of flipping into afib with HRs
   back in the 80s. Throughout night had multiple reversions to afib with
   HRs in 130s-140s: esmolol drip started with bolus of 250 mcg/kg then
   running at 150 mcg/kg/min given persistence of tachycardia; HRs
   improved to 60s-70s, BP in the 150s, satting in mid 80s.  ABG at 5 AM
   showed pO2: 55  pCO2: 41 pH:7.38 HCO3 25.
   -Cards notified about new onset afib; consider anticoagulation. They
   suggest searching for other sources of hypertension (pheo, thyroid).

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).  Currently on labetalol 100
   TID and on esmolol drip running at 150 mcg/hr with HRs back in sinus
   and BPs in the 150s systolic.
   -Obtain 2D echo to evaluate for worsening of systolic function; per
   echo in early [**2126-7-23**], had mild LVH, normal systolic function, no
   valvular disease
   -Optimize BP control with labetalol + can add Imdur 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] per cards
   recs
   -Rate control with labetalol and esmolol
   -Per CHADS2: she scores 4:  should be started on coumadin.  INR is
   currently 1.3.    Currently in sinus but if reverts back to atrial
   fibrillation, consider starting anticoagulation.
   .
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.  CXR shows florid pulm edema. Received lasix
   120 mg IV X 1 yesterday with diuresis of ~.8 L.   Creatinine improved
   from 4.1 to 3.9.   Got another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat
   creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - not diuresing much with lasix boluses; consider adding metolazone to
   lasix;  slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might
   be room for further diuresis
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving end organ
   perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement in renal
   function.    She has history of MR, which is evident on exam and prior
   ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and may be a
   contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Given that could be secondary to MR, need to continue afterload
   reduction.  On amlodipine, hydral only being given if SBP > 180, also
   on labetalol and esmolol drip.   Further diuresis with lasix +
   metolazone may prove useful.  Can put on standing hydralazine.  Should
   repeat echo to evaluate mitral valve function.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180

   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  EKG being repeated this AM to look for QT
   prolongation.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -renal stopped by:  said HD not the best idea for now; instead better
   to manage her BP and volume status; okay with increasing labetalol and
   w/ continued clonidine patch
   -cardiology recs:  treat BP with imdur 60 [**Hospital1 **], hydral 10 mg q6 hrs, can
   continue amlodipine, and can uptitrate labetolol to get HR 50s-60s.
   Will also probably benefit from lasix long term.  Suggest trying to
   wean off clonidine
   -Around 1800, got 10 mg IV hydral for BP > 180; went into afib
   following this, with HRs in 130s-150s; pt reported palpitations but
   otherwise asymptomatic.  K+ low at 3.4.  Blood gas okay. Got one-time
   dose of lopressor; labetolol was uptitrated to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> TID.
   Returned to sinus rhythm within ~1 hr of flipping into afib with HRs
   back in the 80s. Throughout night had multiple reversions to afib with
   HRs in 130s-140s: esmolol drip started with bolus of 250 mcg/kg then
   running at 150 mcg/kg/min given persistence of tachycardia; HRs
   improved to 60s-70s, BP in the 150s, satting in mid 80s.  ABG at 5 AM
   showed pO2: 55  pCO2: 41 pH:7.38 HCO3 25.
   -Cards notified about new onset afib; consider anticoagulation. They
   suggest searching for other sources of hypertension (pheo, thyroid).

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening renal function and fluid overload.

The patient's condition is complex and multi-faceted, with several potential medical complications that need to be addressed. The key issues include:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has developed new-onset AFib, which is unclear in etiology. The possibility of worsening afterload, hypertension, hypoxia, or valvular dysfunction as triggers needs to be considered.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has florid pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, which is likely secondary to chronic heart failure exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has CKD with a baseline creatinine of 2.2-2.9, which has worsened to 4.0 during the current admission. The etiology of the CKD is unclear, but may be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from prolonged renal ischemia.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension with labile blood pressures, which can be exacerbated by agitation and delirium.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is stable, but the patient may require transfusions to improve oxygen delivery.
6. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be related to underlying medical conditions or medications. Sedation with haloperidol has been initiated.
7. Fluid overload: The patient is experiencing fluid overload, which needs to be managed with diuresis and fluid restriction.

The patient's current medications include labetalol, amlodipine, clonidine, and hydralazine. The patient is also receiving esmolol drip for rate control and anticoagulation with subcutaneous heparin.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Optimization of blood pressure control with labetalol and addition of imdur 60 mg as recommended by cardiology.
2. Rate control with labetalol and esmolol drip.
3. Diuresis with lasix and metolazone to improve renal function and reduce fluid overload.
4. Afterload reduction with amlodipine and hydralazine to improve cardiac function and reduce pulmonary edema.
5. Repeat echocardiogram to evaluate mitral valve function and assess for any signs of worsening systolic function.
6. Maintenance of strict input/output (I/O) balance to ensure patient remains euvoicemic.
7. Daily weights and low sodium diet to monitor fluid status.
8. Consideration of further diuresis and optimization of renal perfusion with afterload reduction and renally dosed medications.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR shows improving pulmonary edema. Received
   500mg diuril IV followed by lasix 120 mg IV.  Diuresis of 1400cc over
   36 hrs.     Creatinine improving from ed from 4.0  to 3.9.   Got
   another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - ECHO - shows mild LVH, normal systolic function, 2+ mitral regurg
   - slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might be
   room for further diuresis
   - optimize volume status with slower diuresis, goal
 500cc /day
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replaceme.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).
   - Rate control with labetalol 100 TID, addition of metoprolol 25mg tid,
   titrating esmolol down as HR has normalized.
   - start heparin w/o bolus for anticoagulation, will discuss with family
   regarding long term anticoagulation
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   -  Discontinue amlodipine,
   - Continue labetolol, lasix, started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol
   25tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increase hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   - f/u retic count
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR shows improving pulmonary edema. Received
   500mg diuril IV followed by lasix 120 mg IV.  Diuresis of 1400cc over
   36 hrs.     Creatinine improving from ed from 4.0  to 3.9.   Got
   another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - ECHO - shows mild LVH, normal systolic function, 2+ mitral regurg

   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of

   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).
   - Rate control with labetalol 100 TID, addition of metoprolol 25mg tid,

   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   -  Discontinue amlodipine,
   - Continue labetolol, lasix, started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol
   25tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, DM-II, right subclavian stenosis, and CKD, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by CVA. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure, acute oliguria/anuria, and atrial fibrillation. Her medical history includes heart failure, chronic mitral regurgitation, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, likely secondary to chronic mitral regurgitation and worsening renal function
* Atrial fibrillation, likely triggered by hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, and worsening valvular dysfunction
* Oliguria/anuria, likely secondary to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
* Heart failure, with symptoms of SOB and fluid overload
* Chronic kidney disease, with a baseline creatinine of 2.2-2.9 and current creatinine of 4.0

The patient has undergone several interventions, including:

* Placement of a PICC line for central venous access
* Echocardiogram showing mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
* Transesophageal echocardiogram showing mild left ventricular hypertrophy, normal systolic function, and 2+ mitral regurgitation
* Administration of diuretics, including IV Diuril and Lasix, with a goal of diuresis of 500cc/day
* Administration of anticoagulation therapy with heparin
* Management of atrial fibrillation with rate control using labetalol, metoprolol, and esmolol

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progressive worsening of respiratory failure and pulmonary edema
* Further decline in renal function and development of acute kidney injury
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Development of atrial fibrillation-related complications, such as stroke or thromboembolism
* Worsening of heart failure symptoms and decreased cardiac output
* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and devices.

The patient's family has been informed of her worsening condition and has been advised to prepare for the possibility of long-term ventilation and potential decline in her condition. The patient's code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR shows improving pulmonary edema. Received
   500mg diuril IV followed by lasix 120 mg IV.  Diuresis of 1400cc over
   36 hrs.     Creatinine improving from ed from 4.0  to 3.9.   Got
   another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - optimize volume status with aggressive diuresis - continue  lasix
   boluses in addition to metolazone
   - ECHO - [**Last Name (un) 1830**] mild LVH, normal systolic function, 2+ mitral regurg
   - slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might be
   room for further diuresis
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replaceme.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).
   - Rate control with labetalol 100 TID, titrating esmolol down as HR has
   normalized.
   - should start anticoagulation today (CHADS2 = 4)
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Given that could be secondary to MROn amlodipine, hydral only being
   given if SBP > 180, also on labetalol.  Further diuresis with lasix +
   diuril.  Started Imdur 20mg [**Hospital1 **], reduced clonidine to 0.1mg/24h from
   0.2mg/24hr.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   - ask cards re: management
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   - f/u retic count
   ##. Agitation:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with worsening respiratory status, oliguria/anuria, and atrial fibrillation. Her condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, mitral regurgitation, and chronic heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 178/53 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on high-flow nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but her cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting cardiac injury.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray (CXR), show a large pleural effusion on the right side and cephalization consistent with pulmonary edema.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, pain control, and altered mental status. Her treatment plan includes aggressive diuresis with lasix and diuril, rate control with labetalol, and anticoagulation with warfarin. She is also receiving analgesia and sedation as needed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require more aggressive respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may require further diuresis and nephrology consultation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and hypoxia.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly if she develops a gastrointestinal bleed or other bleeding complications.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of thrombosis, particularly if she develops a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs

   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).

   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -Given difficult to control, consider cardioversion, talk w/ cards,
   although getting outside of window of opportunity to cardiovert w/o
   anticoagulation
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.

   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of hypoxic respiratory failure and worsening renal function.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 168/49 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 95%. Her respiratory support includes a high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is believed to be secondary to hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, and worsening valvular dysfunction. She is receiving rate control medications, including labetalol and metoprolol, and is being titrated off esmolol drip.

The patient's laboratory results show stable creatinine levels, with a current value of 3.9 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her hemoglobin and hematocrit values are stable.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's current creatinine level is 3.9 mg/dL, which is higher than her baseline value. Further decline in renal function may occur if not adequately managed.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and cardioversion may be necessary to restore sinus rhythm.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still labile, and afterload reduction may be necessary to prevent further exacerbation of hypertension.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is improving, but further episodes may occur if not adequately managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but further decline in hemoglobin levels may occur if not adequately managed.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state and the use of invasive lines and devices.
7. Delirium: The patient has a history of agitation and delirium, and further episodes may occur if not adequately managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to assess for worsening renal function, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to optimize her condition, including rate control medications for atrial fibrillation and afterload reduction medications for hypertension.
3. Continue to optimize diuresis and fluid management to prevent further pulmonary edema.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Consider cardioversion for the patient's atrial fibrillation if it is not well-controlled.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her medications as necessary to prevent further decline in hemoglobin levels.
7. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection in the patient's immunocompromised state.
8. Consider sedation to manage the patient's agitation and delirium."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -f/u cards recs, look back to see if hx of afib, ablation candidate?
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation. Her condition is complicated by chronic mitral regurgitation, pulmonary edema, and worsening renal function.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 168/49 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95%. She is receiving oxygen therapy via a high-flow neb device.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 382 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 3.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mmol/L
* Sodium: 138 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.0 mmol/L
* Chloride: 96 mmol/L
* Calcium: 9.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.2 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* LDH: 180 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure
* Atrial fibrillation
* Chronic mitral regurgitation
* Pulmonary edema
* Worsening renal function
* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Anemia
* Agitation
* Hypertension
* Chronic kidney disease

Potential medical complications:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation
* Development of ventricular fibrillation
* Progression of pulmonary edema
* Further deterioration of renal function
* Development of acute kidney injury
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged hospitalization
* Development of electrolyte imbalances
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results
* Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to optimize her condition
* Continue to provide oxygen therapy and respiratory support as needed

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -f/u cards recs, look back to see if hx of afib, ablation candidate?
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, DM-II, right subclavian stenosis, and CKD, who has been admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm (sinus tachycardia)
* Blood pressure: 176/78 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 95%

The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory failure, with a diagnosis of hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and chronic mitral regurgitation. She has been treated with hydralazine, labetalol, and metoprolol to reduce afterload and improve end-organ perfusion.

The patient has also developed atrial fibrillation, which is believed to be related to hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, and worsening valvular dysfunction. She has been treated with labetalol, metoprolol, and esmolol to control her heart rate.

The patient's renal function has improved slightly, with a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL. However, she remains at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying CKD and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has also been experiencing agitation, which has been managed with Haldol. She has been prescribed subcutaneous heparin and PPI for prophylaxis.

The patient's goals of care are to avoid long-term ventilation without foreseeable improvement, and to reassess and discuss options with her son on Thursday.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration of her condition and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial fibrillation, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure, which may lead to further deterioration of her renal function and potential need for dialysis.
4. Agitation, which may lead to further complications, such as falls or injuries.
5. Infection, which may lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications, and to improve her overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Yesterday D/C
d labetalol, esmolol drip. Pressures this AM
   are 170/70; needs much improved systolic control.  Can push up
   hydralazine (currently on 25 q8) -> can go to 50 mg q8.  Reducing
   afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and improving
   her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.  Could
   consider switching from metoprolol to labetalol, since labetalol will
   provide better BP control.   Further diuresis only important for
   afterload reduction rather than taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily
   without any lasix, so would not aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 50 mg q8
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   - Currently on metoprolol 100 mg, can consider switch to labetalol at
   higher dose (max dose of labetalol is 1600 mg/day!); continue
   amiodarone to maintain sinus.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120

   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.

   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA

   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Yesterday D/C
d labetalol, esmolol drip. Pressures this AM
   are 170/70; needs much improved systolic control.  Can push up
   hydralazine (currently on 25 q8) -> can go to 50 mg q8.  Reducing
   afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and improving
   her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.  Could
   consider switching from metoprolol to labetalol, since labetalol will
   provide better BP control.   Further diuresis only important for
   afterload reduction rather than taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily
   without any lasix, so would not aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 50 mg q8
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   - Currently on metoprolol 100 mg, can consider switch to labetalol at
   higher dose (max dose of labetalol is 1600 mg/day!); continue
   amiodarone to maintain sinus.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; check afternoon HCT, especially since
   started on heparin IV yesterday.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving
   any fluids.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be caused by anxiety, hypothyroidism, or other secondary causes. If not addressed, it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of stroke.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is labile and may exacerbate cardiac problems, kidney damage, and other complications. Aggressive management of blood pressure is crucial to prevent these complications.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and further diuresis may be necessary to improve renal function. However, this must be done cautiously to avoid exacerbating the situation.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is slightly decreased, which may worsen if not addressed. Further evaluation and management are necessary to optimize red blood cell production.
6. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be caused by anxiety, pain, or other factors. Aggressive management of agitation is crucial to prevent further complications, such as falls, injuries, or respiratory distress.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to prolonged hospitalization, catheters, and other medical interventions. Prophylactic measures, such as antibiotics and antifungals, should be considered.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac condition, including hypertension, tachycardia, and possible cardiac arrhythmias, increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiac condition and possible hypothyroidism may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, cognitive impairment, or stroke.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed aggressively to address the underlying causes of their medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus tachycardia on the
   monitor.  Repeat 12 lead ECG.  On lopressor and amiodarone.  On IV
   heparin, PTT 150, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT at noon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain except at IV site when potassium given.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 PULMONARY EDEMA:  As above.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr staying around 4.0. Repeat urine
   lytes.  Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as
   above.
 ANEMA:  Hct slightly decreased, will check pm hct given she has been
   started on heparin. Guaiac all stools.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus tachycardia on the
   monitor.  Repeat 12 lead ECG.  On lopressor and amiodarone.  On IV
   heparin, PTT 150, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT at noon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain except at IV site when potassium given.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 PULMONARY EDEMA:  As above.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr staying around 4.0. Repeat urine
   lytes.  Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as
   above.
 ANEMA:  Hct slightly decreased, will check pm hct given she has been
   started on heparin. Guaiac all stools.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of diastolic dysfunction, CHF, Afib, acute on chronic renal failure, and tenuous respiratory status. She is currently in the ICU and is being treated with various medications, including amiodarone, heparin, and hydralazine. Her vital signs are stable, but her respiratory status is still tenuous. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is on a high-flow nebulizer. Her blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, and her urine output is decreased.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still tenuous, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's Afib may convert to a more serious arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is at risk of developing further renal failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate sepsis.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is slightly decreased, and she may develop further anemia.
7. GI bleeding: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate GI bleeding.
8. Infection: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate an infection.
9. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's Afib may lead to cardiac tamponade.
10. Cardiac arrest: The patient's Afib may lead to cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication as necessary.
4. Consider performing a echocardiogram to assess the patient's cardiac function.
5. Consider performing a CT scan to assess the patient's pulmonary edema.
6. Consider performing a GI series to assess the patient's GI tract.
7. Consider performing a blood culture to assess for infection.
8. Consider performing a cardiac enzymes test to assess for cardiac damage.
9. Consider performing a troponin test to assess for cardiac damage.
10. Consider performing a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function."

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving
   any fluids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .

   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving

   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving

   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 61 beats per minute, blood pressure 177/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 91%. Her laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and her medications include hydralazine, metoprolol, isosorbide, and amiodarone. She has also received IV heparin for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory failure may be exacerbated by pulmonary edema, which could worsen her condition.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest AKI, which could further compromise her renal function.
3. Heart failure: The patient's history of heart failure and chronic mitral regurgitation may contribute to her current condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be exacerbated by phlebotomy and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be a symptom of underlying anxiety or other conditions and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Infection: The patient's history of CVA and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing an infection, which could worsen her condition.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may require further evaluation and treatment to prevent complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess the progression of her condition.
2. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's anemia, including blood transfusions and iron supplementation.
3. Continue to optimize the patient's renal function with afterload reduction and diuresis as needed.
4. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's agitation, including anxiety management and sedation as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as needed to prevent complications.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's potential infections, including antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed to prevent complications."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
   Assessment/Plan:
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2123**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2126-8-24**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   .
   (#) Hypoxia: improving; patient already down to 6LNC in the ICU.
   Evidence of volume overload on CXR.  Patient also had emesis and,
   though he is not at especially high risk, may have had an aspiration
   event.  He has not gotten an extra large amount of volume aside from
   the 4 units total of FFP.  He has now received lasix 20, then 40 mg IV
   though is urine output is only 20 cc over the last three to four
   hours.  (Of note, he did have 300 cc urine recorded in flow sheet at 11
   pm last night.)  Despite to putting out urine, the patient does report
   feeling better.  Low suspicion for PE or other pathology.
   -- cont to wean oxygen and diurese as tolerated
   -- aspiration precautions if he continues to vomit
   -- antiemetics PRN
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE UGIB: Pt had episode of guaiaic positive emesis in context
   of severe cough and post-tussive emesis.  Has been nauseaus since
   admission likely from RP bleed.  Pt has no h/o ETOH abuse, liver
   disease which would be concerning for ascities.  no known ulcer
   disease; denies upper bleed such as epistaxis and dental bleeding.
   - NPO; IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain active T&S
   - Maintain Hct > 25 given large degree of drop from baseline (though
   possibly hemoconcentrated on admission)
   - possible GI c/s re: UGI
   .
   (#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Differential diagnosis broad at this point.
   No recent trauma. Causes of RP bleed could include: renal maignancy,
   pyelonephritis +/- abscess, vascular disease, rupture of renal cyst.
   Subcapsular and intraparenchymal bleed makes intrinsic kidney etiology
   most likely. Exophytic lesion on upper pole noted on CT (12->22mm since
   [**2123**]) but unrelated to current bleed. Bleed most likely exacerbated by
   warfarin (although not supratherapeutic INR ~2.5) and daily baby
   aspirin (functional platelet abnormalities).  Urology is following.
   Decreased urine output is concerning for progression of bleed affecting
   renal perfusion, and Cr has bumped from 2.3 --> 4.5 overnight.
   -- will call urology this am to touch base about the decreased urine
   output
   -- will give another 2 units FFP given possible progression of bleed
   -- cont holding warfarin, aspirin
   -- would lke to give RBC transfusion, but will hold given volume
   .
   (#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: unclear what his baseline is (seems
   to be in mid 2's); acute change with minimal UOP in last few hours is
   concerning for progression of the hematoma compromising blood flow to
   the kidney or IVC; also has a mildly elevated lactate.
   -- will repeat pelvis CT scan
   -Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO DAILY
   -- renal diet when restarted
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE AMI: ST changes on EKG ordered for eval of nausea (not CP,
   albeit pt is diabetic) were considered ""artifact"" by cards fellow and
   normalized on repeat EKG.
   -- CE ordered with am labs though low suspicion will be positive
   -- cont statin; hold ASA given bleed
   .
   (#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  WBC currently 13.6 with left shift. Infection
   is highest on differential, although stress reaction to acute bleed,
   inflammatory, and neoplastic disease are also possible. No evidence fo
   PNA currently (though may have had an aspirtaion event last night).
   -- continue to monitor
   -- Check urine culture, blood culture
   .
   # CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2123**] echo): Pt
   reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain. Known systolic
   dysfunction although LVEF in [**2123**] >55%.
   -Strict I's and O's
   -monitor respiratory status, vital signs
   -- might consider repeat echo
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2121**]
   (defibrillated 1x).
   -holding coumadin
   -continue telemetry
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 319**]
   [**2125**].
   -HISS
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 851**] [**Location (un) 684**] of [**Last Name (un) 294**] folows his DM, as pt is on a study drug for
   kidney disease
   .
   #HTN: Currently stable though on low side with possible IVC compression
   from hematoma.  Will be cautious with antihypertensives in setting of
   bleed.
   - furosemide according to BP parameters
   -hold metoprolol and valsartan, reasses if needed
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a complex medical history, including coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker/defibrillator, systolic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute onset of right-sided flank pain, hypoxia, and possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), myocardial infarction (MI), and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and his oxygen saturation is 91% on high-flow nebulization.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is 177/67 mmHg, and his heart rate is 61 bpm.
3. Renal failure: The patient has oliguria/anuria, and his creatinine has increased from 2.3 to 4.5 mg/dL overnight.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had guaiac-positive emesis, and he is at risk for UGIB.
5. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and his cardiac silhouette is enlarged on chest X-ray.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed, and his hematocrit has decreased from 25.7 to 23.3% since admission.
7. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is 13.6, and he has a left shift.
8. Possible sepsis: The patient's lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L, and he has a mildly elevated creatine kinase (CK) level.
9. Potential complications: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and septic shock.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to ARDS or respiratory failure.
2. Progression of renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and his urine output is decreasing, which may lead to further kidney damage.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhagic shock.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and cardiac silhouette enlargement may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to septic shock.
6. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level and mildly elevated CK level suggest possible sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and cardiac silhouette enlargement may increase his risk for PE.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 ANXIETY:  Still think this is a sigificant component of anxiety,
   possible sundowning contributing to decompensations at night.  Consider
   Geriatrics consult to help guide us on this.
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA:  Gently IVF hydration overnight.  Given urine
   electrolytes with Na < 10, this is likely prerenal.  Gentle hydration
   as she still has poor po intake.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus bradycardia.
   Discontinue amiodarone as per cardiology.   Hold on starting diltiazem
   for now. On IV heparin, PTT 104, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT
   this afternoon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 PULMONARY EDEMA: Increased Fi02 requirements in setting of anxiety,
   hypertension.  Likely related to exacerbation of her underlying
   diastolic dysfunction.  CXR not significantly changed.  Had increased
   hydralazine dosing yesterday, continue 75 QID.  Will continue to
   monitor in ICU given labile blood pressures and escalating Fi02
   requirements.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr stable 3.8. Repeat urine lytes.
   Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as above.

 ANEMA:  More than adequate bump to transfusion 1 u pRBCs yesterday.
   Spuriously low.  Guaiac all stools on heparin.  Check daily hct.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   have tenuous respiratory status.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 PULMONARY EDEMA: Increased Fi02 requirements in setting of anxiety,
   hypertension.  Likely related to exacerbation of her underlying
   diastolic dysfunction.  CXR not significantly changed.  Had increased
   hydralazine dosing yesterday, continue 75 QID.  Will continue to
   monitor in ICU given labile blood pressures and escalating Fi02
   requirements.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr stable 3.8. Repeat urine lytes.
   Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as above.

 ANEMA:  More than adequate bump to transfusion 1 u pRBCs yesterday.
   Spuriously low.  Guaiac all stools on heparin.  Check daily hct.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.1 g/dL, which is anemia. The patient received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) yesterday.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is 3.8 mg/dL, indicating AKI. The patient's urine output is oliguric/anuric, and the urine electrolytes show a sodium level less than 10, suggesting prerenal AKI.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, with pulmonary edema in the setting of significant mitral regurgitation (MR), diastolic dysfunction, and suboptimal afterload reduction.
4. Cardiac Status: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB), which is now being treated with IV heparin. The patient's cardiac output is compromised due to diastolic dysfunction and MR.
5. Neurological Status: The patient is anxious and has altered mental status, possibly due to sundowning. The patient is receiving haloperidol (Haldol) for anxiety and agitation.
6. Hemodynamic Status: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and the patient requires increasing FiO2 requirements.
7. Fluid Balance: The patient has a fluid balance of 464 mL, with 824 mL of IV fluids administered and 735 mL of urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Further decline in cardiac function due to diastolic dysfunction and MR.
2. Worsening of respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and decreased lung compliance.
3. Progression of AKI to acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
5. Development of delirium or coma due to altered mental status and decreased cerebral perfusion.
6. Increased risk of infection due to compromised immune function and prolonged hospitalization.
7. Worsening of anemia due to ongoing blood loss and decreased red blood cell production.

The patient's care plan should focus on optimizing cardiac output, managing respiratory failure, and addressing AKI. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding and infection. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and the patient should be reassessed for delirium or coma."

   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema,
   fluid overload poor renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by elevated [**Doctor Last Name **] and worsening renal function.  Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Cr stable to 4.0 and patient appears clinically dry.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID, ISMN 30 [**Hospital1 **], Clonodine patch,
   Hydralazine 25 QID
   - consider adding low dose a-1 blocker
   - consider bronchoscopy for evaluation of worsening RL fields with
   possible collapse
   - hold on lasix as patient is negative for LOS and clinically dry
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son concerning anticoagulation - consider
   DC heparin drip as patient is now in sinus
 patient was in
   intermittent AF with RVR x 4 days which is minimal RF for clot
   formation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. He was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled hypertension. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress associated with anxiety and elevated blood pressure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 50 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 168/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.6-10.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8-10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 375-477 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.8-4.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24-26.5 mg/dL
* Serum potassium: 3.6-4.0 mEq/L
* Serum magnesium: 1.9-2.2 mg/dL
* Serum phosphorus: 4.8-5.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* LDH: 180 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.0-10.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.07 ng/mL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): worsening opacity in the right lung field, consistent with increased pleural effusion and atelectasis, with reduced aeration of the right upper lobe.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and exacerbation of resistant hypertension
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) likely due to mitral regurgitation (MR) and decompensated heart failure
* Acute on chronic renal failure with stable creatinine and decreased urine output
* Agitation and delirium

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control and consideration of adding a beta-blocker
* Hold lasix due to negative fluid balance and clinically dry status
* Consider bronchoscopy for evaluation of worsening right lung fields with possible collapse
* Continue anticoagulation with heparin drip, but consider discontinuing it as the patient is now in sinus rhythm
* Follow geriatrics recommendations for management of delirium and attempt to normalize sleep-wake cycle
* Continue to check electrolytes and replete as needed
* Consider switching to remeron in setting of poor oral intake and continued agitation

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of respiratory failure due to increased pleural effusion and atelectasis
* Development of acute kidney injury due to decreased urine output and stable creatinine
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Development of delirium and agitation due to underlying medical conditions and medications
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to underlying heart disease and medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted with right subclavian stenosis, resistant hypertension, and poorly controlled hypertension. He presents with dyspnea, fluid overload, and respiratory distress associated with anxiety and elevated blood pressure. The patient has been placed back on BiPAP for persistent hypoxia and worsening CXR. He has a history of delirium and is currently experiencing agitation and labile hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening CXR and decreasing UOP suggest ongoing respiratory failure, which may lead to further decompensation and potential need for intubation.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) may lead to further cardiac decompensation, and the patient's labile hypertension may exacerbate cardiac issues.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may lead to further worsening of renal function, and the patient's decreasing UOP suggests ongoing fluid overload.
4. Delirium: The patient's ongoing delirium may lead to further agitation, labile hypertension, and potential need for increased sedation.
5. Infection: The patient's ongoing use of antibiotics and the presence of a PICC line may increase the risk of infection.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of resistant hypertension and ongoing labile hypertension may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue BiPAP to manage respiratory distress and hypoxia.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, and consider adjusting medication to manage atrial fibrillation with RVR.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with medications, and consider adding additional agents as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, and consider adjusting diuretic therapy as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with sedation and other therapies as needed.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of infection, and consider adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Consider transitioning the patient to a medical ICU once stable, and continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. He was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled hypertension. The patient continues to experience respiratory distress associated with anxiety and elevated blood pressure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema exacerbated by elevated blood pressure and worsening renal function.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response likely resulting from mitral regurgitation and decompensated heart failure.
3. Hypertension with labile pressures ranging from 120 to 240 systolic, often exacerbated by agitation and delirium.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure with stable creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
5. Agitation, which is being managed with sedation and antipsychotics.
6. Delirium, which is being managed with geriatric recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Hypertensive emergencies, including hypertensive encephalopathy, which can lead to cerebral edema and brain damage.
4. Renal failure, which can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
5. Sepsis, which can arise from the patient's underlying medical conditions and infections.
6. Pneumonia, which can arise from the patient's respiratory failure and underlying medical conditions.

To manage these potential complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate.
2. Adjust the patient's anti-hypertensive medications as needed to manage his labile blood pressure.
3. Continue to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his anti-arrhythmic medications as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's agitation and delirium with sedation and antipsychotics.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
7. Consider initiating antibiotic therapy if the patient develops signs of sepsis.
8. Consider initiating antiviral therapy if the patient develops signs of pneumonia.

Overall, the patient's care team should continue to provide close monitoring and management to address his complex medical conditions and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes, and right subclavian stenosis, who was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. She has been maximally afterload-reduced, fluid-negative, and continues to have issues with pulmonary edema and respiratory support. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 215/64 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is currently in sinus rhythm. She is also experiencing agitation and delirium, and has been prescribed seroquel to regulate her sleep-wake cycle.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and poor renal function increase her risk of hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's poor renal function and continued fluid overload increase her risk of acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Agitation and Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium increase her risk of falls, injuries, and respiratory complications.
5. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's labile hypertension increases her risk of hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiac arrest, stroke, and other complications.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's continued pulmonary edema increases her risk of respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and labile hypertension increases her risk of cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue current treatment plan for hypertension, including hydralazine and metoprolol.
2. Continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort.
3. Defer additional diuresis, as pulmonary edema is likely due to the patient's physiology and not fluid status.
4. Consider adding additional nodal agents, such as calcium channel blockers or digoxin, to control heart rate.
5. Clarify goals of care with the patient's son and address the issue of anticoagulation needs.
6. Continue seroquel to regulate the patient's sleep-wake cycle.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a medical-surgical unit once stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. The patient continues to experience pulmonary edema and respiratory support.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further decline in oxygenation and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure can worsen, leading to further decline in kidney function and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and indwelling lines can increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium can worsen, leading to further agitation, hypertension, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's labile hypertension can worsen, leading to hypertensive crisis, which can cause end-organ damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload can worsen, leading to further pulmonary edema and potentially life-threatening complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing current hypertension regimen with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200.
2. Continuing BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort.
3. Deferring additional diuresis as pulmonary edema is likely due to the patient's physiology and not fluid status.
4. Continuing metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, and considering adding additional nodal agents like CCB or Digoxin if necessary.
5. Clarifying goals of care with the patient's son and addressing the issue of anticoagulation needs.
6. Continuing anti-HTN regimen as discussed above.
7. Following Geriatrics recommendations for sleep-wake cycle regulation.
8. Continuing Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep-wake cycle.
9. Continuing to follow ICU care protocols for nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and code status.

The patient's disposition is pending a meeting regarding goals of care today, and she will require transfer to a medical-surgical unit (MACU) once stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. The patient continues to experience pulmonary edema and respiratory support.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and worsening renal function
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely caused by mitral regurgitation and decompensated heart failure
* Resistant hypertension with labile pressures ranging from 120-240 mmHg systolic, often exacerbated by agitation and delirium
* Acute on chronic renal failure with improving creatinine levels and sufficient urine output
* Agitation and delirium with abnormal sleep-wake cycles, exacerbating hypertension

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening pulmonary edema and respiratory failure, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
2. Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
3. Sepsis or septic shock, potentially caused by pneumonia or other infections
4. Acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances
5. Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, due to hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or other underlying conditions
6. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections, potentially caused by prolonged respiratory support
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, due to stress, hypertension, or anticoagulation therapy

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Continued respiratory support with BiPAP
* Anti-hypertensive medications, including hydralazine and metoprolol
* Diuretic therapy to manage pulmonary edema
* Sedation with Seroquel to regulate sleep-wake cycles and reduce agitation
* Anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
* Prophylaxis with PPI to prevent stress ulcers

The patient's goals of care are pending, and a family meeting is scheduled to discuss the patient's wishes regarding code status, including do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) orders. The patient's disposition is pending, but it is likely that she will require transfer to a medical intensive care unit (MICU) once stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema,
   fluid overload poor renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by elevated [**Doctor Last Name **] and worsening renal function.  Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Cr stable to 4.0 and patient appears clinically dry.
   - continue current anti-HTn regimine
 this is systolic HTN and patient
   is maximally afterload reduced as evidenced by low diastolic BP and it
   is unlikely we can improve on this
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer diuresis as pulmonary edema is do to abnormal physiology and
   likely note fluid overload
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son
 issue of anticoagulation needs to be
   addressed
   - f.u metanephrines for consideration of pheo
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have stable Cr
   with now decr. UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   nearly 6L negative for [**Location 4982**] keep patient even today
   ##. Agitation:  continue Seroquel 25 qHS with 12.5 q 6 PRN for
   agitation.  Consider switching to Remeron in setting of poor PO intake
   and continued agitation.  DC HALDOL.  And NO PRN ATIVAN.
   - continue to follow geriatrics recommendations concerning management
   of delirium
 attempting to normalize sleep wake cycle
   - recommendations are very much valued and appreciated
   ##. Goals of care
 contact family today for clarification, we are not
   sure what more we have to offer and do not feel we will be able to fix
   the pulmonary edema.  This needs to be made clear to the son.
   ##. FEN: continue to check lytes and replete PRN
    ##. Prophylaxis: On PPI, IV heparin.
   ##. Access: aline, peripherals, PICC.
   ##. Code: Full
   ##. Communication: son  [**Name (NI) 738**] [**Name (NI) 739**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8441**]) - Health Care Proxy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, and acute kidney injury. She is currently in the ICU with worsening renal function, fluid overload, and delirium. She has been treated with various medications, including hydralazine, lasix, and morphine, but continues to experience hypertension, dyspnea, and agitation. Her lab results show elevated blood pressure, potassium, and lactate levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and worsening renal function may lead to hypoxic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of stroke.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's worsening renal function may lead to acute kidney injury, which can be life-threatening.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to worsening pulmonary edema, hypertension, and cardiac dysfunction.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen her agitation, confusion, and disorientation, leading to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and stroke.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
8. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase her risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.

Recommendations:

1. Continue current anti-HTN regimen and monitor blood pressure closely.
2. Continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort.
3. Defer diuresis as pulmonary edema is likely due to abnormal physiology and fluid overload.
4. Continue metoprolol for rate control and consider adding additional nodal agents if necessary.
5. Clarify goals of care with the patient's son and address anticoagulation needs.
6. Consider switching to Remeron for agitation and delirium.
7. Continue to follow geriatrics recommendations concerning management of delirium and attempt to normalize sleep-wake cycle.
8. Monitor lab results closely and adjust medications as necessary.
9. Consider f/u metanephrines for consideration of pheo.
10. Continue to check lytes and replete PRN."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and worsening renal function.
   Patient continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND
   labile hypertension.  Cr stable, now to 3.8.  Patient has resistant
   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.  Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son
 issue of anticoagulation needs to be
   address
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   - - f/u metanephrines for consideration of pheo
 this seems unlikely
   given normal HR and lack of additional stigmata a/w catecholamine
   excess
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   7L for [**Location 4982**] goal I & O
s are even today
   ##. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - continue to follow Geriatrics recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and worsening renal function.
   Patient continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND
   labile hypertension.  Cr stable, now to 3.8.  Patient has resistant
   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.  Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension.

The patient continues to experience hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema, exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and worsening renal function. She has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely resulting from mitral regurgitation and decompensated heart failure. Her blood pressure remains labile, ranging from 120 to 240 mmHg systolic, often exacerbated by agitation and delirium.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with improving creatinine levels and sufficient urine output. However, she remains at risk for fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

The patient's agitation and delirium continue to exacerbate her hypertension, and she is receiving sedation and antipsychotic medication to regulate her sleep-wake cycle.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening pulmonary edema and respiratory failure due to continued fluid overload and resistant hypertension.
2. Progression of atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter or atrial standstill, leading to further cardiovascular instability.
3. Development of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to underlying cardiac disease and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Further deterioration of renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and ongoing bleeding risk from the patient's cardiac condition.
6. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to underlying comorbidities and potential infections.
7. Increased risk of respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation due to ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxia.
8. Potential for cardiac arrest or sudden death due to underlying cardiac disease and electrolyte imbalances.

In light of these potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely, and to adjust her treatment plan as necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a complex medical history, including resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving palliative care with a focus on symptom management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 197/52 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and high-flow nebulization, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 95%. The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 98%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL, and a phosphorus level of 3.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes antihypertensive medications, including metoprolol, and diuretics, including furosemide. The patient is also receiving pain management medications, including hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and morphine sulfate.

The patient's clinical course has been marked by resistant hypertension, which has led to concerns about cardiac function and the potential for cardiac complications. The patient's pulmonary edema has also been a significant concern, with the patient requiring oxygen therapy and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to maintain adequate oxygenation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's resistant hypertension and pulmonary edema increase the risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema and respiratory failure increase the risk of respiratory complications, including respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, and respiratory arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury increase the risk of renal complications, including acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease progression, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and indwelling catheters increase the risk of infectious complications, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical course to ensure prompt recognition and management of any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual with a complex medical history, including resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with various medications, including antihypertensives, diuretics, and sedatives.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is likely to worsen due to their underlying medical conditions, which may lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's poor renal function and continued use of nephrotoxic medications may increase their risk of developing AKI, which could further compromise their already compromised renal function.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's resistant hypertension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and arterial lines may increase their risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to their underlying medical conditions and medications, which could lead to increased agitation, aggression, and risk of falls and other accidents.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's poor nutritional status and continued use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase their risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, including constipation, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's labile blood pressure and heart rate may lead to hemodynamic instability, which could worsen their underlying medical conditions and increase their risk of mortality.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team should continue to monitor their vital signs and laboratory results closely, adjust their medications as necessary, and provide supportive care to manage their symptoms and improve their overall condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   # Disposition: now DNR/DNI with palliative care making arrangements for
   home BIPAP and dilaudid PCA with home hospice
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and poor renal function. Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Patient has resistant systolic HTN and is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **]
   reduced as evidenced by low diastolic BP and we are unable to improve
   BP control.
   - continue current HTN regimine
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema results from physiology
   and not fluid status
   # AF with RVR:  likely resulted from MR with element of decompensated
   HF. Amiodarone initially started but then discontinued for concern of
   QTc prolongation w/ anti-psychotics. Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate and BP control
   - defer anticoagulation as not c/w long term GOC
   #. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delirium and improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   -8.5L for [**Location 4982**] defer additional diuresis
   #. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - update Geriatrics re: goals of care
   #. Prophylaxis: PPI, needs bowel regimine
   #. Access: a-line, PICC
   #. Code: DNR/DNI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition is characterized by:

1. Resistant hypertension, which is exacerbated by agitation, delirium, and pulmonary edema.
2. Pulmonary edema, likely caused by mitral regurgitation (MR) and exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and poor renal function.
3. Poor renal function, with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Delirium, with abnormal sleep-wake cycles, which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
5. Hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring BiPAP support for adequate oxygenation and comfort.
6. Lable hypertension, with pressures ranging from 120/240 mmHg, often exacerbated by agitation and delirium.
7. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with acute on chronic renal failure, requiring close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes.
8. Presence of multiple medical devices, including an arterial line and PICC line.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening pulmonary edema, leading to respiratory failure and potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Uncontrolled hypertension, leading to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening CKD, leading to electrolyte imbalances and potential need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Delirium and agitation, which can worsen hypertension and increase the risk of falls, injuries, and medication errors.
5. Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be life-threatening in this population.
6. Malnutrition, which can exacerbate underlying medical conditions and increase the risk of complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening if not promptly addressed.

In light of these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, cardiologists, nephrologists, and other specialists as needed. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the plan is to transition to home hospice care with BIPAP and Dilaudid PCA support."
