   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Surveillance blood cultures in daily
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow lactates and abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy
   tissue
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3
   .
   # Mild hypercalcemia:
   First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   .
   # Hypertension:
   Hold home lisinopril while concern for hypovolemic shock and evolving
   sepsis.
   .
   # COPD:
   Assess ventilator for evidence of airway resistance and initiate
   bronchodilators if indicated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow lactates and abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy
   tissue
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): The patient is likely experiencing a multifactorial shock due to hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is necessary to address this condition.
2. SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS): The patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain, which is likely due to the development of small bowel obstruction. NPO, OG tube to wall suction, and aggressive fluid resuscitation are necessary to manage this condition.
3. ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia: The patient developed atrial flutter shortly after arriving in the ICU, which is likely due to the inflammatory response to sepsis. Amiodarone is being used to control the rate, and consideration is being given to DC cardioversion if the patient's blood pressure remains limited despite maximal vasoactive agents.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, likely due to ATN from sepsis and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and urine output is necessary to manage this condition.
5. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely due to a history of CAD and prior MI. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this condition.
6. Mild Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are elevated, which was first noticed intra-operatively. Trending and repleting calcium levels as needed is necessary to manage this condition.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, likely due to the inflammatory response to sepsis. Holding home lisinopril and monitoring blood pressure are necessary to manage this condition.
8. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, which may require ventilator adjustments and bronchodilators to manage this condition.

The patient's overall condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to address these potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Surveillance blood cultures in daily
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Surveillance blood cultures in daily
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow lactates and abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy
   tissue
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)/Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have a volvulus and colostomy, which was reversed. He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and had a myocardial infarction (MI) 15 years ago. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension (shock), small bowel obstruction (SBO), atrial flutter (AFLUTTER), acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated troponin, mild hypercalcemia, hypertension, and COPD.

24-hour events:

* The patient's arterial line and multi-lumen line were started.
* Blood cultures were taken.
* The patient received fluid resuscitation, vasopressin, and phenylephrine to augment blood pressure.
* The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted to maintain mechanical ventilation.
* The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to cover bowel flora.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension (shock): The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, with contributions from hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors may be necessary to maintain blood pressure.
2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient's SBO may be due to adhesions or intussusception. NPO status, OG tube to wall suction, and aggressive fluid resuscitation may be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER): The patient's AFLUTTER may be due to cardiac disease or electrolyte imbalances. Amiodarone may be necessary to control the patient's heart rate.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may be due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia, or pre-renal azotemia. Close monitoring of creatinine and urine output may be necessary to manage this condition.
5. Elevated troponin: The patient's elevated troponin may be due to cardiac disease or sepsis. Troponins may need to be repeated to monitor for resolution.
6. Mild hypercalcemia: The patient's mild hypercalcemia may be due to vitamin D deficiency or parathyroid disease. Close monitoring of calcium levels and repletion as needed may be necessary.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be due to fluid resuscitation or underlying cardiac disease. Lisinopril may need to be held pending further evaluation.
8. COPD: The patient's COPD may require bronchodilators and close monitoring of ventilator settings to manage airway resistance.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as needed.
3. Consider DC cardioversion if the patient's AFLUTTER is not controlled with amiodarone.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine and urine output to manage AKI.
5. Repeat troponins to monitor for resolution.
6. Close monitor the patient's calcium levels and replete as needed.
7. Hold lisinopril pending further evaluation.
8. Assess the patient's ventilator settings and adjust as necessary to manage COPD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs; will try
   PS today given minimal vent settings at present.
   - Vanc level in AM
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - q8h lytes
   - will address issue of nutrition with surgery today and consider TPN
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control (will continue IV given bowel
   resection)
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3
   .
   # Mild hypercalcemia:
   First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   .
   # Hypertension:
   Hold home lisinopril while concern for hypovolemic shock and evolving
   sepsis.
   .
   # COPD:
   Assess ventilator for evidence of airway resistance and initiate
   bronchodilators if indicated.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days' duration, following a history of volvulus and colostomy. He was diagnosed with hypotension (shock), likely multifactorial in origin, and is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation. He also has small bowel obstruction, likely secondary to prior abdominal surgeries, and is being managed with nasogastric tube decompression and fluid resuscitation.

The patient has atrial flutter and tachycardia, which is being managed with amiodarone. He has acute kidney injury, likely due to ATN from sepsis and hypovolemia, and is being monitored for resolution. His troponin levels are elevated, which may be related to a history of CAD and prior MI. He also has mild hypercalcemia, which is being trended and repleted as needed.

The patient has a history of hypertension and is being managed with hold on home lisinopril. He has COPD and is being assessed for ventilator settings and bronchodilators.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of hypotension and shock, potentially leading to organ failure.
2. Development of sepsis and septic shock.
3. Progression of small bowel obstruction, potentially leading to bowel necrosis and perforation.
4. Recurrent atrial flutter and tachycardia, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
5. Worsening of acute kidney injury, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
6. Development of electrolyte imbalances, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
7. Worsening of COPD, potentially leading to respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation.
8. Development of DVT or PE, potentially leading to pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular complications.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 Shock: likely distributive + hypovolemic, now primarily distributive,
   likely due to GNR bacteremia and ischemic bowel
   - continues to appear fluid responsive with BP response and improved
   urine output
   - on zosyn/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] check [**First Name3 (LF) **] level tomorrow morning
   - continue phenylephrine and vasopressin, plan to wean phenylephrine
   - f/u GNR speciation
 SBO/Ischemic bowel
   - s/p resection, stoma looks pink this morning
   - surgery following, if stabilizes long term plan is re-anastomosis in
   the future
   - on bowel rest, will d/w surgery about TPN plan
Renal Failure: likely pre-renal + ATN, lytes stable
   - urine output improved
   - drugs renally dosed
 Mechanical Ventilation/Respiratory Failure
   - on low TV and tolerating well
   - will continue mechanical intubation until able to self-diurese or
   tolerate lasix
 Atrial Flutter: resolved with amiodarone and off of levophed
   - will likely not need amiodarone long term, but will continue for now
   - continue IV drip given poor gut absorption
 (+) Tn: resolved, likely supply-demand mismatch

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, CAD, and COPD who presented with abdominal pain after undergoing an emergency laparotomy with resection of a large amount of ischemic small bowel. He was found to have GNR growing in his blood cultures and has been experiencing distributive shock, likely due to the bacteremia and ischemic bowel. He has been responding to fluid resuscitation and has improved urine output. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and is on vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and ischemic bowel may lead to further septic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's likely pre-renal and ATN renal failure may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory failure, and he may require further intervention.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's distributive shock and atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's ischemic bowel and SBO may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation, abscess, or fistula.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and mechanical ventilation may lead to neurological complications, such as delirium or cognitive impairment.
7. Infection: The patient's GNR bacteremia may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
8. Bleeding: The patient's vasopressors and anticoagulation may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of his underlying gastrointestinal and cardiovascular conditions.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 Shock: likely distributive + hypovolemic, now primarily distributive,
   likely due to GNR bacteremia and ischemic bowel
   - continues to appear fluid responsive with BP response and improved
   urine output
   - on zosyn/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] check [**First Name3 (LF) **] level tomorrow morning
   - continue phenylephrine and vasopressin, plan to wean phenylephrine
   - f/u GNR speciation
 SBO/Ischemic bowel
   - s/p resection, stoma looks pink this morning
   - surgery following, if stabilizes long term plan is re-anastomosis in
   the future
   - on bowel rest, will d/w surgery about TPN plan
Renal Failure: likely pre-renal + ATN, lytes stable
   - urine output improved
   - drugs renally dosed
 Mechanical Ventilation/Respiratory Failure
   - on low TV and tolerating well
   - will continue mechanical intubation until able to self-diurese or
   tolerate lasix
 Atrial Flutter: resolved with amiodarone and off of levophed
   - will likely not need amiodarone long term, but will continue for now
   - continue IV drip given poor gut absorption
Coagulopathy: stable, s/p vitamin K, likely [**2-23**] DIC
 (+) Tn: resolved, likely supply-demand mismatch

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with abdominal pain and was diagnosed with ischemic bowel and GNR bacteremia. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% and his partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 358 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a blood pressure of 123/65 mmHg and a heart rate of 88 beats per minute. He is receiving vasoactive medications, including phenylephrine and vasopressin, to support his blood pressure.
* Renal status: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL and is receiving fluids and vasopressors to support his blood pressure. His urine output has improved, but he is still at risk for renal failure.
* Neurological status: The patient is intubated and sedated, and his neurological status is unknown due to his sedation and intubation.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a stoma and is receiving bowel rest. His abdominal pain has decreased, but he is still at risk for complications such as bowel obstruction and perforation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to GNR bacteremia
* Renal failure due to hypovolemia and ATN
* Respiratory failure due to mechanical ventilation and potential lung injury
* Coagulopathy due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Bowel obstruction or perforation due to ischemic bowel and bowel rest
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to amiodarone therapy
* Vitamin K deficiency due to prolonged hospitalization and malnutrition

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and vasoactive medications to support his blood pressure
* Antibiotic therapy with zosyn to treat GNR bacteremia
* Bowel rest and potential transition to total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Monitoring of renal function and potential transition to dialysis
* Monitoring of neurological status and potential weaning of sedation
* Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and potential adjustment of amiodarone therapy
* Vitamin K supplementation to prevent deficiency

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 Shock: likely distributive + hypovolemic, now primarily distributive,
   likely due to GNR bacteremia and ischemic bowel
   - continues to appear fluid responsive with BP response and improved
   urine output
   - on zosyn/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] check [**First Name3 (LF) **] level tomorrow morning
   - continue phenylephrine and vasopressin, plan to wean phenylephrine
   - f/u GNR speciation
 SBO/Ischemic bowel
   - s/p resection, stoma looks pink this morning
   - surgery following, if stabilizes long term plan is re-anastomosis in
   the future
   - on bowel rest, will d/w surgery about TPN plan
Renal Failure: likely pre-renal + ATN, lytes stable
   - urine output improved
   - drugs renally dosed
 Mechanical Ventilation/Respiratory Failure
   - on low TV and tolerating well
   - will continue mechanical intubation until able to self-diurese or
   tolerate lasix
 Atrial Flutter: resolved with amiodarone and off of levophed
   - will likely not need amiodarone long term, but will continue for now
   - continue IV drip given poor gut absorption

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with abdominal pain and underwent exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic small bowel. The patient has been experiencing septic shock likely due to Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia and ischemic bowel.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.9°C (98.5°F), HR 88 bpm, BP 123/65 mmHg, RR 23 breaths/min, SpO2 99%.
* Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation with FiO2 40%, PEEP 5 cmH2O, Vt 400 mL, RR 22 breaths/min.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 9 mmHg, mixed venous O2% sat 73%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 1.8 K/uL, Hct 31.3%, Plt 150 K/uL, Cr 1.3 mg/dL, TropT <0.01 ng/mL, TCO2 21 mmHg, Glucose 146 mg/dL.
* Physical examination: Sedated and intubated, with constricted pupils, distant heart sounds, and diminished posteriorly with crackles.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to ongoing sepsis and potential development of multi-organ failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has improved, but the patient is still at risk for further decline in renal function due to pre-renal and ATN.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a stable coagulopathy, but is at risk for further bleeding due to the presence of GNR bacteremia and ischemic bowel.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and is at risk for further respiratory decline due to ongoing sepsis and potential development of ARDS.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has resolved atrial flutter, but is at risk for further arrhythmias due to ongoing sepsis and potential development of electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for further gastrointestinal complications due to ongoing sepsis and potential development of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

The plan for the patient's care is to:

1. Continue to manage septic shock with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust dosing of renally cleared medications accordingly.
3. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma as needed.
4. Wean the patient off vasopressors and phenylephrine as tolerated.
5. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
6. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust therapy as needed.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the plan is to continue ICU care until the patient is stabilized and ready for transfer to a step-down unit or discharge."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 2 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel.  Also GNR in blood cultures from ED.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel [**Last Name (LF) 12253**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be able to DC vancomycin
   today.  Will redose Zosyn as creatinine now improved.
   - Will leave vasopressin on through the day and may be able to wean
   tonight
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Continue current vent settings.  Is significantly fluid positive and
   will likely need diuresis prior to extubation but need to wean all
   pressors first.  No need for SBT in the morning.
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO for now
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - Check pm lytes
   - can likely trial tube feeds tomorrow if off pressors
   #. ANEMIA: had significant Hct drop since yesteray, likely dilutional
   in setting of getting fluid resuscitation.
   - check repeat Hct
   - Will transfuse to goal >25 per surgery team
   - Active type and screen
   - Guaiac stools but likely will be positive
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped last night
   in the setting of bradycardia.  ECG appears to show wandering atrial
   pacemaker with bradycardia.
   - Repeat 12 lead to assess rhythm
   - Continue to hold amiodarone
   #. Coagulopathy: Was likely in DIC on admission,  but with increased
   fibrinogen due to acute phase reactants.
   - Trend coags
   - Check haptoglobin, consider TTP
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Elevated troponin:  Has had stable troponins and no evidence of
   ischemic cardiac disease
   # Mild hypercalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who underwent surgery for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 55 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute (IPM)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His blood cultures are positive for gram-negative rods (GNR), and he is receiving empiric antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.8%
* White blood cell count: 6.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 168 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mEq/L
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 132 mEq/L, potassium 3.5 mEq/L, calcium 7.0 mg/dL, magnesium 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus 2.7 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 136 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's radiology reports show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR) final read: increasing bibasilar pleural effusions and atelectasis
* CXR wet read: ETT 1.7 cm above the carina, can be withdrawn by approximately 1.5 cm for optimal positioning

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypotension (shock): likely septic and distributive shock due to inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO): likely developed due to prior abdominal surgeries and volvulus
* Anemia: likely dilutional due to fluid resuscitation
* Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER) / tachycardia: had aflutter with RVR after arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped due to bradycardia
* Coagulopathy: likely in DIC on admission, but with increased fibrinogen due to acute phase reactants
* Acute kidney injury: had acute elevation of creatinine on admission, now back to baseline
* Elevated troponin: has had stable troponins and no evidence of ischemic cardiac disease
* Mild hypercalcemia: first noticed intra-operatively
* Hypertension: hold home lisinopril while hypotensive

The patient's plan includes:

* Aggressive fluid resuscitation
* Empiric antibiotics for GNR coverage
* Continue current vent settings
* Follow pending cultures
* Continue OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowel peri-operatively
* Check repeat Hct and transfuse to goal >25% per surgery team
* Active type and screen
* Trend coags and check haptoglobin, consider TTP
* Trend creatinine and UOP
* Continue to hold amiodarone
* Monitor for signs of DIC and bleeding
* Monitor for signs of SBO and bowel obstruction
* Monitor for signs of anemia and bleeding
* Monitor for signs of atrial flutter and tachycardia
* Monitor for signs of coagulopathy and bleeding
* Monitor for signs of acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalance
* Monitor for signs of mild hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs; will try
   PS today given minimal vent settings at present.
   - Vanc level in AM
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - q8h lytes
   - will address issue of nutrition with surgery today and consider TPN
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control (will continue IV given bowel
   resection)
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3
   .
   # Mild hypercalcemia:
   First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   .
   # Hypertension:
   Hold home lisinopril while concern for hypovolemic shock and evolving
   sepsis.
   .
   # COPD:
   Assess ventilator for evidence of airway resistance and initiate
   bronchodilators if indicated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who presented with a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. He has a history of volvulus and colostomy reversal, and was found to have feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, and is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and there is a risk of organ dysfunction or failure, including acute kidney injury, cardiac dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further kidney damage due to continued sepsis and hypovolemia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and prior MI, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial flutter, and cardiac failure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a SBO and is at risk of further bowel obstruction, perforation, and peritonitis.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's mild hypercalcemia may worsen and require treatment.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen and require treatment.
8. COPD: The patient has COPD and is at risk of respiratory failure and exacerbation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to manage septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue antibiotics and consider adding additional antibiotics if cultures are positive.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider adding anti-arrhythmic medications if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider adjusting ventilator settings or adding bronchodilators if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider adding nasogastric suction or tube feeding if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or intensivist to further manage the patient's cardiac and respiratory status."

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs; will try
   PS today given minimal vent settings at present.
   - Vanc level in AM

 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration.
   .
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   hypovolemic, distributive, and cardiogenic shock. Hypovolemic shock
   likely induced by poor PO intake prior to presentation. Distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel. Cardiogenic shock possible in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation in patient with unknown systolic
   function as well as cardiomyopathy of acute illness and sepsis.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Vanc/Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
   - phenylephrine and vasopressin to augment BP; will attempt to wean
   vasopressin again today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Maintain ventilation mechanically while giving fluids and awaiting
   likely blossoming of inflammatory response to sepsis in lungs; will try
   PS today given minimal vent settings at present.
   - Vanc level in AM
   .
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - q8h lytes
   - will address issue of nutrition with surgery today and consider TPN
   .
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:
   Developed shortly after arriving in ICU, no clearly visible flutter
   waves, though tough to assess in setting of low-amplitude p-waves at
   baseline. Most likely a-flutter given fixed regular rate of ~150.
   - Continue amiodarone for rate control (will continue IV given bowel
   resection)
   - consider DC cardioversion if limited BP despite maximal vasoactive
   agents
   .
   # Acute kidney injury:
   Creatinine at presentation to the hospital was Cr 2.6, baseline Cr
   1.1-1.3. Likely multifactorial due to ATN from sepsis, hypovolemia
   causing pre-renal azotemia.  Improved this AM, likely secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.
   - Monitor for resolution with trend of creatinine
   - UOP continues to be low but adequate
 40-60 cc/hr, will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # Elevated troponin:
   In setting of history of CAD with prior MI by history and evidenced in
   EKGs dating back over 15 years. Stress test last performed in [**2107**] and
   was without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Patient's last lipid
   panel in [**8-/2121**] revealed HDL 87 and LDL 102. Patient not on statin or
   aspirin at home.
   - troponins neg x 3
   .
   # Mild hypercalcemia:
   First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   .
   # Hypertension:
   Hold home lisinopril while concern for hypovolemic shock and evolving
   sepsis.
   .
   # COPD:
   Assess ventilator for evidence of airway resistance and initiate
   bronchodilators if indicated.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 3 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel.  Also GNR in blood cultures from ED.
   - Fluid resuscitate prn
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**])
   - Will continue to attempt to wean vasopressin today
   - Follow pending cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   - Changed to PS this AM.  Will check gas and reevaluate.  Is
   significantly fluid positive and will likely need diuresis prior to
   extubation but need to wean all pressors first.
   - if stays off pressors, will start active diuresis with prn lasix; if

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 3 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel.  Also GNR in blood cultures from ED.
   - Fluid resuscitate prn
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**])
   - Will continue to attempt to wean vasopressin today
   - Follow pending cultures
   # Respiratory failure:
   - Changed to PS this AM.  Will check gas and reevaluate.  Is
   significantly fluid positive and will likely need diuresis prior to
   extubation but need to wean all pressors first.
   - if stays off pressors, will start active diuresis with prn lasix; if
   BP drops, may use lasix drip
   - bolus sedation with fentanyl

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 3 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Feel most likely is septic and distributive
   shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well
   as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria
   through ischemic bowel.  Also GNR in blood cultures from ED.
   - Fluid resuscitate aggressively
   - Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**])
   - Will continue to attempt to wean vasopressin today
   - Follow pending cultures
   - Changed to PS this AM.  Will check gas and reevaluate.  Is
   significantly fluid positive and will likely need diuresis prior to
   extubation but need to wean all pressors first.
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   - Appreciate input from surgery team
   - NPO for now
   - OG tube to wall suction to decompress bowl peri-operative
   - Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   - Check pm lytes
   - can likely trial tube feeds when off pressors
   #. ANEMIA: had significant Hct drop since yesteray, likely dilutional
   in setting of getting fluid resuscitation.
   - Will transfuse to goal >25 per surgery team
   - Active type and screen
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  ECG appears to show wandering atrial pacemaker
   with bradycardia.
   - Repeat 12 lead to assess rhythm
   - Continue to hold amiodarone
   #. Coagulopathy: Was likely in DIC on admission,  but with increased
   fibrinogen due to acute phase reactants.
   - Trend coags
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   - Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Elevated troponin:  Has had stable troponins and no evidence of
   ischemic cardiac disease
   # Mild hypercalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   - Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while hypotensive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent surgery, resulting in removal of ischemic bowel. He is currently in the ICU with a history of volvulus, colostomy, and prior abdominal surgeries. The patient is experiencing hypotension, septic shock, and distributive shock due to inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection. He has a GNR infection in his blood cultures and is being treated with Zosyn empirically.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* HR: 57 bpm
* BP: 96/47 mmHg
* RR: 19 breaths/min
* SpO2: 98%

Laboratory results show:

* Hct: 23.9% to 26.7%
* WBC: 6.1 to 9.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 107 to 106 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 to 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 151 IU/L

Imaging studies show:

* CXR: Mild cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, and bilateral pleural effusions
* Abdominal CT: Ischemic bowel and SBO

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to GNR infection
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia and sepsis
3. Coagulopathy due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
4. Hypotension and shock due to distributive shock and sepsis
5. Atrial flutter and tachycardia due to electrolyte imbalance and cardiac stress
6. Anemia due to blood loss and dilutional anemia
7. Mild hypercalcemia due to acute phase reactants
8. Hypertension due to medication and cardiac stress

The patient's plan includes:

1. Aggressive fluid resuscitation to treat hypotension and shock
2. Empirical antibiotic coverage for GNR infection
3. Attempt to wean vasopressin and other pressors
4. Follow pending cultures and abdominal exam
5. Continue to monitor and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old gentleman who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have a small bowel obstruction (SBO) after a colostomy reversal. He was admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 57 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 96/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.7%
* Platelet count: 106 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.1 K/uL
* Blood cultures: GNR (Gram-negative rod) positive
* Troponin: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 151 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Mild cardiomegaly, low lung volumes, and bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis is present, which has increased from the day before.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypotension (shock): likely septic and distributive shock due to inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO): likely developed due to prior abdominal surgeries and volvulus
* Anemia: significant Hct drop since yesterday, likely dilutional
* Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER) / tachycardia: wandering atrial pacemaker with bradycardia
* Coagulopathy: likely in DIC on admission, but with increased fibrinogen due to acute phase reactants
* Acute kidney injury: likely prerenal as responsive to fluids
* Elevated troponin: stable troponins with no evidence of ischemic cardiac disease
* Mild hypercalcemia: first noticed intra-operatively

The patient's plan includes:

* Fluid resuscitation to treat hypotension
* Empiric antibiotics to cover bowel flora
* Weaning of vasopressin
* Following pending cultures
* Changing to pressure support (PS) mode to improve respiratory mechanics
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment accordingly
* NPO status with OG tube to decompress the bowel peri-operatively
* Trial of tube feeds when off pressors
* Transfusion to goal >25% for anemia
* Active type and screen
* Repeat 12-lead ECG to assess rhythm and continue to hold amiodarone
* Trend coagulation studies
* Trend creatinine and urine output
* Replete calcium as needed
* Hold home lisinopril while hypotensive

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: NPO with TF recs requested
* Glycemic control: insulin sliding scale
* Lines: arterial line, 18-gauge IV, and multi-lumen IV
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with heparin SQ, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker, and VAP prophylaxis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, atrial flutter, and hypotension. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, vasopressin, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 107 x 10^9/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction may lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or sepsis.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may increase the risk of stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to further complications such as organ failure, shock, or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's antibiotics may not be effective against the underlying infection, leading to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may not be adequate, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to further complications such as bleeding or hemorrhage.
7. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may lead to further complications such as renal failure or cardiac arrest.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's small bowel obstruction may lead to further complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
10. Sepsis: The patient's underlying infection may lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ failure."

   Ongoing issues include:
   # Shock (septic) hypotension
    GNR bacteremia and ischemic gut
   -off pressors
   Continue day 4 Zosyn following up speciation and [**Last Name (un) 270**]
   # Respiratory Failure
   - significant pulmonary edema and effusions which is barrier to
   extubation though doing well currently on minimal PS/PEEP and 40% fio2
   - when hemodynamically stable off pressors will attempt t diurese
   (likely lasix gtt)
   --minimize gtt sedation in hope of sbt and extubation in next 1-2 days
   # Bowel ischemia, s/p resection
   - stoma looks good, decreased BS
   - surgery following, d/w surgery issue of ostomy outpt
   - plan for trial tube feeds when hemodynamically improved, though will
   likely need longterm tpn for nutrition
   # Anemia
   - may be dilutional, no obvious site of bleeding, follow post

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU with shock, ischemic bowel, and GNR bacteremia. He underwent emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel and is currently improving. The patient is still experiencing ongoing issues, including septic shock, GNR bacteremia, and ischemic gut. He is also experiencing respiratory failure with significant pulmonary edema and effusions, anemia, and bowel ischemia. The patient's current medications include antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that can lead to multi-organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
2. GNR bacteremia: The patient's GNR bacteremia can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure if not adequately treated.
3. Ischemic gut: The patient's ischemic gut can lead to bowel perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and death if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, increased risk of cardiac failure, and decreased immune function.
6. Arrhythmia: The patient's history of arrhythmia, including supraventricular tachycardia, increases his risk of cardiac arrest and death.
7. DVT: The patient's risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is increased due to his immobilization and underlying medical conditions.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's risk of developing stress ulcer is increased due to his critical illness and immobilization.
9. VAP: The patient's risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is increased due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and underlying medical conditions.
10. ICU-acquired weakness: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases his risk of developing ICU-acquired weakness, which can lead to prolonged recovery and increased risk of mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to septic shock and ischemic bowel. He underwent an emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel and is now improving. He is off vasopressors and has received one unit of packed red blood cells. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/49 mmHg. He is mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. His abdominal examination is soft with a faint bowel sound.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's significant pulmonary edema and effusions may remain a barrier to extubation. He may require further diuresis and sedation management to minimize the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and bacteremia with GNR (Gram-negative rods) bacteremia require ongoing management with antibiotics and close monitoring of his vital signs.
3. Bowel Ischemia: The patient's bowel ischemia, which has been resected, may lead to complications such as ostomy output issues and the need for long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be dilutional or due to bleeding, and he may require further transfusions and monitoring.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to medication or sepsis, and he may require further monitoring and management.
6. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and may require prophylactic anticoagulation.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and may require prophylactic treatment with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker.
8. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his mechanical ventilation and may require prophylactic treatment with elevation of his head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up.
9. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may be indicative of DIC, which requires further monitoring and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for GNR bacteremia and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Manage respiratory failure with diuresis and sedation as needed.
3. Monitor bowel ischemia and ostomy output, and plan for tube feeds and long-term TPN as needed.
4. Monitor anemia and thrombocytopenia, and consider further transfusions and monitoring as needed.
5. Monitor for DVT and stress ulcer, and consider prophylactic treatment as needed.
6. Monitor for VAP, and consider prophylactic treatment with elevation of head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up.
7. Monitor for DIC, and consider further management as needed.
8. Continue to manage the patient's code status as DNR (do not resuscitate).
9. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or another facility as his condition improves."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO). He had a significant amount of ischemic bowel removed and is currently in the ICU for management of septic shock, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg. He is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. His oxygenation is worsening, as evidenced by his ABG results, which show a PaO2 of 214 mmHg and a PaCO2 of 39 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.4 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 106 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a mild hypercalcemia with a calcium level of 7.5 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for a previous episode of volvulus, colostomy, and small bowel obstruction. He has also had a recent episode of septic shock and has been treated with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his recent surgery and the presence of a central line.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation is worsening, and he may require further respiratory support.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he may require further antihypertensive therapy.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is mildly elevated, and he may require further monitoring and treatment.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he may require further transfusion.
7. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, and he may require further monitoring and treatment.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hypertension, hypercalcemia, anemia, and atrial flutter. Further monitoring and treatment will be necessary to manage these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -per micro lab, GNR were anaerobic so had to replate, will not have
   speciation for another 2 days.
   -lasix 20 IV given at 3:30 pm.  was neg about 4 L at 9pm
   -ABG in PM showed worsening oxygenation.  didn't like increasing
   pressure support so increased fiO2.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old gentleman who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have a small bowel obstruction (SBO). He has undergone surgery and has had a significant amount of ischemic bowel removed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.4°C, HR 63 bpm, BP 96/54 mmHg, RR 20 insp/min, SpO2 100%
* Respiratory support: CPAP/PSV with FiO2 50% and RSBI 95
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 7 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total In 313 mL, Total Out 4890 mL, Balance -4577 mL
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC 9.4 K/uL
	+ Hct 23.9%
	+ Plt 106 K/uL
	+ Cr 1.1 mg/dL
	+ TCO2 27 mmHg
	+ Glucose 124 mg/dL
	+ Albumin 2.1 g/dL
	+ Ca++ 7.5 mg/dL
	+ Mg++ 2.1 mg/dL
	+ PO4 3.0 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension/shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk for shock. His hypotension is likely due to septic shock and distributive shock caused by the inflammatory response to surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection.
2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a SBO, which is likely due to adhesions, intussusception, or volvulus. This may lead to further complications such as bowel perforation, peritonitis, or sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV and has a high RSBI, which may indicate respiratory failure. He may require further respiratory support or intubation.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury. His kidney function should be closely monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has decreased, and he may be at risk for anemia. His anemia should be closely monitored, and he may require blood transfusions.
6. Atrial flutter/tachycardia: The patient has atrial flutter with RVR, which may require further treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications.
7. Mild hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is slightly elevated, and he may require further treatment to manage this condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Fluid resuscitation as needed
* Empiric antibiotic treatment for SBO and sepsis
* Follow-up of pending cultures
* Monitoring of respiratory status and potential need for further respiratory support
* Monitoring of kidney function and potential need for dialysis
* Monitoring of anemia and potential need for blood transfusions
* Management of atrial flutter/tachycardia
* Management of mild hypercalcemia

The patient's family has been informed of his condition, and the patient has been placed on a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and CAD who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, GNR bacteremia, and abdominal pain following an emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PSV. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/69 mmHg. He has a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg and is receiving diuretics and vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.4 K/μL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 106 K/μL. His liver function tests are elevated, with an ALT of 13 IU/L and AST of 31 IU/L. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral effusions and atelectasis on chest X-ray. His microbiology results show GNR bacteremia, with pending results from blood cultures.

The patient's ongoing issues include hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, bowel ischemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. He is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, organ failure, and bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's GNR bacteremia and septic shock put him at risk for further sepsis and organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's significant pulmonary edema and effusions may worsen his respiratory status, making it difficult to extubate him.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which could worsen his condition if not addressed.
4. Bowel ischemia: The patient's bowel ischemia following resection may lead to further complications, including perforation or abscess formation.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be dilutional or due to bleeding, and may worsen if not addressed.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase his risk of bleeding, especially if he requires invasive procedures or surgery.
7. Organ failure: The patient's impaired renal and liver function may worsen if not addressed, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and CAD who presented with abdominal pain following an exploratory laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. He developed septic shock with GNR bacteremia, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm (normal range 63-75 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 139/69 mmHg (normal range 96/50-139/69 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (normal range 18-25 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on 50% FiO2
* Central venous pressure: 9 mmHg (normal range 5-21 mmHg)

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 363 mL (normal range 297-390 mL) and a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O (normal range 12-20 cmH2O). He is also receiving diuresis with lasix and has had a total fluid output of 4,890 mL (normal range 3,745-4,890 mL) since admission.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 9.4 x 10^9/L (normal range 4.5-11.5 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL (normal range 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 106 x 10^9/L (normal range 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 29 mg/dL (normal range 7-18 mg/dL)
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL (normal range 8.5-10.5 mg/dL)
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL (normal range 1.8-2.5 mg/dL)
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL (normal range 2.5-4.5 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* Chest X-ray: No significant change, with bilateral effusions and atelectasis.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure
* GNR bacteremia
* Leukocytosis
* Bowel ischemia, s/p resection
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue zosyn for GNR bacteremia, awaiting speciation and sensitivities from cultures
* Continue diuresis with lasix and follow closely for signs of brewing infection
* Check LFTs and consider empirically broadening coverage for VAP and lines if clinical decline occurs
* Initiate TPN to optimize nutritional status
* Continue to monitor and manage the patient's respiratory failure, including adjusting ventilator settings as needed
* Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust fluid management accordingly
* Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust therapy as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Prolonged respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Sepsis and septic shock
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
* Kidney injury and acute kidney injury
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding
* Anemia and bleeding
* Pulmonary edema and effusions
* Cardiovascular instability and cardiac arrest

Based on the patient's condition and the potential medical complications that may arise, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with adjustments to therapy as needed to optimize his care and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 14-year-old with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 125 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 13 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 31 IU/L. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 29.2 seconds.

The patient's microbiology results show pending blood cultures and a positive anaerobic bottle gram stain, which is suggestive of gram-negative rods.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, small bowel obstruction, and shock. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without lipids and has a nasogastric tube in place. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Multi-organ failure: The patient's hypotension and shock can lead to multi-organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
3. Infection: The patient's small bowel obstruction can lead to infection, which can spread to other parts of the body.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and receive adequate nutrition can lead to malnutrition and deficiencies.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's small bowel obstruction can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel perforation and peritonitis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and shock can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory rate can lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's hypotension and shock can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with LLQ abdominal pain and was found to have a small bowel obstruction (SBO) with ischemic bowel. He underwent colostomy reversal and removal of ischemic bowel. He is currently in the ICU, intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a diagnosis of septic and distributive shock, acute kidney injury, mild hypocalcemia, and hypertension. He has a history of volvulus and colostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of shock: The patient's blood pressure is still labile, and he is at risk of developing further hypotension, which could lead to organ failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and he may require further interventions to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are still elevated, and he may require further management to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is still a concern, and he may require further antibiotics and supportive care to manage his infection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's SBO and ischemic bowel may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or abscess formation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and mild hypocalcemia may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation status is currently off, and he may require further management to prevent neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.
8. Infection control: The patient's wound and ostomy site require close monitoring for signs of infection, and he may require further antibiotics or wound care to prevent complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely to assess for any changes or deterioration.
2. Maintain the patient's respiratory support and continue to optimize his oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Manage the patient's shock and hypertension with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and manage his acute kidney injury with fluids and diuretics as needed.
5. Administer antibiotics and supportive care to manage the patient's sepsis and infection.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and manage any further complications that arise.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular and neurological status and manage any further complications that arise.
8. Ensure that the patient's wound and ostomy site are clean and dry, and monitor for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to volvulus and colostomy. He underwent surgery and had significant amount of ischemic bowel removed. He is currently in the ICU with septic shock, distributive shock, and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with SBO, likely due to translocation of bacteria through ischemic bowel, and is being treated with antibiotics and fluids. He also has anemia, atrial flutter, acute kidney injury, mild hypocalcemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and distributive shock may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may worsen, leading to tachycardia and palpitations.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's mild hypocalcemia may worsen, leading to muscle cramps, tingling, and numbness.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
8. DVT: The patient's risk of developing DVT is increased due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
9. VAP: The patient's risk of developing VAP is increased due to his intubation and underlying medical conditions.
10. Infection: The patient's risk of developing infection is increased due to his septic shock and distributive shock.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and CAD, who presented with abdominal pain after undergoing an emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel due to septic shock with GNR bacteremia. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with minimal support. The patient has ongoing issues with respiratory failure, altered mental status, GNR bacteremia, leukocytosis, bowel ischemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration, particularly with the presence of pulmonary edema and effusions.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further complications due to ongoing sepsis, including organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Anoxic Injury: The patient's altered mental status and poor baseline function may be indicative of an anoxic injury, which could lead to long-term cognitive and neurological impairment.
4. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP, which could lead to further respiratory and systemic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's GNR bacteremia and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and failure if not effectively managed.
6. Bowel Ischemia: The patient's bowel ischemia and resection may lead to further complications, including perforation, abscess, and malabsorption.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's bowel ischemia and resection may lead to malnutrition, which could exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and increase the risk of complications.
9. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing fluid administration and potential electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of developing renal failure.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CAD and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, who presented with abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with septic shock with GNR bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient remains critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, with significant pulmonary edema and effusions, which may lead to further deterioration and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including elevated lactate levels, and potential kidney and liver dysfunction.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding and require platelet transfusions.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate ongoing infection or inflammation, and requires close monitoring for signs of brewing infection.
5. Bowel ischemia: The patient's bowel ischemia, despite resection, may lead to ongoing ostomy output and potential complications, such as bowel perforation or obstruction.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutritional status may exacerbate his critical illness and increase the risk of complications, such as infections and organ dysfunction.
7. Vascular access complications: The patient's multiple lines and catheters may increase the risk of vascular access complications, such as thrombosis, bleeding, or infection.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of sepsis and critical illness.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires ongoing close monitoring and management in the ICU, including:

1. Respiratory support: The patient's respiratory status requires continued monitoring and management, including adjustments to ventilator settings and oxygen therapy.
2. Sepsis management: The patient's sepsis requires ongoing management, including antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support.
3. Thrombocytopenia management: The patient's thrombocytopenia requires close monitoring and potential platelet transfusions.
4. Leukocytosis management: The patient's leukocytosis requires close monitoring for signs of brewing infection and potential empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Bowel ischemia management: The patient's bowel ischemia requires ongoing management, including ostomy care, and potential nutritional support.
6. Nutritional support: The patient's poor nutritional status requires initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to optimize his nutritional status.
7. Vascular access management: The patient's multiple lines and catheters require close monitoring for potential complications, including thrombosis, bleeding, or infection.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis: The patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease requires prophylaxis for gastrointestinal bleeding, including stress ulcer prophylaxis and H2 blocker therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 7 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.  Concerning for anoxic brain injury given severe
   hypotension during septic shock.  Mental status appears to be slowly
   improving on repeat exams
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis: Increased today, but no bandemia.  Unclear cause,
   although in the context of hypotension overnight, will pan-culture for
   new sources of infection
    - U/A, Urine Cx
   - Blood cultures today
   - Will send cultures of line tips when a line and CVL are d/c
   - will send C diff if patient passes any stool rectally.
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --Recheck  albumin today
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old man who presented with a small bowel obstruction (SBO) and was found to have ischemic bowel. He was taken to surgery and had a significant amount of ischemic bowel removed. He developed septic shock and was treated with pressors and antibiotics. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place. He has a history of poor mental functioning and has been sedated. His mental status is slowly improving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is at risk for further hypotension and shock due to his underlying condition and the use of pressors.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is at risk for further septic shock due to the presence of bacteria in his bloodstream and the potential for further infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure due to his underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, which may be a sign of infection or inflammation.
5. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient is at risk for anoxic brain injury due to his severe hypotension during septic shock.
6. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient is at risk for further small bowel obstruction due to his underlying condition and the potential for adhesions or intussusception.
7. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient is at risk for further acute kidney injury due to his underlying condition and the use of diuretics.
8. Mild Hypocalcemia: The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which may be a sign of malnutrition or other underlying condition.
9. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be a sign of underlying cardiovascular disease.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his diuretic therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his sedation therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his diuretic therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's calcium levels and adjust his calcium therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his electrolyte therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust his pressor therapy as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.  Concerning for anoxic brain injury given severe
   hypotension during septic shock.
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis: unclear source, but could be reinfected, possibly from
   a line or
    - reculture today

 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**]); although WBC is
   elevated, it is stable with no bands
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Check afternoon lytes
   --Will hold off on lasix if patient auto-diureses
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who presented with LLQ abdominal pain, was found to have SBO, and underwent colostomy reversal. He developed septic shock, distributive shock, and now has volume overload. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to anoxic brain injury or impaired clearance of sedating medications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Re-bleeding: The patient has a history of volvulus and colostomy, which increases the risk of re-bleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Bacteroides fragilis group, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a history of acute kidney injury and is at risk of developing further kidney damage.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation and has a high risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrial flutter and tachycardia, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to anoxic brain injury, which can increase the risk of long-term neurological damage.
7. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and is at risk of developing further infections.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of SBO and is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or abscesses.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has mild hypocalcemia and is at risk of developing further electrolyte imbalances.
10. Blood pressure instability: The patient has had episodes of hypotension and is at risk of developing further blood pressure instability.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status. He should receive antibiotics to cover his positive blood culture, and his fluid status should be closely monitored to prevent volume overload. The patient's respiratory and cardiac status should be closely monitored, and he should receive pain management as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception, adhesions, and beta lactamase-positive Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria in their blood cultures. They have been receiving antibiotics and have had a recent episode of hypotension, which responded to fluid boluses. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 120s-130s mmHg range. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have a head CT scan that is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Intestinal Obstruction: The patient has a small bowel obstruction, which can lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and peritonitis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's recent episode of hypotension may be a sign of ongoing circulatory instability, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's head CT scan is normal, but they may be at risk for neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, or meningitis due to their underlying medical condition.
6. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture, which may indicate a systemic infection that requires further evaluation and treatment.
7. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's underlying medical condition and recent episode of hypotension may lead to organ dysfunction, such as renal or hepatic failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis
    - reculture today

 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**]); although WBC is
   elevated, it is stable with no bands
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Check afternoon lytes
   --Will hold off on lasix if patient auto-diureses
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (day 1 [**1-8**]); although WBC is
   elevated, it is stable with no bands
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Check afternoon lytes
   --Will hold off on lasix if patient auto-diureses
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 87-year-old gentleman who presented with LLQ abdominal pain and was found to have a Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) after reversal of a colostomy.
* He has a history of volvulus and colostomy, and the SBO is likely due to adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries.
* The patient has undergone surgery and has had significant amounts of ischemic bowel removed.
* He is currently in the ICU due to septic and distributive shock, which is likely caused by an inflammatory response to the surgery and acute intra-abdominal infection.
* The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to impaired clearance of sedating medications or other underlying causes.
* He has leukocytosis, but the WBC count is stable with no bands, which suggests that the patient may not have a severe infection.
* The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which was first noticed intra-operatively.
* He has mild acute kidney injury, which is likely prerenal and responsive to fluids.
* The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with diuresis and holds on home lisinopril.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Sepsis: The patient's septic and distributive shock may progress to sepsis if not managed properly.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further diuresis to improve his respiratory function.
* Renal failure: The patient's mild acute kidney injury may worsen if not managed properly, leading to renal failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential impaired clearance of sedating medications may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's SBO and ischemic bowel may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or abscesses.
* Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and presence of Bacteria fragilis group in his blood cultures may indicate a severe infection that requires further management.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess his response to treatment.
* Continue to manage the patient's septic and distributive shock with fluids and pressors as needed.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his diuresis accordingly.
* Trend the patient's creatinine and UOP to assess his renal function.
* Replete the patient's calcium levels as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with diuresis and holds on home lisinopril.
* Consider sending lactate if the patient's abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically.
* Follow the patient's abdominal exam and send lactate if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his sedating medications as needed.
* Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotics based on the results of his blood cultures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus and colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery and had significant ischemic bowel removed. He developed septic shock and distributive shock, which responded to fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.3°C (97.3°F), HR 74 bpm, BP 92/43 mmHg, RR 20 breaths/min, SpO2 95%
* Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) 11 mmHg
* Fluid balance: 3,065 mL input, 4,245 mL output, with a negative balance of -1,180 mL
* Laboratory results: WBC 11.5 x 10^9/L, Hct 30.8%, Plt 125 x 10^9/L, Cr 1.1 mg/dL, TCO2 24 mmHg, Glucose 92 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hypotension and shock: The patient's blood pressure is still relatively low, and he may require further fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require further support with mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient has developed septic shock, and there is a risk of ongoing sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level has normalized, but he may still be at risk for acute kidney injury due to his underlying illness and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is mildly decreased, and he may require further monitoring and repletion to prevent complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition support, but he may require further assessment and optimization to prevent malnutrition.
7. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's altered mental status may be related to sepsis, hypotension, or anoxic brain injury, and he requires ongoing monitoring and management.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple medical complications, including septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. He requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent further complications and optimize his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and CAD who was admitted with septic shock and GNR bacteremia following an emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel. He remains on mechanical ventilation with volume overload and has several ongoing issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension overnight was likely related to hypovolemia, but may also be related to a brewing infection, given the increasing leukocytosis. Surveillance cultures and imaging studies are needed to monitor for potential infections.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is concerning for an evolving infection, particularly given the lack of bandemia and no change in sputum or O2 requirements to suggest ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Infection work-up, including cultures and imaging studies, is necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to edema and effusions, which have been the main barriers to extubation. Continuation of positive pressure ventilation and optimization of fluid overload management are necessary.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to medication, as his head CT did not show any acute process. Slow improvement is expected.
5. GNR bacteremia: The patient's GNR bacteremia requires completion of Zosyn therapy and ongoing surveillance for potential complications.
6. Bowel ischemia: The patient's bowel ischemia, s/p resection, requires ongoing management, including Imodium therapy and trophic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to optimize nutritional status.
7. Potential for C. difficile infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lack of bandemia raise concern for C. difficile infection, which requires empirical coverage if clinical decline occurs.

In summary, the patient requires ongoing management of his septic shock, respiratory failure, and altered mental status, as well as surveillance for potential infections and optimization of his nutritional status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension and CAD, who was admitted with abdominal pain and septic shock due to GNR bacteremia. He underwent emergency laparotomy with resection of ischemic bowel and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation with volume and pressure support. His condition has improved from sepsis standpoint, but he remains hypotensive and requires IV fluids. He has leukocytosis, which is concerning for evolving infection, and has a GNR bacteremia. He is also experiencing respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient is receiving antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has GNR bacteremia and leukocytosis, which may indicate an evolving infection. This could lead to septic shock, organ failure, and increased mortality.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires minimal vent support. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and extubation may not be possible.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to sepsis, hypoxia, or other underlying conditions. This could lead to decreased cognitive function, increased risk of falls, and difficulty with communication.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to volume depletion, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. This could lead to organ hypoperfusion, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a high ostomy output, which may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infection.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CAD and hypertension increases his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's malnutrition and altered mental status may lead to decreased appetite, increased risk of infections, and decreased wound healing.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and altered mental status may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning off the ventilator.
3. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider consulting with a neurologist or psychiatrist.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider increasing fluid intake to prevent hypotension.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal output and consider adjusting medications to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to assess the patient's cardiovascular risk and develop a plan to reduce it.
7. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to develop a plan to improve the patient's nutritional status.
8. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and consider consulting with a wound care specialist to prevent pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
 SHOCK, OTHER
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Leukocytosis:  Continues to increase without a clear source.  Unclear
   cause, and work-up yesterday was not revealing.  One possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
    - Add sensi
s on to bacteroides culture.
   - lines out yesterday and pan-cultured.  No need to repeat today.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 8 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 Respiratory failure:  Could not try extubation today as BP unstable
   and had hypoxic episode.  Hypoxia likely due to effusions seen on CXR.
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal negative 1L/day if BP tolerates.  No
   need for lasix this morning as he is negative while TPN is held.
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - lines out yesterday and pan-cultured.  No need to repeat today.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 8 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 Respiratory failure:  Could not try extubation today as BP unstable
   and had hypoxic episode.  Hypoxia likely due to effusions seen on CXR.
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal negative 1L/day if BP tolerates.  No
   need for lasix this morning as he is negative while TPN is held.
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and colostomy, who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 89/43 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* SpO2: 95%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.8 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 125 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* D-dimer: 2100 ng/mL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis
* Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan: SBO with ischemic bowel

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, acute
* Hypotension, not shock
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO)
* Shock, other
* Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER)
* Leukocytosis
* Hypocalcemia
* Acute kidney injury
* Mild hypocalcemia
* Hypertension

The patient's medications include:

* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Heparin sodium (Prophylaxis)
* Fentanyl
* Insulin SS

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to monitor and manage his respiratory failure
* Continue to diurese and adjust his fluid management
* Continue to monitor his blood pressure and adjust his medications as needed
* Continue to monitor his abdominal exam and send lactate if it worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically
* Continue to monitor his electrolytes and adjust his medications as needed
* Continue to monitor his kidney function and adjust his medications as needed
* Continue to monitor his mental status and adjust his medications as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of his respiratory status, need for mechanical ventilation, or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Hypotension: worsening of his blood pressure, need for vasopressors, or development of shock
* Small bowel obstruction: worsening of his bowel obstruction, need for surgical intervention, or development of bowel perforation
* Leukocytosis: worsening of his white blood cell count, need for antibiotics, or development of sepsis
* Hypocalcemia: worsening of his calcium levels, need for calcium supplementation, or development of muscle cramps
* Acute kidney injury: worsening of his kidney function, need for dialysis, or development of chronic kidney disease
* Mild hypocalcemia: worsening of his calcium levels, need for calcium supplementation, or development of muscle cramps
* Hypertension: worsening of his blood pressure, need for antihypertensive medications, or development of cardiac complications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to adjust his treatment plan accordingly and prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 7 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Possibly impaired clearance of sedating
   medications.  Concerning for anoxic brain injury given severe
   hypotension during septic shock.  Mental status appears to be slowly
   improving on repeat exams
   - will continue to monitor
 Leukocytosis: Increased today, but no bandemia.  Unclear cause,
   although in the context of hypotension overnight, will pan-culture for
   new sources of infection
    - U/A, Urine Cx
   - Blood cultures today
   - Will send cultures of line tips when a line and CVL are d/c
   - will send C diff if patient passes any stool rectally.
 Respiratory failure:
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal net negative 2L/day if BP tolerates
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --Recheck  albumin today
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 82 bpm (within normal range)
* Blood pressure: 89/43 mmHg (hypotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (within normal range)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* SpO2: 59% on 6L oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 18.8 K/uL (elevated)
* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL (decreased)
* Platelet count: 186 K/uL (decreased)
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (elevated)
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L (elevated)
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL (decreased)
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL (decreased)
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL (decreased)
* Phosphate: 3.1 mg/dL (elevated)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis
* Abdominal CT: no clear cause of continued sedation

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception, adhesions
* Shock, other
* Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER)
* Acute kidney injury
* Mild hypocalcemia
* Hypertension

The patient's plan includes:

* Fluid resuscitation as needed
* Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora
* Follow pending blood cultures
* Continue to monitor mental status
* Pan-culture for new sources of infection
* Diuresis to reduce fluid overload
* Decrease pressure support to see how patient tolerates
* Hold TF overnight and plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in the morning if mental status improves
* Continue to monitor abdominal exam and send lactate if worsens or patient deteriorates hemodynamically
* Recheck albumin today
* Continue to monitor and treat hypocalcemia and hypertension
* Continue to trend creatinine and UOP
* Continue to trend and replete calcium and magnesium as needed

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Prolonged hospitalization and ICU stay
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections
* Delayed recovery from surgery
* Development of organ failure (e.g., respiratory, renal, cardiac)
* Increased risk of mortality"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   87 yo male admitted wth ischemic bowel s/p resection. Issues include:
   1.  Acute respiratory failure: Continues to require vent support. Brief
   desats this am which seemed positional- resolved
   Given high [**Last Name (LF) 1398**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue on PSV. Continue to diurese with
   frequent SBT
   2. Hypotension: appears partly mediated by medications, though rising
   leukocytosis also raises question of incompletely controlled infection.
   Will try low dose morphine instead of fentanyl, will call micro lab re;
   bacteroides sensitivities and adjust abx as needed
   3. AMS: appears to be improving- medication related

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key points:

* The patient is an 87-year-old male who is 7 days post-operative from a resection and ileostomy for ischemic small bowel.
* He has acute respiratory failure and requires ventilator support. He experienced brief desaturations this morning, which were positional and resolved.
* He has hypotension, which appears to be partly mediated by medications, but rising leukocytosis raises concerns about incompletely controlled infection.
* He has small bowel obstruction, including intussusception and adhesions.
* He has atrial flutter.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure can progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's rising leukocytosis and bacteroides infection increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction can worsen, leading to further complications such as perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
4. Infection: The patient's bacteroides infection can spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter can progress to atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and sepsis can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's small bowel obstruction and ileostomy can lead to further gastrointestinal complications such as bowel perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue ventilator support to manage acute respiratory failure.
2. Adjust antibiotics based on bacteroides sensitivities to prevent sepsis and infection.
3. Manage small bowel obstruction with nasogastric suction and consider surgical intervention.
4. Monitor for signs of sepsis and infection, and treat promptly if necessary.
5. Manage atrial flutter with antiarrhythmic medications and consider cardioversion.
6. Monitor for signs of renal failure and consider dialysis if necessary.
7. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications and consider surgical intervention if necessary.

The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is ICU. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who was admitted with ischemic bowel disease and underwent resection and ileostomy. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, requiring ventilatory support. He has experienced desaturations, which were resolved, and has been diagnosed with bacteroides infection. His condition is complicated by hypotension, likely due to medications and possibly an incompletely controlled infection. He is also experiencing acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and is at risk for small bowel obstruction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if his ventilatory support is not optimized, or if he develops a respiratory infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteroides infection may progress to sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction may worsen, leading to further complications such as bowel perforation or peritonitis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension may be a sign of cardiac compromise, and he may be at risk for cardiac arrest or other cardiac complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to further complications such as pressure ulcers or impaired wound healing.
9. Cognitive impairment: The patient's acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances may contribute to cognitive impairment, which could worsen his overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize ventilatory support and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust antibiotics based on bacteroides sensitivities and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Manage the patient's small bowel obstruction with conservative measures and consider further interventions if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Correct electrolyte imbalances and monitor for signs of cardiac compromise.
6. Implement infection control measures to prevent further infections.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral or parenteral nutrition if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's cognitive function and consider neuropsychological testing if necessary."

 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously 1.9L negative yesterday but
   effusions persist on CXR.  Respiratory status is improving, with better
   RSBI today.  Interactive and doing well on minimal pressure support,
   may be able to be extubated today, but need to address code status (do
   not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Diuresing well, but still needs more taken off
   --Continue to diurese today, goal negative 1L/day if BP tolerates.  No
   need for lasix this morning as he is negative while TPN is held.
   --Will decrease PS today to see how patient tolerates
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Continues to increase without a clear source.  Unclear
   cause, and work-up yesterday was not revealing.  One possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
    - Add sensitivities on to bacteroides culture.
   - lines out yesterday and pan-cultured.  No need to repeat today.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Feel most likely is septic and
   distributive shock likely occuring due to inflammatory response to
   surgery as well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation
   of bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 8 of 14)
   --Follow pending blood cultures
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Follow abdominal exam, including appearance of ostomy tissue
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) / Tachycardia:  Had aflutter with RVR after
   arriving in ICU and started on amiodarone, which was stopped in the
   setting of bradycardia.  No longer an acute issue.
   # Acute kidney injury:  Had acute elevation of creatinine on admission,
   now back to baseline.  Likely was prerenal as responsive to fluids.
   --Trend creatinine and UOP
   # Mild hypocalcemia: First noticed intra-operatively.
   --Trend and replete as needed
   # Hypertension: Hold home lisinopril while actively diuresing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with LLQ abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to prior abdominal surgeries. He underwent colostomy reversal and removal of ischemic bowel. The patient has been in the ICU for 5 days and has been complicated by septic and distributive shock, respiratory failure, and hypotension. He is currently receiving pain control with dilaudid, and his respiratory status is improving with minimal pressure support. The patient's leukocytosis is increasing without a clear source, and he has been empirically treated with Zosyn for potential bacteroides infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still require mechanical ventilation and close monitoring for potential extubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic and distributive shock may recur if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if he is not adequately resuscitated with fluids and pressors.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's increasing leukocytosis may indicate a worsening infection or a response to inflammatory mediators.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels have normalized, but he may still be at risk for acute kidney injury due to his underlying condition and medication use.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's mild hypocalcemia may worsen if he is not adequately treated with calcium supplements.
7. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's SBO may recur if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
8. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may recur if not treated with anti-arrhythmic medications.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to his underlying condition and the presence of foreign bodies (e.g., catheters, tubes).
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's SBO and ischemic bowel may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which may worsen his condition."

 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING

 SHOCK, OTHER
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, now POD 5 with removal of significant amount of ischemic
   bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now
   volume overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously 1.9L negative yesterday but
   effusions persist on CXR.  Respiratory status was improving, with
   better RSBI in early AM, but then had acute desaturation.  Now
   stabilized again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for
   infection.  Interactive and adequately alert. Still may be able to be
   extubated late today or early tomorrow but need to address code status
   (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Broaden abx for possible VAP given secretions -> add Vanco and Cipro.
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 9 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - no attempt at extubation as RSBI>100 and pt unstable in AM.
   - d/c'ed fentanyl and started frequent low-dose dilaudid for pain
   control.
   - dilaudid causing slight hypotension, tried oxycodone 5mg at midnight.
   - called lab to add sensi's on to [**1-8**] bacteroides sample.
   - negative 2.3L without getting any lasix.
   - 7:30am RSBI in 60s.
   - At 9am, acute desat to 80s with severe agitation.  Increased vent
   settings to PS 13/8 w/ 100% O2, suctioned a large ball of mucus, exam
   w/ ? decreased breath sounds on left.  CXR showed ETT very near
   carina.  Sats then improved, patient given ativan for agitation.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus, who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have a small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery and had a significant amount of ischemic bowel removed. The patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 91/40 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 96%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His respiratory rate is spontaneously 27 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 18.4 x 10^9/L

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male admitted with ischemic bowel s/p resection and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing slow progress on the ventilator due to mechanical ventilation (MV) and volume overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 123/59 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 96%, and his heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, but he was agitated earlier in the day. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender. His extremities are without cyanosis or clubbing, and his skin is warm and without rash or jaundice.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a count of 16.2 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 29 mg/dL, and his creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL. His troponin-T is <0.01 ng/mL, and his CK/CKMB is 208/6 IU/L.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory status is improving, but he still requires oxygen therapy.
2. Ischemic bowel: The patient has a history of ischemic bowel and is currently receiving TPN and antibiotics.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to an underlying infection.
4. Volume overload: The patient has a history of volume overload, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure.
5. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction, which may be contributing to his abdominal pain.
6. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which may be contributing to his tachycardia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and wean oxygen therapy as tolerated.
2. Re-position the endotracheal tube to improve lung function.
3. Add inhalers to improve pulmonary toilet.
4. Add vancomycin and ciprofloxacin to the patient's antibiotic regimen for empiric coverage of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Follow up on sputum Gram stain and culture results.
6. Broaden the patient's antibiotic coverage to include coverage for potential VAP.
7. Continue TPN and monitor the patient's nutritional status.
8. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary.
9. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 (H2) blocker.
10. Continue DVT prophylaxis with heparin.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI in
   early AM yesterdayt but then had acute desaturation.  Now stabilized
   again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection.
   Interactive and adequately alert. Can try extubation this AM but need
   to address code status (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI in
   early AM yesterdayt but then had acute desaturation.  Now stabilized
   again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection.
   Interactive and adequately alert. Can try extubation this AM but need
   to address code status (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of volvulus and subsequent colostomy, followed by small bowel obstruction (SBO) and removal of ischemic bowel. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, septic shock, and volume overload.

The patient has been on various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and pain management medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.3°F, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98%, and they are receiving 50% oxygen via endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's blood cultures have grown Bacteroides species, and the patient is being treated empirically with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with better respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) in the early morning. However, the patient experienced acute desaturation yesterday, which was likely due to mucous plugging or intubation of the main stem bronchus.

The patient's abdominal examination is soft and non-distended, with no signs of intra-abdominal bleeding or abscess. The patient's ostomy output is yellowish, and the patient is receiving lactate-free diet.

The patient's mental status is stable, with no clear cause of continued sedation. The patient's wife has been informed of the patient's condition and has expressed a desire for the patient to be extubated if possible.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but they still require mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of reintubation if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and they have grown Bacteroides species in their blood cultures. There is a risk of sepsis and septic shock.
3. Volume overload: The patient has been experiencing volume overload, which can lead to cardiac failure and respiratory compromise.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of SBO and removal of ischemic bowel, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and abscess.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including respiratory failure, infection, volume overload, hypotension, and gastrointestinal complications. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and improve their overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's 24-hour events include a desaturation episode yesterday morning, which was likely caused by mucous plugging or intubation of the main stem bronchus. The patient was given ativan and calmed down, and the saturation levels returned to normal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/45 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 286 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired skin integrity, and the patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers. The patient's neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient's intubation status.

The patient's medical history is significant for atrial flutter, and the patient is currently being treated with anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, antibiotic therapy for VAP, and aggressive suctioning to prevent mucous plugging. The patient will also be monitored for signs of respiratory failure, and the patient's blood pressure will be closely monitored to prevent hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if the patient's lungs are not adequately ventilated, or if the patient develops a respiratory infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's VAP can progress to pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately managed, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Shock: The patient's shock can worsen if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately managed, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction can worsen if the patient's bowel is not adequately decompressed, which can lead to bowel perforation and peritonitis.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for developing several medical complications, and the patient's plan of care should be focused on preventing and managing these complications to improve the patient's outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI in
   early AM yesterdayt but then had acute desaturation.  Now stabilized
   again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection.
   Interactive and adequately alert. Can try extubation this AM but need
   to address code status (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI in
   early AM yesterdayt but then had acute desaturation.  Now stabilized
   again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection.
   Interactive and adequately alert. Can try extubation this AM but need
   to address code status (do not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Diuresing well without lasix, goal slightly negative today.
   --Wean PS back down to 5/5 with 50% O2 when possible.
   - Hold TF overnight with plan to do RSBI and possibly extubate in AM if
   mental status improved
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are broadening abx coverage as
   above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with a history of volvulus and colostomy, presenting with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and later diagnosed with small bowel obstruction (SBO). He underwent surgery to remove ischemic bowel and developed septic, distributive shock, and volume overload. Currently, he is receiving empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with better respiratory system compliance (RSBI) in the early morning, but he experienced an acute desaturation episode. He is now stabilized, and his mucus plug and leukocytosis are concerning for infection. The patient is interactive and adequately alert, and it is planned to try extubation this morning, pending a discussion about code status.

The patient's leukocytosis is stable, and broadened antibiotic coverage is being considered due to the possibility of Zosyn-resistant bacteroides or an unpenetrable source of infection. The patient's hypotension and possible bacteremia are thought to be related to septic and distributive shock, and he is being fluid-resuscitated as needed.

The patient's altered mental status is improving, and it is likely related to slow clearance of sedating medications. He has a history of poor mental functioning and a CT head scan did not reveal a clear cause for continued sedation.

The patient's SBO is being managed with surgery recommendations, and he is receiving lactate if his abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically. His large ostomy output is being monitored, and Imodium has been started.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute desaturation episode and persistent effusions on CXR suggest that he may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and broadened antibiotic coverage suggest that he may be at risk for infection, particularly with Zosyn-resistant bacteroides.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of septic and distributive shock, and his current fluid resuscitation, suggest that he may be at risk for hypotension.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's history of poor mental functioning and continued sedation suggest that he may be at risk for further deterioration in his mental status.
5. SBO: The patient's SBO is a risk factor for further complications, including bowel perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis.
6. Bacteremia: The patient's possible bacteremia and broadened antibiotic coverage suggest that he may be at risk for bacteremia.

Overall, the patient's conditions are complex and require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning yesterday and again this
   morning.  Now stabilized again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are
   concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately alert. Can try
   SBT and possible extubation in PM but need to address code status (do
   not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will continue diuresis with goal 1 L negative today
   --Repeat SBT later today
   - Possible extubation if SBT goes well
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.

   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning yesterday and again this
   morning.  Now stabilized again.  Mucus plug and leukocytosis are
   concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately alert. Can try
   SBT and possible extubation in PM but need to address code status (do
   not re-intubate?) beforehand.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will continue diuresis with goal 1 L negative today
   --Repeat SBT later today
   - Possible extubation if SBT goes well
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  One possibility is that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn
   resistant, or he could have an unpenetrable source somewhere in his
   body.
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - culture if spikes or Leukocytosis increases.  Recently Cdiff
   negative.
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK)/GNR bacteremia: Was most likely septic and
   distributive shock occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as
   well as acute intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of
   bacteria through ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 10 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old gentleman, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and complications. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction (SBO) following a volvulus and colostomy reversal. He developed septic shock, distributive shock, and volume overload, which were managed with fluids and pressors. He was also treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still requires mechanical ventilation. He has a history of poor mental functioning and is currently improving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation. The possibility of reintubation if extubation is attempted is a concern.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and bacteroides infection may indicate a deeper-seated infection, which needs to be addressed.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid overload may lead to further complications, such as heart failure or respiratory distress.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, and his lisinopril medication should be held to allow for diuresis.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to his underlying condition or medication side effects. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure his mental status does not deteriorate further.
6. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO may require further management, including surgical intervention, if the obstruction persists or worsens.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to his underlying condition or medication side effects. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure his blood pressure does not drop further.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilation accordingly.
2. Investigate the patient's leukocytosis and bacteroides infection to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Manage the patient's volume overload by adjusting his fluid intake and diuretic medication.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his hypertension medication as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider surgical intervention for the patient's SBO if the obstruction persists or worsens.
7. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent further hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of ischemic bowel disease, who underwent resection and has been on prolonged ventilation due to marginal medical status. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a SpO2 of 100% on 50% FiO2. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 89/46 mmHg. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, with a failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning. He is also experiencing hypotension and has a small bowel obstruction.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary concerns are:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient failed his SBT this morning and will require further respiratory support. The plan is to reattempt SBT, continue inhalers, and try further diuresis to achieve a goal of 1-1.5 liters of negative fluid balance.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 16.2 K/uL and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Sputum cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin and cefipime. The plan is to scale back antibiotic therapy in the next 1-2 days.
3. Ischemic bowel disease: The patient is at risk for further bowel ischemia and will require close monitoring and management by the surgical team.
4. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain and will require adequate pain management.
5. Skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity and will require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure, particularly if his SBT fails again or if he develops VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and respiratory failure make him at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Bowel perforation: The patient's small bowel obstruction and ischemic bowel disease make him at risk for bowel perforation.
4. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and surgical wounds make him at risk for wound infection.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and respiratory failure make him at risk for cardiovascular instability, particularly if he develops sepsis or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Consider further diuresis to achieve a goal of 1-1.5 liters of negative fluid balance.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy empirically for VAP, pending sputum culture results.
4. Monitor the patient's pain status and adjust pain management as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and manage any wounds or surgical sites carefully.
6. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or gastroenterologist, to further manage the patient's respiratory and bowel status."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning for past several days.
   Bronch yesterday showing thick white secretions. Mucus plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately
   alert.  Need to discuss possibility of trach/reintubation with wife
   today.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now
   --Will hold on diuresis
   --Bronch today to attempt irrigation of thick secretions
   -- continue albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT
   -- may attempt extubation in AM if able to adequately clear left sided
   secretions with bronch
   --Will discuss with wife possible need for trach and ventilator if
   unable tolerate extubation
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn (day [**12-5**]) and vanc/Cipro (day 3) for now
   - reculture if spikes
   - send BAL for culture today
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent surgery to remove ischemic bowel. He has since developed respiratory failure, septic shock, and volume overload. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted.

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, but he experienced acute desaturation following suctioning for the past several days. The bronchoscopy showed thick white secretions, which are concerning for infection. The patient's leukocytosis is stable, and he is being continued on broad antibiotic coverage.

The patient's mental status is altered, and it is unclear if it is due to sedating medications or another cause. His abdominal wound is clean, dry, and intact, but he has an ostomy with yellowish/serosanguinous output. He is at risk for developing a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given his thick secretions and leukocytosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal range. His imaging studies show improvement in his left hemithorax after bronchoscopy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's thick secretions and leukocytosis, he is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and volume overload put him at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if he is not adequately managed.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and thick secretions suggest the possibility of an underlying infection.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but he is at risk for developing an imbalance due to his underlying medical condition and medications.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of kidney injury.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and thick secretions put him at risk for developing pneumonia.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. He is at risk for developing various medical complications, and his care plan should be tailored to address these risks."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning for past several days.
   Bronch yesterday showing thick white secretions. Mucus plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately
   alert.  Need to discuss possibility of trach/reintubation with wife
   today.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will hold on diuresis
   --wean back to PS later today
   --Bronch today to attempt irrigation of thick secretions
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.  Would infection is another
   possibility
 will touch base with surgery
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - will reculture today
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Was most likely septic and distributive shock
   occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well as acute
   intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria through
   ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 11 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and septic, distributive shock. He underwent surgery and had a significant amount of ischemic bowel removed. The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, and leukocytosis.

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, with better respiratory system resistance (RSBI) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels. However, he experienced acute desaturation following suctioning for thick white secretions in the bronchoscopy. The patient's bronchoscopy showed thick white secretions, and suctioning resulted in hypotension, which was treated with a 500cc bolus and flumazenil.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL. His hemoglobin level is 8.0 g/dL, and his platelet count is 348 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 27 mEq/L, and his creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes a volvulus with a colostomy, which was reversed. He has a history of poor mental functioning and has been on sedating medications, which may have contributed to his altered mental status.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, famotidine (Pepcid), furosemide (Lasix), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (Prophylaxis).

The patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, and infection. The patient's respiratory failure may be related to the SBO, and his hypotension may be related to septic and distributive shock. The patient's leukocytosis may be related to infection, and his altered mental status may be related to sedating medications or other underlying medical conditions.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue empiric VAP coverage with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin until the sputum culture is negative.
2. Hold on diuresis and wean back to pressure support later today.
3. Bronch today to attempt irrigation of thick secretions.
4. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider adjusting broad antibiotic coverage if necessary.
5. Discuss the possibility of tracheostomy or reintubation with the patient's wife today.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Consider sending lactate if the patient's abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically.
8. Monitor the patient's ostomy output and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension. He has undergone a bronchoscopy, which revealed thick white secretions and attempted suctioning, but this was followed by hypotension, which responded to a 500cc bolus and flumazenil. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 103/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His respiratory status is being managed with mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. He has a history of small bowel obstruction and is at risk for respiratory failure, hypotension, and shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which could lead to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen, leading to shock, organ dysfunction, or even death.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction could worsen, leading to bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction, failure, or death.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory culture shows yeast growth, which could indicate the presence of pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status.
6. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even death.
7. Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest the possibility of shock, which could lead to organ dysfunction, failure, or death.
8. Intestinal Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction could worsen, leading to bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results. The patient's treatment plan should include aggressive management of his respiratory failure, hypotension, and small bowel obstruction. Additionally, the patient's risk of sepsis, pneumonia, atrial flutter, shock, and intestinal obstruction should be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), who
   presented with LLQ abdominal pain of several days duration and found to
   have SBO, with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel.  [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning for past several days.
   Bronch yesterday showing thick white secretions. Mucus plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately
   alert.  Need to discuss possibility of trach/reintubation with wife
   today.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will hold on diuresis
   --wean back to PS later today
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.  Would infection is another
   possibility
 will touch base with surgery
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - will reculture today
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Was most likely septic and distributive shock
   occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well as acute
   intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria through
   ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 11 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.
   --Appreciate surgery recommendations
   --Send lactate if abdominal exam worsens or patient deteriorates
   hemodynamically
   --immodium started because of large ostomy output; will continue to
   monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   course complicated by septic, distributive shock and now volume
   overload.
 Respiratory failure:  Spontaneously negative yesterday but effusions
   persist on CXR.  Respiratory status improving, with better RSBI but
   then acute desaturation following suctioning for past several days.
   Bronch yesterday showing thick white secretions. Mucus plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection.  Interactive and adequately
   alert.  Need to discuss possibility of trach/reintubation with wife
   today.
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro until sputum cx
   neg
   --Will hold on diuresis
   --wean back to PS later today
 Leukocytosis:  Stable today, and we are continuing broad abx coverage
   as above.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.  Would infection is another
   possibility
 will touch base with surgery
    - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - will reculture today
 HYPOTENSION (SHOCK): Was most likely septic and distributive shock
   occuring due to inflammatory response to surgery as well as acute
   intra-abdominal infection due to translocation of bacteria through
   ischemic bowel.  Now doing well off of pressors.
   --Fluid resuscitate as needed with prn boluses
   --Zosyn empirically to cover bowel flora (today is day 11 of 14)
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who presented with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) with removal of significant amount of ischemic bowel. He developed septic and distributive shock, and now has volume overload. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and has been experiencing acute desaturation following suctioning for the past few days.

The patient has a history of volvulus and colostomy reversal, and his course has been complicated by septic shock, distributive shock, and now volume overload. He has been on empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still experiencing acute desaturation following suctioning. His leukocytosis is stable, and he is continuing broad antibiotic coverage. The possibility of VAP or unpenetrable source of infection is being considered.

The patient's mental status is improving, and he is now interactive and adequately alert. He has a history of poor mental functioning, and his altered mental status is likely due to slow clearance of sedating medications.

The patient's abdominal examination is stable, and he has a large ostomy output. He is on immodium for diarrhea, and his lactate levels are being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's thick white secretions and leukocytosis are concerning for infection, and he is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and low-grade fevers suggest that he may have an underlying infection, which could be related to his SBO or other sources.
3. Volume overload: The patient's fluid overload is a concern, and he may need to be diuresed to prevent further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to his septic and distributive shock, and he may need to be fluid resuscitated to prevent further complications.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to his sedating medications, but it is also possible that he may have an underlying neurological disorder.
6. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's SBO is a concern, and he may need to be managed with bowel rest and antibiotics to prevent further complications.
7. Intestinal ischemia: The patient's ischemic bowel may lead to further complications, such as perforation or abscess formation.
8. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is a concern, and he may need to be managed with antibiotics and supportive care to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with history of volvulus with colostomy subsequently
   reversed now admitted with SBO complicated by ishemic bowel and s/p
   small bowel resection with post op course complicated by septic shock.
   Patient now with persistent respiratory failure (10 days with ETT) with
   altered mental status as well as mucus plugging and hypoxia.
   1)Sepsis-No further positive cultures obtained,
   -Zosyn/Vanco/Cipro
   -BP without need for pressors although patient does have intermittent
   hypotension with sedation and desaturations.
   2)Respiratory Failure-This is most concerning issue and it is an issue
   of altered mental status which is less concerning as well as increase
   impact from inability to clear secretions effectively with recurrent
   collapse of lobar regions.
   -Atrovent/Albuterol
   -Bronch to work to clear left sided secretions today completely
   -Will need to continue suctioning as needed during the day
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro in place
   -Will need to move to SBT to try extubation in am if at all favorable
   -Will discuss with health care proxy (wife) future if unable to
   tolerate extubation and possible need for trach and ventilatory
   dependence.
   3)Small Bowel Obstruction--Patient with persistent drainage from
   abdominal incision site--increased, yellow by report.
   -Follow wound
   -Advance tube feeds
   4)Altered Mental Status-Patient with poor baseline, persistent altered
   mental status
does respond to verbal prompts and will occasionally
   follow commands.
   -Will minimize sedation
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be limiting factor for extubation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with history of volvulus with colostomy subsequently
   reversed now admitted with SBO complicated by ishemic bowel and s/p
   small bowel resection with post op course complicated by septic shock.
   Patient now with persistent respiratory failure (10 days with ETT) with
   altered mental status as well as mucus plugging and hypoxia.
   1)Sepsis-No further positive cultures obtained,
   -Zosyn/Vanco/Cipro
   -BP without need for pressors although patient does have intermittent
   hypotension with sedation and desaturations.
   2)Respiratory Failure-This is most concerning issue and it is an issue
   of altered mental status which is less concerning as well as increase
   impact from inability to clear secretions effectively with recurrent
   collapse of lobar regions.
   -Atrovent/Albuterol
   -Bronch to work to clear left sided secretions today completely
   -Will need to continue suctioning as needed during the day
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro in place
   -Will need to move to SBT to try extubation in am if at all favorable
   -Will discuss with health care proxy (wife) future if unable to
   tolerate extubation and possible need for trach and ventilatory
   dependence.
   3)Small Bowel Obstruction--Patient with persistent drainage from
   abdominal incision site--increased, yellow by report.
   -Follow wound
   -Advance tube feeds
   4)Altered Mental Status-Patient with poor baseline, persistent altered
   mental status
does respond to verbal prompts and will occasionally
   follow commands.
   -Will minimize sedation
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be limiting factor for extubation.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of volvulus, colostomy reversal, and subsequent small bowel resection, complicated by septic shock, small bowel obstruction, and bowel ischemia.
* The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, sepsis, and altered mental status.
* The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.1°C, heart rate 77-104 beats per minute, blood pressure 96/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* The patient has a small bowel obstruction with persistent drainage from the abdominal incision site, and the wound is being followed.
* The patient is receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin, and has had no further positive cultures obtained.
* The patient is also receiving respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation and bronchodilators, and has had recurrent desaturations and hypotension overnight.
* The patient's mental status is altered, and they respond to verbal prompts and occasionally follow commands.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis could lead to organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular failure.
3. Small bowel obstruction-related complications: The patient's small bowel obstruction could lead to further complications, including bowel perforation, abscess formation, or fistula development.
4. Bowel ischemia-related complications: The patient's bowel ischemia could lead to further complications, including bowel necrosis, perforation, or fistula development.
5. Altered mental status-related complications: The patient's altered mental status could lead to further complications, including falls, pressure ulcers, or respiratory complications.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis could lead to further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and further deterioration could lead to malnutrition, weakness, or organ dysfunction.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent these potential complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with ongoing respiratory failure, acute hypotension, and small bowel obstruction. The patient has been mechanically ventilated with CPAP/PSV mode, with a recent RSBI of 75. The patient's respiratory culture is negative, and the BAL prelim is pending. The patient's pain is being managed with IV hydromorphone and midazolam. The patient's electrolyte and blood glucose levels are within normal limits. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the Hct is slightly decreased. The patient's platelet count is normal. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure may lead to further decline in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring more aggressive respiratory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction may lead to further complications such as bowel necrosis, perforation, or fistula formation, requiring surgical intervention.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and positive blood culture may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory culture is negative, but the presence of yeast in the BAL may indicate the presence of pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory decline.
5. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension may lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, shock, or even cardiac arrest.
6. Pain management: The patient's pain is being managed with IV hydromorphone and midazolam, but the patient may require more aggressive pain management or alternative analgesics to prevent further complications.
7. Nutritional support: The patient is receiving TPN with lipids, but the patient may require more aggressive nutritional support or alternative nutritional sources to prevent malnutrition and related complications.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits, but the patient may require more aggressive glycemic control to prevent hyperglycemia and related complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), found
   to have SBO, with large amounts of necrotic bowel emergently removed.
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock, and failure to
   wean from vent.
 Respiratory failure:  Bronch with removal of copioius secretions, and
   subsequent CXR showing much improvement.  Although mucous plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection, nothing has grown so far.
   Interactive and adequately alert.  Family meeting yesterday; will try
   to extubate once more this afternoon
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now, though
   may discontinue if no evidence for infection
   --Continue albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT
   --Attempt extubation once more this afternoon; again stress possibility
   of trach with wife.
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Trending down today, but still elevated above
   baseline.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn (day [**1-4**]) and vanc/Cipro (day 4) for now
   - reculture if spikes
   - send BAL for culture today
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), found
   to have SBO, with large amounts of necrotic bowel emergently removed.
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock, and failure to
   wean from vent.
 Respiratory failure:  Bronch with removal of copioius secretions, and
   subsequent CXR showing much improvement.  Although mucous plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection, nothing has grown so far.
   Interactive and adequately alert.  Family meeting yesterday; will try
   to extubate once more this afternoon
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now, though
   may discontinue if no evidence for infection
   --Continue albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT
   --Attempt extubation once more this afternoon; again stress possibility
   of trach with wife.
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Trending down today, but still elevated above
   baseline.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn (day [**1-4**]) and vanc/Cipro (day 4) for now
   - reculture if spikes
   - send BAL for culture today
 Altered Mental Status: Per wife and surgeons, patient with baseline
   poor mental functioning.  CT head did not show any clear cause of
   continued sedation.   Likely was altered due to slow clearance of
   sedating medications, currently improving.
   - will continue to monitor
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS):
   Patient presented with feculent vomitus and LLQ abdominal pain. Likely
   developed in setting of prior abdominal surgeries due to volvulus and
   colostomy in past.  Cdiff negative.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent emergent removal of necrotic bowel.
* He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
* He has a history of volvulus and colostomy, which may have contributed to the development of SBO.
* He is being treated for septic shock and distributive shock.
* He has a leukocytosis, which may be related to infection or other factors.
* He has a history of altered mental status, which is improving.
* He has a large ostomy output and is being treated with immodium.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's thick secretions and leukocytosis make him at risk for VAP. The patient's current treatment with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin may need to be continued or modified based on the results of the respiratory culture.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and low-grade fevers may indicate an ongoing infection. The patient's blood culture has grown Bacteroides fragilis group, which is beta-lactamase positive. Further cultures and sensitivities are needed to determine the best course of treatment.
* Small bowel obstruction: The patient's SBO may recur or worsen if not managed properly. The patient's current treatment with TPN and immodium may need to be adjusted based on his ostomy output and abdominal exam.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may need to be managed with medication, particularly given his history of poor mental functioning.
* Wound complications: The patient's necrotic bowel and SBO may increase his risk of wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's TPN and immodium may need to be adjusted based on his nutritional needs and ostomy output.

**Plan:**

* Continue empiric VAP coverage with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for now.
* Continue albuterol and Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT.
* Attempt extubation once more this afternoon.
* Follow up on the sensitivities of the Bacteroides culture.
* Continue Zosyn and Vanc/Cipro for now.
* Reculture if spikes.
* Send BAL for culture today.
* Monitor the patient's abdominal exam and ostomy output.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status.
* Consider sending lactate if the patient's abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically."

   87 yo gentleman with h/o volvulus s/p colostomy (since reversed), found
   to have SBO, with large amounts of necrotic bowel emergently removed.
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] course complicated by septic, distributive shock, and failure to
   wean from vent.
 Respiratory failure:  Bronch with removal of copioius secretions, and
   subsequent CXR showing much improvement.  Although mucous plug and
   leukocytosis are concerning for infection, nothing has grown so far.
   Interactive and alert.  Family meeting yesterday; will try to extubate
   this morning
   --Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now, though
   may discontinue if no evidence for infection
   --Continue albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT
   --Attempt extubation once more this afternoon; again stress possibility
   of trach with wife.
   .
 Leukocytosis:  Trending down today, but still elevated above
   baseline.  Patient could have VAP given thick secretions and
   leukocytosis (also having low grade fevers). Another possibility is
   that the bacteroides from [**1-8**] is Zosyn resistant, or he could have an
   unpenetrable source somewhere in his body.
   - f/u sensitivities of bacteroides culture.
   - continue zosyn and vanc/cipro for now
   - reculture if spikes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of volvulus and colostomy, who was found to have small bowel obstruction (SBO) with necrotic bowel emergently removed. He was admitted to the ICU with septic, distributive shock, and failure to wean from the ventilator.

Current status:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has bronch with removal of copious secretions, and the CXR shows much improvement.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocyte count is trending down, but still elevated above baseline, which could be indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or another underlying infection.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving, but he has baseline poor mental functioning.
* Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of SBO, including intussusception, and has undergone surgery to remove necrotic bowel.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is being treated with medication.

Potential medical complications:

* VAP: The patient's leukocytosis and bronch with copious secretions could be indicative of VAP.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and distributive shock could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
* Infection: The patient's elevated leukocyte count and presence of bacteroides in his blood culture could indicate an underlying infection.
* Bowel obstruction: The patient's history of SBO and ongoing symptoms could lead to further bowel obstruction if not properly managed.
* Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure could lead to further complications if not properly managed.

Plan:

* Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vanco and Cipro for now, though may discontinue if no evidence for infection.
* Continue albuterol/Atrovent MDIs and aggressive suctioning, chest PT.
* Attempt extubation once more this afternoon, and stress the possibility of tracheostomy with the patient's wife.
* Follow BAL cultures and reculture if spikes.
* Monitor the patient's leukocyte count and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and small bowel obstruction.
* Consider sending lactate if the patient's abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically."

   Wife in to communicate patient wishes--she notes that son has been
   updated, she has had time off from work and would agree with patient
   moving to extubation without plans for re-intubation as current plan of
   care given the fact that patient would require tracheostomy and be very
   unlikely to return to independent life at home where baseline status,

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with initial admission with SBO and now has had significant
   bowel necrosis now s/p removal and with persistent respiratory failure
   in the setting of recurrent lung collapse.  He has had bronchoscopy
   with improvement in infiltrates.  He has increased alertness through
   this morning.  He has had extensive course with antibiotics with known
   pathogens treated.  He has an improved RSBI this morning and has been
   able to tolerate PSV at 5/5 for 3 hours this morning
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has had 12 days on ventilator and may be
   limited by weakness but does have modifiable variables treated
   maximally to date.  We have had extensive discussions with his wife in
   regards to possible next steps.
   -He has had some improvement in secretion volume but will have
   continued need to work to clear secretions with chest PT and suctioning
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro to continue for treatment
   -Will have patient sitting up, sedation off, tube feeds held prior to
   extubation
   -We have been clear that patient may do well off of ventilatory support
   given that this is a reasonably optimal window for trial, but that
   decline is certainly possible.  With tracheostomy and chronic rehab
   making return to what was only borderline meaningful existence to the
   patient not reasonable to expect, should patient decline would move to
   CMO for support.
   -Will discuss in detail with surgical team prior to extubation given
   plan not to re-intubate
   2)SBO--S/P Resection-
   -Continue with antibiotics as described above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Wife in to communicate patient wishes--she notes that son has been
   updated, she has had time off from work and would agree with patient
   moving to extubation without plans for re-intubation as current plan of
   care given the fact that patient would require tracheostomy and be very
   unlikely to return to independent life at home where baseline status,
   which is not likely to be returned to, had significant impairment.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and small bowel obstruction (SBO). He has undergone resection of the SBO and has had significant bowel necrosis. He has been on ventilator support for 12 days and has had recurrent lung collapse. He has been treated with antibiotics for known pathogens and has shown some improvement in respiratory function. His wife has been consulted and agrees to extubation without plans for re-intubation, as the patient would require tracheostomy and is unlikely to return to independent life at home.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is still impaired, and he may experience further decline if not managed properly. He may require continued respiratory support, and the team should monitor his condition closely.
2. SBO: The patient's SBO has been resected, but he may still be at risk for complications such as infection, obstruction, or perforation.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired due to his underlying medical conditions, and he may be at risk for further complications such as pressure ulcers or skin infections.
4. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, and he may require ongoing management to control his symptoms.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk for further hypotension or shock.
6. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, and he may be at risk for further arrhythmias or cardiac complications.
7. Shock: The patient is at risk for shock due to his underlying medical conditions, and he may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent shock.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-kg adult in the ICU with a history of pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP), impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute and chronic), respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), small bowel obstruction (including intussusception and adhesions), and atrial flutter. The patient was extubated and is currently on facemask with FIO2 of 35%. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and they are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show a decreasing hemoglobin count (Hct) and a trending down hematocrit (Hct). The white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, and the platelet count is decreasing. The liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, and the renal function tests (RFTs) are within normal limits. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the urine culture is negative.

The patient's imaging studies show partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe, small-to-moderate left pleural effusion, and minor atelectasis at the right base.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's decreasing platelet count and elevated PT/PTT/INR values may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and pending blood cultures may indicate a bacterial infection, which could worsen their condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's small bowel obstruction and intussusception may lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter may progress to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias, which could worsen their condition.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to receive enteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition and related complications.
7. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, or other skin-related complications.
8. Pain management: The patient's acute and chronic pain may not be adequately managed, leading to discomfort, anxiety, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent emergent removal of necrotic bowel. He was initially intubated and ventilated, but was extubated yesterday and is currently on facemask with FIO2 of 35%. He has been experiencing leukocytosis, which is trending down, but is still elevated above baseline. He also has a positive guaiac stool test and decreasing hemoglobin count. He is receiving empiric VAP coverage with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin, and his blood cultures are pending. His mental status is altered, but is improving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's positive guaiac stool test and decreasing hemoglobin count suggest that he may be at risk for VAP.
2. Ischemic bowel: The patient's SBO and necrotic bowel removal may have caused ischemia to the remaining bowel, which could lead to further complications.
3. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and leukocytosis suggest that he may have an infection, which could worsen his condition.
4. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's decreasing hemoglobin count and positive guaiac stool test suggest that he may be at risk for hypovolemic shock.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and difficulty weaning from the ventilator may lead to further complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and his need for TPN may lead to malnutrition, which could worsen his condition.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen his condition and increase his risk of complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric VAP coverage with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin until blood cultures are negative.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin count and transfuse as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide aggressive suctioning and chest physical therapy as needed.
4. Consider sending a lactate level if the patient's abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and provide pain management as needed.
6. Consider restarting tube feeds and providing nutritional support as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and provide glycemic control as needed.
8. Continue to provide prophylactic antibiotics and stress ulcer prophylaxis as needed.
9. Consider sending a stat CT scan of the abdomen if the patient's abdominal exam worsens or he deteriorates hemodynamically."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old gentleman, was admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and underwent emergent removal of necrotic bowel. He developed septic shock, distributive shock, and difficulty weaning from ventilation. He was recently extubated and is currently on facemask with FIO2 of 35%. His vital signs are stable, but he has guaiac-positive stool and decreasing hemoglobin levels. He is also experiencing leukocytosis, which may be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or an unpenetrable source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's guaiac-positive stool and leukocytosis may indicate VAP. Empiric coverage with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin is ongoing, and the patient's cultures will be monitored for sensitivities.
2. Intestinal obstruction: The patient's SBO may recur, and the patient may require further surgical intervention.
3. Hemorrhage: The patient's decreasing hemoglobin levels may indicate bleeding, which could be due to his underlying medical conditions or the recent surgical procedure.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and guaiac-positive stool may indicate an ongoing infection, which could be due to VAP or an unpenetrable source of infection.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require further management, and his home medication, lisinopril, has been held.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's poor mental functioning may be due to his underlying medical conditions, and his improving mental status may be a sign of recovery.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric coverage for VAP with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.
2. Monitor the patient's cultures for sensitivities and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. Continue to trend the patient's hemoglobin levels and consider transfusing blood if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's stool output and consider sending a lactate if abdominal exam worsens or the patient deteriorates hemodynamically.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension and consider restarting lisinopril if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider adjusting his medication regimen if necessary.
7. Continue to provide pain management with PO oxycodone and IV dilaudid.
8. Consider sending a lactate to rule out ischemic bowel disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male who was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and respiratory failure. The patient was successfully extubated after aggressive pulmonary toilet and ETT removal yesterday.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/54 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 16.2 K/uL, and the platelet count is 535 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 24 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 18 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies show worsening left lower lobe (LLL) and right lower lobe (RLL) collapse on chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP):
	* Continue antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro) for an 8-day course.
	* Continue humidified air to facilitate secretion clearance.
	* Continue chest physical therapy (PT) as possible, with intermittent suction.
	* Follow up bacteroides for final sensitivities.
	* Out-of-bed (OOB) as possible.
2. Small bowel obstruction (SBO):
	* Work to place a feeding tube given limited capacity to tolerate oral intake.
	* Start tube feeds today.
	* Further wound management per surgical team.
3. Shock, other:
	* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
4. Atrial flutter:
	* Monitor and manage as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. This may indicate respiratory muscle fatigue or pneumonia.
* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP), and chest X-ray shows worsening LLL and RLL collapse.
* Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of SBO, which can lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.
* Shock: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the patient has a history of shock.
* Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."
