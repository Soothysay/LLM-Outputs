You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male who was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and gastric and esophageal varices. He had a recent episode of bleeding and was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/45 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 91% on room air.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis, varices, and possible EtOH abuse. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, and platelet count of 150 K/uL. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 72 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase level of 109 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* UGIB, varices, and cirrhosis: receive 2 units of packed red blood cells, follow hemoglobin levels, and continue octreotide and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis.
* Renal insufficiency: follow up on renal function.
* Hypothyroidism: continue thyroid hormone supplementation.
* ICU care: monitor vital signs, maintain glycemic control, and provide prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further bleeding from varices
* Development of respiratory failure
* Sepsis from pneumonia or other infections
* Renal failure from inadequate perfusion
* Liver failure from cirrhosis
* Cardiac complications from hypotension or other factors

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and cirrhosis. He had a previous episode of bleeding and was stabilized with blood transfusions and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. However, he had another episode of bleeding today, and a repeat endoscopy showed fresh blood in the stomach and varices. He was transferred to the ICU for further management and consideration for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/45 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 91%. His physical examination is notable for mild erythema on the right lower extremity.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, and platelet count of 150 K/uL. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 72 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase level of 109 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Re-bleeding: The patient's varices are still present, and he has had multiple episodes of bleeding. There is a high risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and his creatinine level is elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. This could progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 91%, which is slightly low. He may require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation if his oxygenation worsens.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has been receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is mildly impaired, and he may be at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to altered mental status and decreased responsiveness.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at 1.2, which could increase his risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, and he may be at risk of malnutrition, particularly if he is unable to tolerate enteral nutrition."

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to gastric and esophageal varices. He was admitted to the ICU after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was stabilized on pantoprazole (Protonix) and octreotide. However, he had another episode of bleeding today, and a repeat EGD showed varices with fresh blood in the stomach. The patient is being considered for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/45 mmHg. He has a blood loss anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL and is receiving ongoing treatment with octreotide and ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient's varices are still bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver disease and bleeding may increase the risk of coagulopathy, which could worsen bleeding and increase the risk of intracranial bleeding.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's cirrhosis and bleeding may increase the risk of acute kidney injury, which could worsen his overall condition.
4. Infection: The patient's cirrhosis and bleeding may increase the risk of infection, particularly with gram-negative bacteria, which could worsen his condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's cirrhosis and bleeding may increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if he develops pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and bleeding may increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen his mental status and increase the risk of complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cirrhosis and bleeding may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to gastric varices. He has a history of recurrent variceal bleed and was transferred from another hospital for consideration of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient has been experiencing tarry stools, but the bleeding has stabilized, and his hemoglobin (Hct) level is 30%. He is currently being managed with octreotide, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebound bleed: The patient's bleeding has stabilized, but there is a risk of rebound bleed with portal hypertension. Close monitoring of his hemoglobin levels and platelet count is necessary.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4, and he has a history of acute kidney injury. Monitoring of his creatinine level and urine output is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 135, which is below normal. Close monitoring of his platelet count and consideration of transfusion for active bleeding are necessary.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is low-normal. Levothyroxine therapy is necessary to maintain euthyroidism.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of short intubation course and hoarse voice. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and consideration of ENT evaluation are necessary.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of unclear duration of antibiotics at the previous hospital, and he is at risk of developing infections.
7. Malnutrition: The patient has been NPO for several days, and he is at risk of malnutrition. Close monitoring of his nutrition and consideration of advancing his diet are necessary.
8. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, and close monitoring of his fluid status is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue octreotide, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone therapy.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and platelet count closely.
3. Trend the patient's creatinine level and urine output.
4. Consider transfusion for active bleeding.
5. Continue levothyroxine therapy.
6. Consider ENT evaluation for hoarse voice.
7. Monitor the patient's nutrition and consider advancing his diet.
8. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely.
9. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis.
10. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed (melena). The patient has been receiving treatment with octreotide, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their SpO2 is 93%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and their abdomen is soft and non-tender. The patient's skin shows mild, poorly defined erythema on the left lower extremity, but no tenderness. The patient's neurologic examination is nonfocal, with no asterixis.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a slight increase in neutrophils. The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, and their platelet count is within normal range. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may continue to worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or other bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and slight increase in neutrophils may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's slightly elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which could lead to further complications if not addressed.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level may require close monitoring to prevent cardiac arrhythmias or other electrolyte-related complications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation, and close monitoring of their respiratory status is essential to prevent respiratory complications.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's nonfocal neurologic examination may indicate a risk of neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke, if not closely monitored and managed.
7. DVT or VAP: The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase their risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which could lead to further complications if not prevented or treated promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and a history of recurrent variceal bleeding. He was transferred to the ICU for consideration of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a hematocrit of 30% and no active bleeding seen on endoscopy. However, he has had multiple episodes of dark stool overnight, which may be residual bleeding. He is being treated with octreotide, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone, and is being monitored for bleeding and portal hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show mild impairment of synthetic function, with an INR of 1.2 and albumin of 2.8 g/dL. His MELD score is 12, indicating a moderate level of liver dysfunction.

The patient's other medical conditions include LE edema, which is likely due to hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension, and ARF, which is possible but not severe. He also has thrombocytopenia, which is likely related to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a hoarse voice, which is likely due to recent intubation and dry mouth. He also has mild, poorly defined erythema on his left lower extremity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient's recent history of variceal bleeding and the presence of gastric varices on endoscopy make rebleeding a significant risk.
2. Portal hypertension: The patient's liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension increase the risk of bleeding and other complications.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's ARF and liver dysfunction make hepatorenal syndrome a possible complication.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding and other complications.
5. LE edema: The patient's LE edema can worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as cellulitis and deep vein thrombosis.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 81-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital 10 days ago with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and hematemesis. He was found to have esophageal and gastric varices during an endoscopy and was extubated 2 days later. He was transferred to a different hospital and was admitted to the MICU due to an episode of bleeding and a dropping hematocrit. He has had three episodes of maroon stool since admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/55 mmHg. He is receiving octreotide to control his bleeding and pantoprazole to prevent stress ulcers.

The patient has a history of heavy ethanol use, left lower extremity edema, hypothyroidism, and a left thyroid nodule. He is taking several medications, including synthroid, spiriva, and flovent.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hematocrit of 30.4%. His liver function tests are elevated, with an ALT of 38 and an AST of 54. His coagulation studies show a prolonged PT and PTT.

The patient's assessment is that he has a variceal bleed, which has responded to 2 units of packed red blood cells. He is at risk for further bleeding and has a high risk of developing acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and death
* Acute renal failure, which could lead to chronic kidney disease and require dialysis
* Infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Liver failure, which could lead to death
* Respiratory failure, which could lead to death
* Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure, which could lead to death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and a history of recurrent variceal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU for TIPS evaluation and management of his upper GI bleed.

The patient's condition has been stable, with a hemodynamically stable blood pressure and a stable hematocrit in the low thirties. However, he has experienced intermittent episodes of maroon stool and had an episode of BRBPR (150cc) with positive NGT lavage, which suggests ongoing upper GI bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, and a low albumin level, which is consistent with cirrhosis. His INR is elevated, and his MELD score is 13, indicating mildly impaired synthetic function.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bibasilar crackles and mild pulmonary edema on imaging, which is likely due to volume overload. He also has peripheral edema, which may be related to hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 147, which is likely due to decreased access to free water in the setting of NPO. His creatinine level is trending down to baseline, and his urine lytes suggest an intra-renal process.

The patient's platelet count is low, which is likely related to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration. He also has a history of thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding is a concern, and further management is needed to prevent further bleeding and complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and further management is needed to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload is likely contributing to his respiratory distress and may lead to further complications if not managed.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium level is elevated, and further management is needed to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is trending down to baseline, but further management is needed to prevent acute kidney injury.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and further management is needed to prevent bleeding complications.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and further management is needed to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.

In summary, the patient's condition is stable, but he requires further management to prevent complications. His upper GI bleeding needs to be closely monitored, and his respiratory status requires further management to prevent respiratory failure. His electrolyte imbalance needs to be addressed, and his platelet count needs to be monitored to prevent bleeding complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and a history of recurrent variceal bleeding. He was transferred to the ICU for TIPS evaluation after experiencing an upper GI bleed, with intermittent maroon stools and an episode of BRBPR with positive NGT lavage. The patient is currently NPO, with active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units, and monitoring of HCT every 6 hours. He is receiving octreotide, IV PPI, and ceftriaxone, and is being held on nadolol due to active GI bleed.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has had recurrent variceal bleeding, and is currently experiencing intermittent maroon stools and an episode of BRBPR with positive NGT lavage.
2. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of portal hypertension, with gastric and esophageal varices, and mildly impaired synthetic function.
3. Shortness of breath: The patient has peripheral edema, bibasilar crackles, and mild pulmonary edema on imaging, consistent with volume overload.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated to 147, likely due to decreased access to free water in setting of NPO.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and urine lytes suggest an intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely related to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to the presence of varices and the fact that he is still NPO.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his compromised immune system and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's shortness of breath and mild pulmonary edema on imaging put him at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening.
5. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and the presence of a nasogastric tube put him at risk for sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding due to the presence of varices and the fact that he is still NPO.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury puts him at risk for further decline in renal function, which can be life-threatening."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient has been experiencing intermittent episodes of maroon stool, which has led to a discussion with the liver service and a plan for TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) today. The patient has also been complaining of increasing shortness of breath, possibly more stridorous, with crackles at the bases, which has been treated with IVF discontinuation, 20mg of lasix, and humidified oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
* Heart rate: 67 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 125/39 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 90%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 180 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 7.4 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL
* International normalized ratio (INR): 1.3
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 25.3 seconds
* Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 14.9 seconds

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Alert and oriented with no acute distress
* Sclera anicteric, mucous membranes dry, oropharynx clear
* Supple neck, regular heart rhythm, and normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Soft abdomen, positive bowel sounds
* No jaundice, spider angiomas, or palmar erythema
* Non-focal neurological examination

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Hepatic encephalopathy due to portosystemic shunting
* Respiratory failure due to volume overload and potential aspiration
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines
* Malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition and potential gastrointestinal bleeding
* Electrolyte imbalance due to diuretic therapy and potential gastrointestinal losses

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

 BRONCHOSCOPY - At [**2107-3-2**] 05:04 PM
   - Patient went for TIPS.  Very difficult airway/intubation that
   required fiberoptic intubation.  Noted a large amount of thick
   secretions during intubation.  Underwent TIPS with moderate blood
   loss.  Briefly started on neosynephrine while in procedure, but able to
   be easily weaned once back in MICU.
   - Had bedside bronchoscopy to evaluated for thick secretions; saw only
   thin secretions though copious fresh blood around the vocal cords with
   edema.  Pt remained intubated for the night and will likely re-bronch
   in the morning prior to extubation.
   - had hypotension after starting propofol for sedation - started on
   neosynephrine and have been weaning as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and last night episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit in the low
   thirties.  Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS
   procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (no
   course yet set)
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - SBT this morning; will attempt extubation today
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -humidified O2/ice chips with improvement of hoarseness
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 147 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - 100cc D5W for 1 liter
   - trend sodium Q8hr
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], now increased again to 1.6.
   Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.
   Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in TIPS
   procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Restart Lasix
   - trend creatinine [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**]. Possible infectious etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now improved to 241. Likely related to
   cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and a history of recurrent variceal bleed. He was admitted to the ICU after a recent episode of upper GI bleed and underwent a TIPS procedure. He had a difficult airway during intubation, requiring fiberoptic intubation, and was found to have fresh blood and edema around the vocal cords. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a plan to attempt extubation today.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Upper GI bleed: He has had intermittent maroon stools and a recent episode of BRBPR, and is being treated with octreotide and PPI.
* Respiratory failure: He required intubation for the TIPS procedure and has bibasilar crackles and mild pulmonary edema on imaging.
* Liver cirrhosis: He has mildly impaired synthetic function and elevated INR and low albumin, and is being evaluated for potential etiologies.
* Shortness of breath: He has peripheral edema, bibasilar crackles, and mild pulmonary edema on imaging, and is being treated with ipratropium and albuterol nebs.
* Hypernatremia: His sodium level is elevated, likely due to decreased access to free water while NPO.
* Acute renal failure: His creatinine level is elevated, and he is being treated with IVF and Lasix.
* Thrombocytopenia: His platelet count is low, likely related to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration.
* Increased WBC: His white blood cell count is elevated, and he is being evaluated for possible infectious etiology.

Potential medical complications:

* Upper GI bleed: The patient may continue to experience bleeding, and may require further interventions such as endoscopy or surgery.
* Respiratory failure: The patient may experience respiratory distress or failure, and may require further interventions such as mechanical ventilation.
* Liver cirrhosis: The patient's liver function may continue to deteriorate, and he may require further interventions such as liver transplantation.
* Shortness of breath: The patient may experience worsening respiratory symptoms, and may require further interventions such as oxygen therapy or diuretics.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level may continue to be elevated, and he may require further interventions such as fluid restriction or diuretics.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function may continue to deteriorate, and he may require further interventions such as dialysis.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to be low, and he may require further interventions such as platelet transfusions.
* Increased WBC: The patient may have an underlying infectious process, and may require further interventions such as antibiotics or surgical drainage."

   loss.  Briefly started on neosynephrine while in procedure, but able to
   be easily weaned once back in MICU.
   - Had bedside bronchoscopy to evaluated for thick secretions; saw only
   thin secretions though copious fresh blood around the vocal cords with
   edema.  Pt remained intubated for the night and will likely re-bronch
   in the morning prior to extubation.
   - had hypotension after starting propofol for sedation - started on
   neosynephrine and have been weaning as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS.
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and last night episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit in the low
   thirties.  Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS
   procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18)
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - SBT this morning
   - repeat bronchoscopy; if stable will extubate today.
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -humidified O2/ice chips with improvement of hoarseness
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 147 this AM likely due to decreased
   access to free water in setting of NPO
   - 100cc D5W for 1 liter
   - trend sodium Q8hr
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load yesterday.  Urine lytes suggest
   intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.  Likely contrast
   nephropathy due to increased dye load in TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF
   - trend creatinine [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now improved to 241. Likely related to
   cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Cont levothyroxine
   .
   # Thyroid nodule: Continue outpatient monitoring
   .
   # FEN:  IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and a history of recurrent variceal bleeding. He has undergone a TIPS procedure and is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of recurrent variceal bleeding and has recently had an episode of BRBPR and hematemesis. He is currently NPO and receiving octreotide and PPI.
* Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for the TIPS procedure and has a difficult airway. He is likely to be easily weaned from the vent, but a bedside bronchoscopy revealed fresh blood and edema around the vocal cords, likely due to traumatic intubation attempts.
* Liver cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of portal hypertension and mildly impaired synthetic function. He has elevated INR and low albumin levels, and his MELD score is 13.
* Shortness of breath: The patient has peripheral edema, bibasilar crackles, and mild pulmonary edema on imaging, consistent with volume overload. He also has a history of COPD and anemia, which may be contributing to his shortness of breath.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated to 147, likely due to decreased access to free water in the setting of NPO.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine level has been trending down to baseline, but increased to 1.7 following a contrast load during the TIPS procedure. Urine lytes suggest an intra-renal process with negative eosinophils, likely due to contrast nephropathy.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved from 114 to 241, likely due to cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient is currently taking levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Upper GI bleed: The patient's history of recurrent variceal bleeding and current episode of BRBPR and hematemesis put him at risk for further bleeding.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's difficult airway and need for intubation increase his risk for respiratory complications.
* Liver cirrhosis: The patient's mildly impaired synthetic function and elevated INR and low albumin levels put him at risk for further liver decompensation.
* Shortness of breath: The patient's volume overload, anemia, and COPD put him at risk for further respiratory compromise.
* Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium level puts him at risk for further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
* ARF: The patient's contrast nephropathy and intra-renal process put him at risk for further kidney damage.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count puts him at risk for bleeding complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* NPO for now
* Active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
* Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
* Octreotide gtt
* IV PPI
* Continue ceftriaxone
* Hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
* Hepatology recs
* SBT this morning
* Repeat bronchoscopy; if stable, extubate today
* Trend creatinine
* Trend platelet count
* Consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
* Continue levothyroxine
* Continue outpatient monitoring of thyroid nodule
* IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and last night episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit in the low
   thirties.  Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS
   procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (no
   course yet set)
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - SBT this morning; will attempt extubation today
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -humidified O2/ice chips with improvement of hoarseness
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 147 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - 100cc D5W for 1 liter
   - trend sodium Q8hr
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], now increased again to 1.6.
   Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative eosinophils.
   Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in TIPS
   procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Restart Lasix
   - trend creatinine [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**]. Possible infectious etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now improved to 241. Likely related to
   cirrhosis/splenic sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Cont levothyroxine
   .
   # Thyroid nodule: Continue outpatient monitoring
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleed, who underwent a TIPS procedure. The patient's condition has been complicated by upper GI bleed, respiratory failure, liver cirrhosis, shortness of breath, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, increased WBC, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, and thyroid nodule.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure of 125/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals a normal neurological examination, with no signs of jaundice, spider angiomas, or palmar erythema.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, and platelet count of 241 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an INR of 1.7, ALT of 37, and AST of 28. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, recurrent variceal bleed, COPD, and hypothyroidism. The patient's medications include octreotide, phenylephrine, propofol, pantoprazole, furosemide, and levothyroxine.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of recurrent variceal bleed and has had intermittent maroon stools and a recent episode of BRBPR.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for the TIPS procedure and has a difficult airway. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with bibasilar crackles and mild pulmonary edema on imaging.
3. Liver cirrhosis: The patient's liver function is impaired, with an INR of 1.7, ALT of 37, and AST of 28. The patient's MELD score is 13.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.6 mg/dL, likely due to contrast nephropathy.
5. Increased WBC: The patient's WBC count is elevated, with a possible infectious etiology.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely related to cirrhosis and splenic sequestration.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function is abnormal, with a hypothyroidism diagnosis.
8. Thyroid nodule: The patient has a thyroid nodule, which is being monitored.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. NPO status
2. Active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
3. Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
4. Octreotide gtt
5. IV PPI
6. Continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed
7. Continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
8. Hepatology recs
9. SBT this morning; will attempt extubation today
10. Consider additional imaging with CT when patient stable
11. Continue ipratropium nebs prn
12. Continue albuterol nebs prn
13. Humidified O2/ice chips with improvement of hoarseness
14. Consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
15. Cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume status/oxygen requirement
16. Hold nephrotoxins
17. Renally dose medication
18. Continue IVF, monitor UOP
19. Restart Lasix
20. Trend creatinine
21. Add on diff to CBC
22. Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
23. Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
24. Trend platelet count
25. Consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
26. Continue levothyroxine
27. Continue outpatient monitoring for thyroid nodule
28. IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
29. Pneumoboots
30. PIV, PICC

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with cirrhosis, who underwent a TIPS procedure and was intubated during the procedure. He required low-dose propofol for sedation overnight and was extubated this morning. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is also experiencing respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and leukocytosis.

Assessment:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, and his respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute. His ventilator settings are set at 500 mL, with a pressure support of 5 cmH2O.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB, and is currently experiencing melena. He is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and octreotide infusions to manage his bleeding.
* Cirrhosis/Variceal bleed: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and he is at risk for further bleeding. He is receiving octreotide infusions to manage his bleeding.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage. He is receiving furosemide (Lasix) infusions to manage his fluid overload.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he is at risk for infection. He is receiving antibiotics to manage his infection.

Plan:

* Respiratory failure: The patient will be extubated and monitored for respiratory distress.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient will continue to receive pantoprazole and octreotide infusions to manage his bleeding.
* Cirrhosis/Variceal bleed: The patient will continue to receive octreotide infusions to manage his bleeding.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient will continue to receive furosemide infusions to manage his fluid overload.
* Leukocytosis: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics to manage his infection.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory distress, including pneumonia and respiratory arrest.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Cirrhosis/Variceal bleed: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding and lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient is at risk for further kidney damage, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
* Leukocytosis: The patient is at risk for further infection, including sepsis and septic shock."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - NPO for now
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT Q8hr and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (no
   course yet set)
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure.
   Monitor LFTs daily.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Restart Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Respiratory failure likely due to traumatic intubation attempts
* Upper GI bleed with intermittent maroon stools and positive NGT lavage
* Marked transaminitis likely due to TIPS procedure, with elevated LFTs
* Hypernatremia likely due to decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to contrast nephropathy
* Thrombocytopenia likely related to cirrhosis/splenic sequestration
* Increased WBC count with possible infectious etiology

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Upper GI bleed with ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding
* Respiratory failure with potential need for re-intubation
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function
* AKI with potential need for dialysis
* Sepsis or infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state
* Thrombocytopenia with potential for bleeding or thrombosis
* Hypothyroidism with potential need for medication adjustment

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - Advance diet as tolerated (sips)
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (day 1 =
   [**2-28**] for empiric 5 day course to end [**3-5**])
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent for
   humidification and oxygenation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - Start lactulose
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure and/or
   shock liver.  Monitor LFTs daily; follow-up with liver team.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count daily
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and recurrent variceal bleed. He underwent a TIPS procedure and was intubated for the procedure. He was extubated on [**2107-3-3**] and is currently on face tent for humidification and oxygenation. The patient has a history of upper GI bleed, and his lab results show elevated INR, low albumin, and mildly impaired synthetic function. He also has mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar crackles.

Potential medical complications:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of upper GI bleed and is currently receiving prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's lab results show elevated INR, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for the TIPS procedure and has a history of respiratory failure. He is currently on face tent for humidification and oxygenation, but the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
3. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for complications such as ascites, jaundice, and hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and is currently at risk for bleeding due to his low platelet count.
5. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels have increased due to contrast nephropathy, and he is at risk for further kidney damage.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infectious etiology: The patient's WBC count has increased, and he is at risk for an infectious etiology.
8. Thyroid nodule: The patient has a thyroid nodule and should be closely monitored for any changes.
9. FEN: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to his hypoalbuminemia and should be closely monitored for any signs of fluid overload.

Assessment and plan:

The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening respiratory status, bleeding, or infection. The patient's lab results should be closely monitored for any changes, and the patient should be given prophylactic antibiotics for his upper GI bleed. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and he should be given oxygen therapy as needed. The patient's sodium levels should be closely monitored, and he should be given IV fluids as needed. The patient's WBC count should be closely monitored, and he should be given antibiotics if an infectious etiology is suspected. The patient's platelet count should be closely monitored, and he should be given platelet transfusions if his count is <30. The patient's thyroid nodule should be closely monitored, and he should be given thyroid medication as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - Advance diet as tolerated (sips)
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (day 1 =
   [**2-28**] for empiric 5 day course to end [**3-5**])
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent for
   humidification and oxygenation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - Start lactulose
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure and/or
   shock liver.  Monitor LFTs daily; follow-up with liver team.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count daily
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - Cont levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - Advance diet as tolerated (sips)
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (day 1 =
   [**2-28**] for empiric 5 day course to end [**3-5**])
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent for
   humidification and oxygenation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - Start lactulose
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure and/or
   shock liver.  Monitor LFTs daily; follow-up with liver team.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   81M with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices with recurrent
   variceal bleed now s/p TIPS on [**3-2**].
   # Upper GI Bleed:  Patient with BRBPR and hematemesis, EGD on [**2-18**] and
   [**2-28**] found to have grade III esophageal varices and gastric varices,
   latter of which were thought to be source of bleeding.  Since transfer
   has had intermittent maroon stools and 3 nights ago episode of BRBPR
   (150cc) with positive NGT lavage concerning for upper GI bleed. He has
   remained hemodynamically stable with slowly downtrending hematocrit.
   Discussed with liver and IR, patient is now s/p TIPS procedure.
   - Advance diet as tolerated (sips)
   - 2 large bore PIV (18), PICC
   - active type and screen, crossmatch for 4 units
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for HCT drop >5 or HCT <25
   - d/c Octreotide gtt
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue ceftriaxone for prophylaxis in setting of GI bleed (day 1 =
   [**2-28**] for empiric 5 day course to end [**3-5**])
   - continue to hold nadolol in setting of active GI bleed
   - f/u Hepatology recs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure
 patient required intubation for TIPS procedure
   and proved to be a difficult airway requiring fiberoptic intubation.
   Patient likely will be easily weaned from the vent, however, a bedside
   bronchoscopy performed on [**3-2**] revealed fresh blood and edema around
   the vocal cords likely from traumatic intubation attempts.
   - patient successfully extubated [**2107-3-3**] now on face tent for
   humidification and oxygenation
   .
   # Liver cirrhosis:  Patient without history of ascites, jaundice, or
   hepatic encephalopathy but with evidence of portal hypertension given
   gastric and esophageal varices.  Mildly impaired synthetic function
   with elevated INR and low albumin (MELD 13).  Potential etiologies
   include alcoholic, auto-immune, hemochromatosis, primary biliary
   cirrhosis, [**Last Name (un) 12611**]
s disease.  Elevated AFP could be concerning for
   malignancy although no evidence of mass on ultrasound.
   - hepatitis B/C serologies negative
   - f/u ceruloplasmin
   - Start lactulose
   - f/u liver recs
   - concerning increased AFP; consider additional imaging with CT when
   patient stable.
   - RUQ ultrasound today to assess TIPS patency
   - marked transaminitis noted [**3-3**] likely due to TIPS procedure and/or
   shock liver.  Monitor LFTs daily; follow-up with liver team.
   .
   #Shortness of breath:  Likely multifactorial.  Patient with peripheral
   edema in setting of hypoalbuminemia, bibasilar crackles, mild pulmonary
   edema on imaging consistent with volume overload.  Possible upper
   airway obstruction with questionable stridor and dysphonia following
   recent intubation, very dry mouth as NPO. Also history of COPD that
   maybe contributing to poor baseline. Anemia may also be contributing.
   No evidence of infectious process as afebrile, normal white count, no
   infiltrate on imaging.
   - continue ipratropium nebs prn
   -continue albuterol nebs prn
   -consider ENT evaluation if hoarseness persists
   - cautious use of diuretics in setting of GI bleed; re-evaluate volume
   status/oxygen requirement
   .
   #Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to 145 this AM (now 140) likely due to
   decreased access to free water in setting of NPO
   - trend sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine was 1.7 at OSH on [**2-25**] but has been trending down to
   baseline to 1.2 until contrast load [**3-2**], increased to peak of 1.6, now
   downtrending.  Urine lytes suggest intra-renal process with negative
   eosinophils.  Likely contrast nephropathy due to increased dye load in
   TIPS procedure.
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medication
   - continue IVF, monitor UOP
   - Lasix as tolerated
   - trend creatinine daily
   .
   # Increased WBC on [**3-3**] to 27 now returned to 10. ? Possible infectious
   etiology.
   - Added on diff to CBC
   - Follow-up cultures (blood, sputum, urine)
   - Monitor clinical status closely and trend WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt reportedly with h/o thrombocytopenia; 114 today
   at OSH and 150 here; now 129. Likely related to cirrhosis/splenic
   sequestration.
   - Trend platelet count daily
   - consider transfuse for <30 with active bleeding
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with cirrhosis, esophageal and gastric varices, and a recent TIPS procedure. The patient has a history of upper GI bleed, and the note indicates that the patient is at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/46 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 95% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of upper GI bleed, and the note indicates that the patient is at risk for further bleeding. The patient is receiving ceftriaxone for prophylaxis, and the note recommends continuing the medication for 5 days.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation for the TIPS procedure and has a history of COPD. The patient is currently on a face tent for humidification and oxygenation.
3. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and the note indicates that the patient's synthetic function is mildly impaired. The patient is receiving lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, likely due to decreased access to free water. The note recommends trending the patient's sodium level and adjusting treatment as necessary.
5. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, likely due to contrast nephropathy. The note recommends holding nephrotoxins, renally dosing medication, and continuing IVF.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and the note recommends trending the patient's platelet count daily and considering transfusion for <30 with active bleeding.
7. Increased WBC: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the note recommends following up with cultures (blood, sputum, urine) and monitoring the patient's clinical status closely.

The patient's medication regimen includes ceftriaxone, furosemide, pantoprazole, and levothyroxine. The patient is also receiving IVF, and the note recommends continuing IVF and repleting electrolytes as necessary.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver, who has been admitted to the ICU with a variceal bleed. He has been stable, but has been experiencing altered mental status, which is not thought to be delirium. His electrolyte and fluid disorder is being managed, and he has been started on lactulose for mild asterisks. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been experiencing mild respiratory distress. His blood cultures and urine culture are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures and urine culture are pending, and he has a history of chronic liver disease, which increases his risk of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored closely, and he has a history of COPD, which increases his risk of respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient has had a variceal bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is not thought to be delirium, and there is a risk of encephalopathy due to his liver disease.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient has a fluid disorder, and there is a risk of fluid overload, which could exacerbate his respiratory distress.
6. Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and there is a risk of kidney injury due to his liver disease and fluid disorder.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of coagulopathy due to his liver disease.

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient be closely monitored for any signs of infection, respiratory distress, bleeding, encephalopathy, fluid overload, kidney injury, or coagulopathy."
