You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 70 y.o. woman with pmh rheumatoid arthritis found to have
   bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after
   initiation of heparin gtt, transferred to ICU with anemia and
   hypotension.
   .
   ## Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus
   sheath. Possibly from worsening PE, though she has been anticoagulated,
   and echo yesterday   unlikely given Has been responsive to fluids thus
   far. [**Month (only) 8**] also be from sepsis, given acute rise in white count.  Will
   check lactate. Continue prbc's and IVF.
   - 1L bolus NS
   - pRBC if Hct drops currently stable at 25.2
   - consider rechecking lactate
   .
   ## Bilateral PEs: significant clot burden. No clear precipitant: no
   self-reported history of immobility (although her obesity would seem to
   limit her mobility), no history of malignancy, no family history of
   blood clots, no recent surgery.  Holding heparin gtt given hypotension
   and bleeding.
   - holding heparin
   - will get IVC filter to prevent further dvts while not on heparin
   - may need hypercoagulable workup as outpatient
   .
   ## Increased bladder pressure
 possibly chronicallly elevated [**3-16**]
   obesity, currently at 22, Surgeons evaluated and believe pt is at low
   risk for abdominal compartment syndrome.
   - surgery will sign off
   - will moniter bladder pressure occasionally
   ## Rectus sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after
   initiation of heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP
   is responsive to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal
   failure. Will discontinue heparin, support with blood transfusions and
   IVF.
   - continue ot moniter
   .
   ##Acute Renal Failure: Cr increase from 0.9 to 2.4, and now increase to
   3.2 in setting of hypotension and IV contrast.  FeNa 2% supporting
   etiology as contrast nephropathy vs. ATN. Currently anuric. Hematoma
   may be increasing abdominal pressure, but not causing obstruction per
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consultation..
   - consulting renal on oliguria
   - continue to moniter
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Could be infectious, vs. stress reaction from PE, acute
   hypotension.  Will pan culture, send stool for C.Diff.
   -f/u blood,urine, sputum, stool c.diff
   .
   #Tachypnea: RR 30 on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**], was 20 on floor. Possibly from
   hypotension and anemia, worsening PE, myocardial ischemia, or anxiety.
   will check cardiac enzymes. get ekg neg, CXR neg, CE neg.  On ABG pt
   has metabolic acidosis in addition to respiratory alkalosis
   - watch for resolution as primary problems improve
   .
   ## HTN: holding amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol for now given acute
   bleed
   .
   ## RA: Humira and MTX held since last admission, per rheum,
   Nocontraindication to restarting these meds with PEs. However, with
   acute bleed, will hold off on restarting until stabilized.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

A 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. She was started on heparin, but developed bleeding and was transferred to the ICU. She received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was given 1 liter of normal saline (NS) for hypotension. Her vital signs are stable, but her respiratory rate is increasing. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is taking medications for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus sheath, worsening pulmonary embolism, or sepsis. Continuous monitoring and treatment with PRBCs and IV fluids are necessary.
2. Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has a significant clot burden, and it is unclear what triggered the pulmonary embolism. Holding heparin and considering an IVC filter to prevent further deep vein thromboses (DVTs) are necessary.
3. Rectus Sheath Hematoma: The patient's rectus sheath hematoma is not responding to PRBC infusions, and her blood pressure is responsive to fluids. Discontinuing heparin and supporting with blood transfusions and IV fluids are necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.9 to 3.2, and she is anuric. Consulting a nephrologist and continuing to monitor her renal function are necessary.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be due to infection, stress reaction from pulmonary embolism, or acute hypotension. Pan-culture, stool for C. diff, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures are necessary.
6. Tachypnea: The patient's tachypnea could be due to hypotension, anemia, worsening pulmonary embolism, myocardial ischemia, or anxiety. Monitoring her respiratory status and treating underlying conditions are necessary.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with a statin, but her recent bleeding may require temporary discontinuation of this medication.
8. Rheumatoid Arthritis: The patient's rheumatoid arthritis is being managed with Humira and methotrexate, but these medications may need to be restarted once she is stabilized.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may require treatment with IV fluids and electrolyte repletion.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. Her bleeding rectus sheath hematoma and bilateral pulmonary emboli require immediate attention. Her acute renal failure and leukocytosis also need to be addressed. Her hyperlipidemia and rheumatoid arthritis require ongoing management. A multidisciplinary approach involving intensivists, nephrologists, and rheumatologists is necessary to ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y.o. woman with pmh rheumatoid arthritis found to have bilateral
   pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after initiation
   of heparin gtt, transferred to ICU with anemia and hypotension.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 bilateral significant clot burden.
   No clear precipitant: no self-reported history of immobility (although
   her obesity would seem to limit her mobility), no history of
   malignancy, no family history of blood clots, no recent surgery.
   Holding heparin gtt given hypotension and bleeding.
   - holding heparin
   - s/p IVC filter placement
   - may need hypercoagulable workup as outpatient
   - will need to restart anticoagulation eventually to prevent IVC filter
   clot.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING) Rectus
   sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after initiation of
   heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP is responsive
   to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal failure. S
   - Continue to support with blood transfusions and IVF.
   - anticoagulation stopped
   ## Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus
   sheath vs sepsis vs worsening PE (echo without elevated PASP).
   - 1L bolus NS
   - pRBC if Hct dropping
   - consider rechecking lactate
   - f/u pancultures, cdiff
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr increase from 0.9
   to 2.4, and now increase to 3.2 in setting of hypotension and IV
   contrast.  FeNa 2% supporting etiology as contrast nephropathy vs. ATN.
   Currently anuric. Hematoma may be increasing abdominal pressure, but
   not causing obstruction per [**Doctor First Name 91**] consultation..
   - consulting renal on oliguria
   - continue to moniter
   - Increased bladder pressure
 possibly chronicallly elevated [**3-16**]
   obesity, currently at 22, Surgeons evaluated and believe pt is at low
   risk for abdominal compartment syndrome. -> recheck
 TACHYPNEA - RR 30 on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**], was 20 on floor. Possibly
   from hypotension and anemia, worsening PE, myocardial ischemia, or
   anxiety. will check cardiac enzymes. get ekg neg, CXR neg, CE neg.  On
   ABG pt has metabolic acidosis in addition to respiratory alkalosis
   - watch for resolution as primary problems improve
   #Leukocytosis: Improved from 25 to 14 without treatment. Likely stress
   reaction from PE. Ruling out infectious sources
   -f/u blood,urine, sputum, stool c.diff
   ## HTN: holding amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol for now given acute
   bleed
   ## RA: Humira and MTX held since last admission, per rheum,
   Nocontraindication to restarting these meds with PEs. However, with
   acute bleed, will hold off on restarting until stabilized.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. The patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis may be indicative of pneumonia, which could be a complication of the pulmonary embolism or a secondary infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which could be caused by a secondary infection or the rectus sheath hematoma.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's increased creatinine levels and anuria may indicate acute kidney injury, which could be caused by the rectus sheath hematoma, contrast nephropathy, or acute tubular necrosis.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's increased bladder pressure and anuria may indicate abdominal compartment syndrome, which could be caused by the rectus sheath hematoma and potentially life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's rectus sheath hematoma and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Hypercoagulable state: The patient's pulmonary embolism and rectus sheath hematoma may indicate a hypercoagulable state, which could increase the risk of future thrombotic events.

The patient's laboratory results indicate that she has acute anemia, acute kidney injury, and hypercoagulability. Her imaging studies show bilateral pulmonary emboli and a rectus sheath hematoma. The patient's clinical course is complicated by her hypotension, tachypnea, and anuria.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address the patient's acute kidney injury, anemia, and hypercoagulable state."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y.o. woman with pmh rheumatoid arthritis found to have bilateral
   pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma after initiation
   of heparin gtt, transferred to ICU with anemia and hypotension.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 bilateral significant clot burden.
   No clear precipitant: no self-reported history of immobility (although
   her obesity would seem to limit her mobility), no history of
   malignancy, no family history of blood clots, no recent surgery.
   Holding heparin gtt given hypotension and bleeding.
   - holding heparin
   - s/p IVC filter placement
   - may need hypercoagulable workup as outpatient
   - will need to restart anticoagulation eventually to prevent IVC filter
   clot.
 TACHYPNEA - RR 30 on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**], was 20 on floor. Possibly
   from hypotension and anemia, peripheral PEs.  Cardiac ischemia ruled
   out with neg Ces, unchanged EKG.  On ABG pt has metabolic acidosis in
   addition to respiratory alkalosis
   - watch for resolution as primary problems improve
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING) Rectus
   sheath hematoma: Appears to be spontaneous bleed after initiation of
   heparin. Currently not responding to prbc infusions.  BP is responsive
   to fluids. IR will not take for study given acute renal failure.
   - Continue to support with blood transfusions and IVF.
   - anticoagulation stopped
   ## Hypotension: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from bleeding rectus
   sheath vs sepsis (unlikely as improving without antibiotics) vs
   worsening PE (echo without elevated PASP). Responded well to IVF.
   - IVF prn
   - consider rechecking lactate
   - f/u pancultures, cdiff
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF) Cr increase from 0.9
   to 3.2 in setting of hypotension and IV contrast, now 1.5.  FeNa 2%
   supporting etiology as contrast nephropathy and ATN ruled out with no
   muddy brown casts on sediment. Starting to make urine. Hematoma and
   obesity likely increasing abdominal pressure, but not causing
   compartment syndrome clinically.
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to moniter
   - no need to recheck bladder pressure
   #Leukocytosis: Improved from 25 to 14 without treatment. Likely stress
   reaction from PE. Ruling out infectious sources
   -f/u blood,urine, sputum, stool c.diff
   ## HTN: holding amlodipine, lisinopril, metoprolol for now given acute
   bleed
   ## RA: Humira and MTX held since last admission, per rheum,  No
   contraindication to restarting these meds with PEs. However, will first
   tbw with rheumatologist re: their plan.
   ## hyperlipidemia: continue statin

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. She was started on heparin, but it was held due to hypotension and bleeding. An IVC filter was placed, and she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) with a subsequent increase in her hemoglobin level from 22.2 to 24.4. She has acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, and her cardiac enzymes are normal. She has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a stress reaction from the pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an IVC filter in place, which reduces the risk of DVT. However, she still needs to be monitored for DVT, especially with the presence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Recurrence: The patient has bilateral significant clot burden, and there is a risk of PE recurrence if anticoagulation is not restarted.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function if her blood pressure is not controlled and she continues to receive nephrotoxic medications.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, and there is a risk of further bleeding if her coagulation status is not carefully monitored.
5. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be a sign of infection. She needs to be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count.
6. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, but there is a risk of cardiac ischemia due to her pulmonary embolism and hypotension.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory alkalosis, which could worsen if her pulmonary embolism is not treated promptly.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and her lipid levels need to be monitored to prevent further complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary problems are bilateral pulmonary embolism, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. She needs to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, infection, and cardiac ischemia. She should be restarted on anticoagulation once her bleeding has resolved, and her renal function is stable. Her electrolytes, cardiac enzymes, and renal function need to be closely monitored. She should be continued on stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. She was initially treated with heparin, but it was held due to hypotension and bleeding. An IVC filter was placed, and she is being monitored for hypercoagulable workup as an outpatient. She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which has since resolved, and is being monitored for any signs of compartment syndrome. Her blood pressure has improved with IV fluids, and she is being supported with blood transfusions and IV fluids. She has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a stress reaction from the PE, and is being monitored for any signs of infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - The patient has already been diagnosed with bilateral PE, which is a life-threatening condition. If not properly treated, it can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or even death.
2. Spontaneous Rectus Sheath Hematoma - The patient has already experienced a spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, which can lead to further bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and even death if not properly treated.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) - The patient has already experienced ARF, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and even death if not properly treated.
4. Hypercoagulable State - The patient's hypercoagulable state can lead to further clotting complications, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Infection - The patient's leukocytosis and history of spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma make her susceptible to infection, particularly in the abdominal and pelvic regions.
6. Cardiovascular Complications - The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and recent bleeding can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest and stroke.
7. Respiratory Complications - The patient's bilateral PE can lead to respiratory failure, and her history of rheumatoid arthritis can increase her risk of respiratory complications, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and ensure her safety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. She was initially treated with heparin, but it was held due to bleeding and hypotension. An IVC filter was placed, and anticoagulation was stopped. The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and her hypotension has resolved with IV fluids. She has acute renal failure, which was initially attributed to hypovolemia and IV contrast, but is now suspected to be due to contrast nephropathy. The patient's leukocytosis has improved without treatment, and she is being monitored for infectious sources. Her medications, including her rheumatoid arthritis medications, have been held or adjusted due to her acute condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has already developed bilateral pulmonary emboli, and there is a risk of DVT given her immobility and history of rheumatoid arthritis.
2. Pulmonary Embolism Recurrence: The patient's pulmonary emboli have not fully resolved, and there is a risk of recurrence if anticoagulation is not restarted.
3. Bleeding Complications: The patient's rectus sheath hematoma is not fully resolved, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications if anticoagulation is restarted.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure is still present, and there is a risk of AKI worsening if not monitored and managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, and she should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased white blood cell count.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be signs of underlying cardiovascular disease, and she should be monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia or other cardiovascular complications.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachypnea may be a sign of underlying respiratory disease, and she should be monitored for signs of respiratory failure or other respiratory complications.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary emboli, spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma, anemia, and hypotension. She was initially treated with heparin, but it was held due to hypotension and bleeding. An IVC filter was placed, and anticoagulation was stopped. The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and she is being supported with blood transfusions and IV fluids. Her hypotension has resolved, and she is being monitored for renal failure, which has resolved. The patient's leukocytosis has improved, and she is being monitored for infectious sources. She is being restarted on her home medications, including lisinopril, metoprolol, and amlodipine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has bilateral significant clot burden, and there is a risk of further clotting. She may need to be restarted on anticoagulation eventually to prevent IVC filter clot.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and she may require further blood transfusions.
3. Renal Failure: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, she may be at risk of developing acute kidney injury again, especially if she has further episodes of hypotension or bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis has improved, but she is still at risk of developing an infection, especially with her compromised immune system.
5. Bleeding: The patient's spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma is a risk factor for further bleeding, especially if she is restarted on anticoagulation.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but she may be at risk of developing hypotension again if she has further episodes of bleeding or blood loss.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and pulmonary emboli may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent further complications."
