   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decombensated heart failure and
   possible ACS vs. PE.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  EKG concerning for a STEMI with RCA lesion while on
   dobutamine last night.  CKs are flat and pt is unable to lay flat,
   requiring significant oxygen.  Now off Dobutamine and ECG changes
   resolved.
   -- will defer cath given difficulty laying flat and no acute infarct
   pattern currently.  Will continue to monitor ECGs and enzymes.  Will
   continue diuresis to optimize respiratory status prior to cath.
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin (concern for PE)
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- d/c integrillin as no immediate plan to go to cath
   -- hold metoprolol in the setting of decompensated heart failure
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of IMI
   .
   # PUMP:  Precipitous events of decompensated HF not particularly
   clear.  Recent chest pain, new TTE findings, and q-waves on EKG
   concerning for recent MI with worsening heart failure.  Cannot rule out
   possiblity of PE with exudate effusion.  Patient with elevated JVP,
   marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.  Unclear if there is an
   acute event that has worsened dyspnea, heart failure.   Pt responding
   to Lasix gtt with 450 out since midnight.
   - IV lasix gtt for diuresis
   - hold beta-blocker in the setting of decompensated HF
   - hold Lisinopril due to hypotension
   - f/u TTE today
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.  Will continue to
   treat these potential underlying causes.
   .

   which is less likely given exudative effusion.  PE possible cause,
   which would unify right axis shift, hypoxia, and ST in this obese
   patient.
   - f/u lab studies from OSH with concerns for PNA
   - cont heparin gtt for possible PE
   - LENIs today, consider CTA to r/o PE
   - diureisis as described above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease, presenting with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient has been treated with various medications, including diuretics, anticoagulants, and beta-blockers. He has also undergone cardiac catheterization and has been diagnosed with a STEMI with RCA lesion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and his lung sounds are decreased on the left side.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side, rales on the right side, and marked stasis dermatitis on both lower extremities. His abdomen is obese with pronounced panus, and his extremities are warm and dry.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction. His creatinine level is elevated at 1.3 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL.

The patient's diagnosis is decompensated heart failure with possible ACS or PE. He is being treated with diuretics, anticoagulants, and beta-blockers, and is being monitored for further complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is increased, and his lung sounds are decreased on the left side, indicating possible respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and he has a history of cardiac disease, making him susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest possible sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN level suggest possible renal failure.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest possible pulmonary embolism, which can be a life-threatening complication.
6. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest possible cardiac tamponade, which can be a life-threatening complication.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He is currently in the ICU with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
* Heart rate: 89 bpm (normal range: 88-118 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/51 mmHg (normal range: 79-100/39-54 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (normal range: 21-31 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 97% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Morbid obesity
* Tachypnea and diaphoresis
* Muffled heart sounds
* Decreased breath sounds on the left side, with rales up to the apex
* Obese abdomen with pronounced panus
* Marked stasis dermatitis on both extremities

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Hematocrit: 31.1% (normal range: 41-53%)
* White blood cell count: 10.4 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 305 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.10 ng/mL (normal range: <0.10 ng/mL)
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 224 IU/L (normal range: 140-280 IU/L)

The patient's EKG shows ST elevations in lead III, which may indicate a STEMI. However, the patient has no current complaints of chest pain, and cardiac catheterization has been deferred.

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning off dobutamine and repeating EKG
* Cyclic enzymes
* Continuing ASA, Plavix, and heparin
* Starting integrillin
* Holding metoprolol due to decompensated heart failure
* Avoiding nitrates due to possible IMI
* Continuing high-dose statin
* Considering cardiac catheterization based on serial EKGs and cardiac markers

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Heart failure exacerbation
* Respiratory failure
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hypothyroidism
* Hypoglycemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Anemia
* Renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalance

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has significant heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%, indicating severe left ventricular dysfunction. There is also evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, and the patient is at high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE).
* Respiratory: The patient has severe pulmonary edema and effusions, with decreased breath sounds on the left side and crackles on the left side.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 99/37 mmHg, with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute. The patient's cardiac output is decreased, and the patient is in sinus tachycardia.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, indicating mild renal impairment.
* Laboratory: The patient's white blood cell count is 11.9 x 10^9/L, with a hematocrit of 31.5%. The patient's platelet count is 337 x 10^9/L. The patient's troponin level is 0.15 ng/mL, which is decreased from previous levels.
* Imaging: The patient's chest X-ray shows heart failure with a left pleural effusion. The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows global left ventricular hypokinesis with near-akinesis of the inferior wall, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at high risk for PE due to their morbid obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and relative immobility.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's severe pulmonary edema and effusions can lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's severe left ventricular dysfunction and multivessel coronary artery disease increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's mild renal impairment and decreased cardiac output increase the risk of renal failure.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of a pleural effusion increase the risk of infection.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan of care should include:

* Continued treatment for heart failure, including diuresis and vasodilators.
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent pulmonary embolism.
* Monitoring for respiratory failure and providing oxygen therapy as needed.
* Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and providing prompt treatment for any signs of cardiac instability.
* Monitoring for renal failure and providing dialysis as needed.
* Preventing infection by maintaining proper wound care and administering antibiotics as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with decompensated heart failure and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus pulmonary embolism (PE). He has a significant amount of fluid in his lungs and a large effusion on the left side. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows concern for a STEMI with a lesion in the right coronary artery, but subsequent CKs are flat, and the patient is unable to lay flat due to respiratory distress.

The patient is currently on heparin, lasix, and metoprolol, but the metoprolol is being held due to decompensated heart failure. The patient is also on a cardiac diet and has a central venous catheter (CVC) in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's exudative effusion and hypoxia raise concern for PE, which could be a life-threatening complication.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's EKG shows concern for a STEMI, and the patient's symptoms are consistent with ACS.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's decompensated heart failure is a significant concern, and the patient's fluid status is being closely monitored.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia raise concern for respiratory failure, which could be a life-threatening complication.
5. Infection: The patient's exudative effusion raises concern for infection, which could be a complication of PE or a secondary infection.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count raises concern for thrombocytopenia, which could be a complication of PE or ACS.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is a potential underlying condition that could be exacerbating his symptoms.
8. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes and fluid status raise concern for diabetic ketoacidosis, which could be a life-threatening complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and respiratory status closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's possible PE with heparin and consider a CTA to rule out PE.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and EKGs to rule out ACS.
4. Continue to manage the patient's diabetes and hypothyroidism.
5. Consider antibiotics if the patient's exudative effusion is suspected to be infected.
6. Consider transfusing platelets if the patient's thrombocytopenia worsens.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider invasive cardiac monitoring if necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or intensivist to further manage the patient's condition."

   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.

   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin and will transition to warfarin given
   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI
   -- change aspirin to 81mg due to anticoagulation and high bleeding risk
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx
   consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive
   value.   PE remains on differential.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint: 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decombensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   PPD placed yesterday.  BCx, UCx, and UA were sent given low grade
   fever.  Levofloxacin 750 mg x5 days was started for PNA yesterday.  His
   lantus was increased to 14 units for better blood sugar control.  The
   lasix gtt was continued for diuresis and metolazone 5 mg daily was
   added.  Blood cultures came back positive for GPRs (originally reported
   as GPCs).  Since this is likely a contaminate, antibiotics were not
   started.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   The patient was started continued on a heparin gtt and started on
   coumadin given his high risk for PE (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**].  The pleural
   effusion is thought to be peri-pneumonic, however a PPD was placed as
   TB is a possibility.  BCx, UCx, and UA were sent given low grade
   fever.  Levofloxacin 750 mg x5 days was started for PNA.  His lantus
   was increased to 14 units for better blood sugar control.  The lasix
   gtt was continued for diuresis and metolazone 5 mg daily was added.

   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.  Pt. w/ nonproductive cough
   o/n.  Denies CP, SOB at rest, DOE w/ transfers from bed to chair has

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- Continue ASA 81
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion.  Multiloculated, consistent w/ peri-pneumonic
   effusion.  CT consistent w/ multifocal opacities, but source is still
   unclear as no aspiration, possibly atypical infection, being covered w/
   Levofloxacin.  Mediastinal [**Doctor First Name **] reactive vs. malignant.   Differential
   includes PNA as most likely or malignancy, vs PE/heart failure which
   are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx consistent w/ PNA.
   LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive value.   PE remains on
   differential.  PPD negative at 48hrs.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH daily
   - follow-up PPD @ 72hrs for ?TB
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 3 of

   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   - pt may require bronch once HF improves and Tx of PNA complete.
   - F/U Cx data
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary effusions.  Urine output improved
   on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia continues to improve.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -1 to 2
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.
 Metoprolol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD
   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.  Pt. w/ nonproductive cough
   o/n.  Denies CP, SOB at rest, DOE w/ transfers from bed to chair has
   improved.
   Allergies:
   Last dose of Antibiotics:
   Levofloxacin - [**2164-11-25**] 08:00 AM

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease, presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia.

The patient has been treated with diuresis using Lasix and Metolazone, and his urine output has improved. He has also been started on heparin and Coumadin for treatment of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and his ECGs are consistent with demand ischemia. Catheterization has been deferred at this time.

The patient has a multiloculated pleural effusion, which is consistent with a peri-pneumonic effusion. The source of the effusion is unclear, and the patient is being treated with Levofloxacin for possible atypical infection.

The patient's anemia is normocytic, and his TSH is within normal limits. His hemoglobin level is 10.0 g/dL, and his hematocrit is 31.5%.

The patient has been prescribed medications for his conditions, including:

* Aspirin 81 mg daily
* Heparin 2,400 units/hour
* Coumadin for treatment of pulmonary embolism
* Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID for treatment of tachycardia and suspected demand
* Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis
* Levofloxacin for treatment of possible atypical infection
* Insulin sliding scale for treatment of diabetes
* Lantus 14 units qday for treatment of diabetes
* Synthroid for treatment of hypothyroidism

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 95/62 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for marked stasis dermatitis and lymphedema of both legs, as well as a large bowel movement. He has a nonproductive cough and is oriented to person, place, and time.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 31.5%
* White blood cell count: 10.4
* Platelet count: 352 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, chloride 28 mg/dL
* Trop T: 0.10
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL

The patient's chest CT scan shows a loculated left pleural effusion with three components, as well as scattered patchy airspace opacities bilaterally, which may be infectious or inflammatory in nature. The patient's cardiac CT scan shows cardiomegaly with atherosclerosis involving the coronary arteries.

The patient's diagnosis is decompensated heart failure, likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear precipitating factors. He also has a multiloculated pleural effusion, which is consistent with a peri-pneumonic effusion.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia
* Pulmonary embolism
* Atypical infection
* Malignancy
* Heart failure
* Ischemic cardiomyopathy
* Hypothyroidism
* Diabetes
* Anemia
* Normocytic anemia
* Chronic venous stasis and lymphedema

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Diuresis using Lasix and Metolazone
* Treatment of pulmonary embolism with heparin and Coumadin
* Antibiotics for possible atypical infection
* Insulin sliding scale for treatment of diabetes
* Lantus for treatment of diabetes
* Synthroid for treatment of hypothyroidism
* Wound care for chronic venous stasis and lymphedema
* Vascular consult for possible treatment of chronic venous stasis and lymphedema."

   presenting with decombensated heart failure and likely demand
   ischemia.
   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.  Pt. w/ nonproductive cough

   pleural effusion.
   2. Scattered patchy airspace opacities bilaterally, which may be
   infectious or inflammatory in nature, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
   recommend follow-up CT after treatment and resolution of acute
   symptomatology to establish improvement or resolution.
   3. Cardiomegaly with atherosclerosis involving the coronary arteries.
   4. Cholelithiasis
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- Continue ASA 81
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion.  Multiloculated, consistent w/ peri-pneumonic
   effusion.  CT consistent w/ multifocal opacities, but source is still
   unclear as no aspiration, possibly atypical infection, being covered w/
   Levofloxacin.  Mediastinal [**Doctor First Name **] reactive vs. malignant.   Differential
   includes PNA as most likely or malignancy, vs PE/heart failure which
   are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx consistent w/ PNA.
   LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive value.   PE remains on
   differential.  PPD negative at 48hrs.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH daily
   - follow-up PPD @ 72hrs for ?TB
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 3 of
   5.
   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   - pt may require bronch once HF improves and Tx of PNA complete.
   - F/U Cx data
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary effusions.  Urine output improved
   on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia continues to improve.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -1 to 2
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.
 Metoprolol
   12.5 [**Hospital1 **], continue to tx as above w/ heparin/coumadin
   .
   # GPRs in blood: from peripheral IV; likely contaminate
   - will hold off on antibiotics until further speciation; surveillance
   cultures drawn today
   - f/u blood culture speciation
   # Anemia.  Normocytic.  TSH wnl.  HCT not improving w/ diuresis.
   Baseline unknown.  Will complete w/up.
   -          Fe studies,
   -          Guiac all stools
   -          B12, Folate.
   -          Will consider SPEP/UPEP if above not revealing give RF, but
   low suspicion for MM.
   # Diabetes:  On Lantus 14 units qday and insulin sliding scale, holding
   glyburide, Goal BG < 150, FS < 140 mostly, but increased at AM.
   - f/u blood sugars today and will increase Lantus
   # Hypothyroidism:  cont home synthroid.
   .
   FEN:  cardiac diet since no cath this morning
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with systemic heparin
   -Pain managment with tylenol
   -Bowel regimen with colace; will give Senna and Bisacodyl (last BM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who is presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia.

The patient's condition has been managed with diuresis using Lasix and Metolazone, and he has been treated with antibiotics for a suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the blood culture results showed growth of Bacillus species, which is likely a contaminant.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are flat, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) shows signs of demand ischemia. He has been started on aspirin, heparin, and Coumadin for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy.

The patient's pulmonary effusion is multifocal and exudative, and the source is still unclear. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, malignancy, and PE, but the patient's history is not consistent with pneumonia. The patient's PPD test is negative, but this has poor predictive value.

The patient's anemia is normocytic, and his TSH is within normal limits. His hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, and his hematocrit is 31.5%. His platelet count is 352 K/uL.

The patient's glucose level is 227 mg/dL, and he is being treated with Lantus and insulin sliding scale. His blood pressure is 95/62 mmHg, and his heart rate is 74 beats per minute.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his SpO2 is 99%. His ABG shows a pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and pO2 of 94 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is significant for tachypnea and diaphoresis. His chest is clear to auscultation, and his lung fields are clear. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. His extremities show marked stasis dermatitis and lymphedema.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rate is 74 beats per minute, and his ECG shows signs of demand ischemia. He may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary effusion is multifocal and exudative, and the source is still unclear. He may be at risk for pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is normocytic, and his TSH is within normal limits. He may be at risk for further anemia, which could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Infection: The patient's blood culture results showed growth of Bacillus species, which is likely a contaminant. He may be at risk for infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, which could lead to respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 352 K/uL, which is low. He may be at risk for thrombocytopenia, which could lead to bleeding and increased risk of infection.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy, but his TSH is within normal limits. He may be at risk for hypothyroidism, which could lead to fatigue, cold intolerance, and decreased cardiac output.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   Continued diuresis with Lasix gtt and Metolazone.  Got Chest CT
   (with mucomyst) to assess for malignancy and further characterize
   parapneumonic effusion.  CT showed 3 loculated effusions in left lobe.
   Aspirin changed to 81mg.  Pt had blood culture from [**11-24**] PIV which
   grew Bacillus species, not anthrax.  This was originally mis-reported
   as GPC in chains and pt was started on Vanco, then stopped after
   results changed to GPRs.  ID curbside --> likely contaminate.  No abxs
   started.  Per PICC line team, will not place bedside PICC.  Pt is NPO
   for possible IR PICC placement.  Lasix gtt increased from 2 to 5 for
   diuresis.  Pt had large bowel movement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 69 year old morbidly obese male with a hx of DM, HTN,
   dyslipidemia, CAD presenting with decompensated heart failure and
   likely demand ischemia.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  ECGs consistent with demand ischemia and enzymes flat.
   Cath deferred at this time.  Patient has been chest pain free.
   -- will defer cath given flat enzymes.
   -- d/c Plavix as not currently ACS
   -- continue heparin and transition to Coumadin given high risk for PE;
   will likely need life-long coumadin due to body habitus
   -- cont ASA, plavix, and heparin and will transition to warfarin given
   high risk for PE (per discussion w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2830**]
   -- cont high dose statin
   -- continue metoprolol given tachycardia and suspected demand;
   currently tolerating 12.5mg PO BID
   -- avoid nitrates with concern of past IMI
   -- change aspirin to 81mg due to anticoagulation and high bleeding risk
   .
   # Pulmonary Effusion: Consistent w/ peri-pneumonic effusion.
   Differential includes PNA as most likely, malignancy or PE/heart
   failure which are less likely given exudative effusion.  No hx
   consistent w/ PNA.  LENIs negative, but this has poor predictive
   value.   PE remains on differential.
   - f/u updated lab studies from OSH today
   - follow-up PPD for ?TB
   - obtain Chest CT today to evaluate effusion further and potential for
   malignancy
   - Levofloxacin for 5 day course (day #1 = [**2164-11-24**]); today is day 2 of
   5.
   - diureisis as below
   - treat for PE with heparin and Coumadin
   # PUMP:  HF likely related to ischemic cardiomyopathy of unclear
   precipitating factors.  Possibly he had recent ischemic event.  Patient
   with elevated JVP, marked pulmonary edema/effusions, elevated BNP.
   Urine output improved on Lasix gtt and Metolazone.   Hypoxia is
   improving.
   - continue Lasix gtt and Metolazone for diuresis with goal -2 to 3
   liters today
   - f/u PM lytes
   - continue w/ beta-blocker to improve filling
   - holding Lisinopril due to hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to decompensated heart
   failure, hypoxia.  Cannot rule out pulmonary embolis.
 Metoprolol
   12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # GPRs in blood: from peripheral IV; likely contaminate
   - will hold off on antibiotics until further speciation; surveillance
   cultures drawn today
   - f/u blood culture speciation
   # Diabetes:  On Lantus 14 units qday and insulin sliding scale, holding
   glyburide, Goal BG < 150.
   - f/u blood sugars today and adjust Lantus as needed
   # Hypothyroidism:  cont home synthroid.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old morbidly obese male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease, presenting with decompensated heart failure and likely demand ischemia. He has been treated with diuresis, antibiotics, and heparin, and is currently being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure and demand ischemia put him at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary edema and effusions increase his risk of respiratory failure, pneumonia, and respiratory arrest.
3. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of a central line increase his risk of infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections.
4. Thrombotic complications: The patient's use of heparin and Coumadin increases his risk of bleeding, but also puts him at risk for thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes and hypothyroidism require careful management to prevent metabolic complications, including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and thyroid storm.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's morbid obesity and cardiac condition increase his risk of malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate his underlying conditions.
7. Psychological complications: The patient's critical illness and hospitalization can lead to psychological complications, including anxiety, depression, and delirium.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix and Metolazone to manage the patient's heart failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy to treat the patient's suspected pneumonia and pleural effusion.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, including his oxygen saturation and respiratory rate.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status closely, including his caloric intake and electrolyte levels.
6. Consider early mobilization and physical therapy to prevent complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pressure ulcers.
7. Provide psychological support and counseling to the patient and his family to help manage the patient's anxiety and depression."
