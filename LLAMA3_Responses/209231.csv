   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had abdominal pain on exam got plain film: nonobstructive bowel gas
   pattern. No evidence of free air. Scoliosis. Large
   hiatal hernia.
   - R shoulder/arm pain --> plain film: diffuse osteopenia. No definite
   fracture seen. Subtle fracture might be missed, get CT if further
   concern.
   - C spine flexion/extension plain films WET read: suboptimal for
   evaluation due to multilevel severe DJD. If continuos concern MRI can
   be done to r/o ligamentous injury.
   - 5pm Hct 26.4 --> 1130pm Hct 25.5, and CE's trended down
   - Trauma: attempt to clear c-collar clinically, serial abdominal exams.
   - Ortho: merits ORIF but is DNR/DNR, cognitively impaired presently.
   Will discuss with family before proceeding.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Need to get consent for blood products as we currently have no ICU
   consent
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than [**Last Name (LF) 11653**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   this isn
t an active issue but important to keep in mind.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR
   Prophylaxis: lovenox.
   Access: peripherals, 18g in L hand
   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 2057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11638**] in WA [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11639**]. SW

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the ICU with multiple injuries, including a new hip fracture, abdominal pain, and R arm/shoulder pain. She has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, and her troponin levels have trended downward. She has also been diagnosed with anemia, leukocytosis, and UTI.

Potential medical complications:

1. Abdominal process: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may be indicative of an underlying abdominal process, such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or diverticulitis. The worsening WBC count and lipase levels suggest an inflammatory response, which may require further evaluation and management.
2. Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels and worsening anemia suggest possible ischemia, which may be related to her cardiac condition, new fracture, or other underlying conditions.
3. Infection: The patient's UTI and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory alkalosis and hyperventilation may be indicative of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may be related to her medical condition, medications, or other factors, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's history of hypotension and hypertension may indicate hemodynamic instability, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may be indicative of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, which may require further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pain and tenderness, and consider further evaluation and management if necessary.
2. Continue to trend the patient's troponin levels and consider further evaluation and management if necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's UTI and monitor her WBC count and other laboratory results.
4. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's respiratory alkalosis and hyperventilation.
5. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's delirium and altered mental status.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and consider further evaluation and management if necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

Summary:

The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She was admitted with a new hip fracture, UTI, and elevated troponin levels. She has also reported abdominal pain, right arm and shoulder pain, and a fall from a commode. Imaging studies have shown a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, severe degenerative changes in the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine, and a small focus of air within the bladder.

The patient has been treated with antibiotics for the UTI, and her troponin levels have trended downward. She has also been started on pain medication and has been placed on telemetry to monitor for dysrhythmia.

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications that could arise. These include:

1. Abdominal process: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness, combined with the rising WBC count and worsening abdominal exam, suggest the possibility of an abdominal process, such as pancreatitis or bowel obstruction.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated troponin levels and WBC count suggest the possibility of an infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of CAD make it possible that she has had a myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of CVA make it possible that she has developed respiratory failure.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and confusion suggest the possibility of neurological deterioration, such as a stroke or seizure.

Given the patient's complex condition and potential for medical complications, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the hospital with a new hip fracture, UTI, and elevated troponin levels. She has undergone a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which revealed a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, extending to the distal portion of the femoral prosthetic stem, with anterior displacement of the distal fragment.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hip fracture: The patient has a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, which requires operative repair.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely due to demand ischemia caused by the stress of the fracture, rather than a new thrombotic event.
3. UTI: The patient has a history of chronic urinary frequency and is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to stress, UTI, or other infection.
5. Hypotensive episode: The patient experienced a transient episode of hypotension, which is unclear in its etiology.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to delirium caused by the fall, fracture, infection, and medications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, likely due to stress, UTI, or other medical complications.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine.
9. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with bupropion.
10. Glaucoma: The patient has a history of glaucoma and is being treated with home medications.

The patient's medical team is considering various treatments and interventions, including:

1. Operative repair of the hip fracture.
2. Cardiac ischemia evaluation and treatment.
3. UTI treatment and monitoring.
4. Leukocytosis monitoring and treatment.
5. Hypotensive episode evaluation and treatment.
6. Altered mental status evaluation and treatment.
7. Hypertension management.
8. Hypothyroidism management.
9. Depression management.
10. Glaucoma management.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement."

 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis.  History of chronic urinary frequency at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on
   methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Send blood cultures if spikes.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented and described as ""cranky"".  Here
   patient is somewhat lethargic with speech that seems sometimes confused
   and at other times is difficult to understand.  Likely delerium in
   setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue home meds with holding parameters.
   - Give IV metoprolol if not taking PO meds.
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had abdominal pain on exam got plain film: nonobstructive bowel gas
   pattern. No evidence of free air. Scoliosis. Large
   hiatal hernia.
   - R shoulder/arm pain --> plain film: diffuse osteopenia. No definite
   fracture seen. Subtle fracture might be missed, get CT if further
   concern.
   - C spine flexion/extension plain films WET read: suboptimal for
   evaluation due to multilevel severe DJD. If continuos concern MRI can
   be done to r/o ligamentous injury.
   - 5pm Hct 26.4 --> 1130pm Hct 25.5, and CE's trended down
   - Trauma: attempt to clear c-collar clinically (?), serial abdominal
   exams.
   - Ortho: merits ORIF but is DNR/DNR, cognitively impaired presently.

Summary:

The patient is a 94-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a history of fall from a commode, new hip fracture, and abdominal pain. She has a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She was found to have a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, extending to the distal portion of the femoral prosthetic stem, with anterior displacement of the distal fragment. She also has severe degenerative changes throughout the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine, with significant spinal canal stenosis.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including:

1. NSTEMI: Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute fracture, not an ACS event.
2. UTI: >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with leukocytosis. History of chronic urinary frequency.
3. Leukocytosis: Neutrophil predominance without bands. [**Month (only) 51**] in part be related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection or MI related.
4. Hypotensive episode: Per report at OSH. Further details and etiology unclear. Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
5. Altered mental status: Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at baseline, alert and mostly oriented and described as ""cranky"". Here patient is somewhat lethargic with speech that seems sometimes confused and at other times is difficult to understand. Likely delirium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.
6. Hypertension: Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
7. Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
8. Depression: Continue bupropion.
9. Glaucoma: Continue home meds.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: Given the patient's history of UTI and leukocytosis, there is a high risk of developing a secondary infection.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, NSTEMI, and hypertension increases her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, or heart failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD and respiratory failure increases her risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and altered mental status increases her risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or neurological deterioration.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain, UTI, and leukocytosis increases her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
6. Skeletal complications: The patient's history of hip fracture, osteoporosis, and degenerative changes throughout the spine increases her risk of developing skeletal complications, such as further fractures, osteoporosis, or spinal cord compression.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for any signs of deterioration and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.  Continue digoxin.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - ASA, high dose statin.  Switch back to beta-blocker from diltiazem
   gtt.
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.  ? diffuse pain.
   - C spine cleared by trauma team.
   - Further work-up of fall will be held pending clarification of goals
   of care.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Continue to rise, predominantly PMN
s without bands.
   Likely stress response and UTI.  Need C.diff though patient not
   stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.  Limiting fentanyl as possible.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine IV for now..
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the ICU with atrial fibrillation, new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin, and abdominal pain. She is cachectic, with poor coloring, and has a regular rhythm. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 131 bpm, and blood pressure of 77/52 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 99%. Her physical examination reveals clear lungs, soft abdomen, and no signs of tenderness.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin, CK, and CKMB, indicating myocardial infarction. Her WBC count is 33.9 K/uL, and her Hct is 26.4%. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level. Her imaging studies show a hip fracture, and her microbiology results indicate a UTI.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Management of atrial fibrillation: The patient is on diltiazem gtt and digoxin loading, with plans to convert to PO metoprolol and continue digoxin.
2. Management of hip fracture: The patient's daughter does not want surgical intervention, and the patient is likely headed towards comfort care.
3. Management of UTI: The patient is on cipro IV and will be transitioned to PO when able. The urine culture is pending.
4. Management of abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to constipation, and she will be monitored closely.
5. Management of NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels are trending downward, and she will be managed with ASA and high-dose statin.
6. Management of fall: The patient's fall is thought to be related to osteoporosis, and she will be monitored for further signs of injury.
7. Management of anemia: The patient's Hct is trending downward, and she will be monitored for signs of bleeding.
8. Management of respiratory alkalosis: The patient's hyperventilation is likely due to pain and agitation, and she will be monitored for signs of respiratory distress.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and NSTEMI increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and respiratory arrest.
3. Infectious complications: The patient's UTI and elevated lactate level increase her risk of infectious complications, such as sepsis and organ failure.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and constipation increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction and perforation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and delirium increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and elevated troponin levels increase her risk of hematological complications, such as bleeding and organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - ASA, high dose statin.  Switch back to beta-blocker from diltiazem
   gtt.
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.  ? diffuse pain.
   - C spine cleared by trauma team.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Further work-up of fall will be held pending clarification of goals
   of care.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Continue to rise, predominantly PMN
s without bands.
   Likely stress response and UTI.  Need C.diff though patient not
   stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.  Limiting fentanyl as possible.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, hip fracture, myocardial infarction, and chronic conditions such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma. She has been experiencing abdominal pain, right arm/shoulder pain, and is at risk for further complications due to her advanced age and multiple comorbidities.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is difficult to control, and she has been experiencing episodes of hypotension. Her hip fracture is not being surgically managed, and she is being considered for comfort care. Her abdominal pain is likely due to constipation, but further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes.

The patient's myocardial infarction is considered to be demand ischemia related to her acute fracture, rather than an acute coronary syndrome event. She has been prescribed aspirin and a high-dose statin, and will be switched back to a beta-blocker from diltiazem.

The patient's fall is being investigated, and further work-up will be held pending clarification of her goals of care. She has multiple fractures on imaging, and her neck and arm pain may be related to these injuries.

The patient's anemia is slowly trending down, and her daughter has declined consent for blood transfusions. Her urinary tract infection is being treated with ciprofloxacin, and she will be transitioned to oral medication when able.

The patient's respiratory alkalosis is likely due to hyperventilation related to pain and agitation, and her leukocytosis is likely a stress response and UTI. She is at risk for Clostridioides difficile infection, and will need further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium related to her fall, fracture, infection, and medications. She will need frequent reorientation and minimization of mood-altering medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation is difficult to control, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications.
2. Infection: The patient's UTI and potential C. difficile infection put her at risk for sepsis and other complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory alkalosis and hyperventilation put her at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's anemia and potential bleeding risks from her fractures and medications put her at risk for hemorrhage.
5. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and potential C. difficile infection put her at risk for sepsis and other complications.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and potential delirium put her at risk for further cognitive decline and complications.
7. Worsening of comorbidities: The patient's multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma, may worsen with further complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient will need close monitoring and management of her medical conditions, as well as coordination with her family and healthcare team to ensure that her goals of care are met."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - ASA, high dose statin.  Switch back to beta-blocker from diltiazem
   gtt.
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.  ? diffuse pain.
   - C spine cleared by trauma team.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Further work-up of fall will be held pending clarification of goals
   of care.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Continue to rise, predominantly PMN
s without bands.
   Likely stress response and UTI.  Need C.diff though patient not
   stooling.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular disease, chronic urinary frequency, and prior hip fracture. She was admitted to the ICU after falling and sustaining a new hip fracture, as well as a urinary tract infection (UTI). She also has atrial fibrillation, which is difficult to control, and has been converted back to sinus rhythm. The patient's abdominal pain is unclear in origin, and her lactate levels are mildly elevated. She has a history of constipation and may be experiencing constipation-related abdominal pain. The patient's troponin levels peaked at 0.13 but have trended downward, suggesting demand ischemia rather than an acute coronary syndrome event.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
	* The patient's history of CAD and prior CVA increases her risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hyperventilation due to pain, agitation, or respiratory alkalosis may lead to respiratory failure.
	* The patient's history of COPD or chronic respiratory disease may increase her risk of respiratory complications.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or complications related to bowel management.
	* The patient's history of chronic urinary frequency and UTI may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications.
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Delirium may lead to confusion, disorientation, and increased risk of falls or other accidents.
	* The patient's history of prior CVA and chronic urinary frequency may increase her risk of neurological complications.
5. Infection-related Complications:
	* UTI may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or other complications.
	* The patient's history of chronic urinary frequency and UTI may increase her risk of infection-related complications.
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
	* The patient's history of chronic urinary frequency and UTI may increase her risk of hematological complications.
7. Orthopedic Complications:
	* Hip fracture may lead to further complications, such as nonunion, malunion, or osteomyelitis.
	* The patient's history of prior hip fracture and osteoporosis may increase her risk of orthopedic complications.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.

   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the hospital with a new hip fracture and atrial fibrillation (AFib) after a fall. She has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma. She is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of AFib, myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and abdominal pain.

The patient's medical history is significant for a hip fracture, which was treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and a history of chronic urinary frequency. She has a GNR UTI and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. She also has a history of falls and has suffered a recent fall from the commode, which resulted in a right femoral fracture.

The patient's current condition is complicated by her AFib, which has not converted with medication, and her elevated troponin levels, which are thought to be related to demand ischemia rather than an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She is also experiencing abdominal pain, which is thought to be related to her UTI and possibly an abdominal process.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, which is thought to be related to her UTI and possibly an abdominal process. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, and she is anemic. Her troponin levels are elevated, but are trending downward.

The patient's plan is to continue treatment for her AFib, UTI, and abdominal pain. She will also be evaluated for possible surgery for her hip fracture. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her family has been consulted and is aware of her condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's AFib and elevated troponin levels increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
2. Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count increase her risk of abdominal complications, such as perforation, abscess, and sepsis.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and pneumonia.
4. Infection: The patient's UTI and elevated white blood cell count increase her risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's low platelet count and elevated troponin levels increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's poor oral intake and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels increase her risk of nutritional complications, such as malnutrition and anemia.
7. Pressure ulcer complications: The patient's immobility and poor circulation increase her risk of pressure ulcer complications, such as skin breakdown and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  In the
   meantime, patient may be approaching
   History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted fracture of distal
   femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.  Preoperative risk
   assessment - patient is currently high risk for surgery with at least
   one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac morbidity with evidence
   of elevated troponins/active myocardial ischemia (though this likely is
   reflective of increased demand).  However, she has a significant
   femoral fracture necessitating operative repair if in line with goals
   of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  PMN
s without bands.  Likely stress response and UTI.
   Need C.diff though patient not stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  PMN
s without bands.  Likely stress response and UTI.
   Need C.diff though patient not stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

Summary:

The patient is an elderly female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the ICU with new-onset atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, and a femoral neck fracture. She has also been experiencing right arm and shoulder pain, and has a history of osteoporosis. The patient's daughter is her healthcare proxy and has expressed a desire for comfort care, rather than surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is difficult to control, and she has not converted with lopressor or diltiazem boluses. She is currently on diltiazem gtt and getting digoxin load.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is difficult to assess, and the etiology is unclear. She has a large amount of stool in her abdomen, and her lactate level is mildly elevated.
3. Hip Fracture: The patient has a femoral neck fracture, and her daughter has expressed a desire for comfort care rather than surgical intervention. The patient is at high risk for surgery, and her elevated troponins may indicate increased demand.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has had a peak troponin level of 0.13, which has trended downward. It is thought to represent demand ischemia, rather than an ACS event.
5. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin. She has a history of chronic urinary frequency and is taking methenamine as a prophylactic measure.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is slowly trending downward, and she may need transfusions if she undergoes surgery.
7. Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient has hyperventilation due to pain and agitation, which is likely causing her respiratory alkalosis.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is likely due to a stress response and UTI.
9. Altered Mental Status: The patient is lethargic, confused, and hypoverbal, which may be due to delirium caused by her fall, fracture, infection, and medications.
10. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be due to pain and stress.
11. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is being treated with levothyroxine.
12. Depression: The patient has depression, which is being treated with bupropion.
13. Glaucoma: The patient has glaucoma, which is being treated with home medications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including cardiac, respiratory, and infectious diseases. Her altered mental status and difficulty with pain management also pose a significant challenge."
