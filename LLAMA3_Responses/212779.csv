You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 157/97 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. She is receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level of 21, but a negative troponin-T test. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 259, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits.

The patient's medical conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, recent MRSA bacteremia, and bipolar disorder. She is also experiencing abdominal pain, which is suspected to be caused by a variety of possibilities, including hepatobiliary disease, pancreatitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and constipation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient will be extubated today, and her respiratory status will be closely monitored. She will also receive repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and urine toxicology testing.
2. Hx PE: The patient's INR will be checked to ensure it is therapeutic.
3. Bipolar disorder: The patient's psychotropic medications will be held, and she will be restarted on citalopram once she is stable.
4. Recent bacteremia: The patient will receive follow-up blood cultures, and her antibiotic treatment will be adjusted based on the results.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient will receive LFTs, amylase, and lipase testing, and her abdominal pain will be monitored for any changes in clinical exam or stool pattern.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis, and a bowel regimen to prevent constipation.
7. Nutrition: The patient will receive nutrition support, and a nutrition consult will be considered after extubation.
8. Access: The patient's peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines will be monitored and maintained.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can progress to respiratory arrest if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal pain can progress to abdominal compartment syndrome, bowel perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess if not managed properly.
4. Psychiatric complications: The patient's bipolar disorder can lead to mood instability, suicidal ideation, or psychotic episodes if not managed properly.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's malnutrition can lead to impaired wound healing, increased risk of infection, and decreased immune function if not managed properly.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 157/97 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 34 inspirations per minute. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a troponin-T level of <0.01 ng/mL, which suggests that she is not experiencing a myocardial infarction. Her carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are elevated, with a partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) of 76 mmHg, which is consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and overweight/obese body habitus. She has a soft and non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present. Her extremities are warm and well-perfused, with decreased reflexes.

The patient's medical history is significant for asthma, DVT, PE, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, which may increase her risk of intracranial bleeding.

The patient's medication list includes various psychotropic medications, including citalopram, depakote, and abilify. She is also receiving antibiotics for her MRSA bacteremia.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Intracranial bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and potential underlying bleeding disorders.
2. Hypoventilation due to asthma, sleep apnea, or sedation from medication or overdose.
3. Respiratory failure due to hypercarbic respiratory failure or underlying lung pathology.
4. Infection due to MRSA bacteremia or other sources.
5. Neurologic complications due to sedation, anticoagulation therapy, or underlying medical conditions.
6. Cardiovascular complications due to anticoagulation therapy, underlying cardiovascular disease, or medication interactions.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care includes:

1. Repeat ABG to assess for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Head CT to rule out intracranial pathology.
3. Tox screen to assess for potential sedative or other medications.
4. Check depakote and lithium levels to assess for potential medication toxicity.
5. Hold depakote and lithium therapy.
6. Check TSH to assess for potential hypothyroidism.
7. Continue anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, but hold it tonight for NPO status.
8. Continue antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia.
9. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's neurologic status and adjust sedation therapy as necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient was extubated and placed on CPAP overnight, which was uneventful. Their vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 152/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 1,421 mL, with a balance of -94 mL. Their respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a Vt of 403 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 264 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 7.6 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 108 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* TCO2: 41
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their condition, but they respond to stimuli and have normal vital signs.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Respiratory failure, which may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Impaired skin integrity, which may lead to pressure ulcers or skin infections
* Acute pain, which may require further pain management
* Impaired glycemic control, which may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
* Potential for DVT or stress ulcer bleeding due to prolonged immobilization
* Potential for VAP or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation and respiratory support."

   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and primary lung pathology with
   hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc). Patient  has no signs or sx
   concerning for intracranial disease.   Over-medication or overdose is
   also possible, but pt denies, and lithium and valproate both negative.
   However, valproic acid can sometimes cause hyperammonemia.  She does
   have recent changes in psych meds that could be sedating. NMS or
   serotonin syndrome can also present with sedatio`n but appears unlikely
   w/o myoclonus, rigidity or fever.   Doing well with pressure support
   - extubate today, with anaesthesia and cart present
   - repeat ABG
   - urine tox
   -hold psych meds for now, but consider re-starting after extubation and
   pt is stable
   # hx PE: INR therapeutic
   - Check INR
   .
   # Bipolar disorder:
   - cont citalopram
   - hold depakote and abilify

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female who was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a history of asthma, DVT/PE, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was recently extubated and is currently on CPAP.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 152/44 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 25 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 87%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a normal sinus rhythm, and her fluid balance is stable.

The patient's physical examination is notable for morbid obesity, and she has a soft abdomen with mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant. She has a recent history of finger dislocation, which has been reduced.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 259 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 11-22 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase of 55 IU/L. Her electrolyte levels are normal, with a sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium of 4.2 mmol/L, and chloride of 97 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely due to her underlying asthma and obesity, rather than intracranial pathology or primary lung pathology. The patient is being managed with pressure support and is expected to be extubated today.
2. Hx PE: The patient's INR is therapeutic, and she will continue to be monitored for any signs of bleeding or clotting.
3. Bipolar disorder: The patient's bipolar disorder is being managed with citalopram, and she will continue to be monitored for any changes in her mental status.
4. Recent bacteremia: The patient's recent bacteremia has been treated with vancomycin, and she will continue to be monitored for any signs of sepsis or infection.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to constipation, but other differential diagnoses such as hepatobiliary disease, pancreatitis, or intra-abdominal abscess cannot be ruled out. The patient will be monitored for any changes in her abdominal exam and stool pattern.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's recent bacteremia can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Intra-abdominal infection: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness can be indicative of an intra-abdominal infection, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Constipation: The patient's constipation can lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation if not managed properly.
5. Mental status changes: The patient's bipolar disorder and recent changes in her psych meds can lead to mental status changes, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's 24-hour events and progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, a 28-year-old morbidly obese female, was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. The patient was extubated and had a brief episode of desaturation to the high 80s, but did well with CPAP overnight.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 152/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 87%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Morbid obesity
* Soft, slightly tender abdomen with pain in the right upper quadrant
* Warm, well-perfused skin with healed scars from cutting behavior
* Neurological examination reveals normal motor function, but reflexes are difficult to assess

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 259 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* TCO2: 41 mmHg
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and plan include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is being treated with non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night and oxygen by nasal cannula as necessary.
* Bipolar disorder: The patient is being continued on citalopram and Depakote and Abilify are being held.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's pain has resolved, and laboratory results are negative for liver function tests, amylase, and lipase.
* Finger dislocation: The patient has undergone reduction and is being followed by orthopedics for splinting.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Nutrition: The patient is being fed regular foods and is being considered for a nutrition consult.
* Access: The patient has PIVs.
* Code status: Full code.
* Disposition: The patient is being discharged to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure could worsen if not managed properly.
* Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia and history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism make her susceptible to infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and history of bleeding could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Neurological complications: The patient's morbid obesity and history of bipolar disorder make her susceptible to neurological complications.
* Wound complications: The patient's history of cutting behavior could lead to wound complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient, a 28-year-old morbidly obese female, was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure following a recent MRSA bacteremia.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a recent episode of desaturation resolved with CPAP overnight.
* The patient has a history of asthma, DVT/Pe, and bipolar disorder, and is currently being treated for abdominal pain, which has resolved.
* The patient has also been diagnosed with a finger dislocation, which has been reduced and is being followed up with orthopedic care.
* The patient's laboratory results show normal values for HCT, ammonia, and other blood tests, with some mild elevations in liver enzymes.
* The patient is being treated with non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night, and oxygen by nasal cannula as necessary.
* The patient's medication regimen includes citalopram for bipolar disorder, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma and recent hypercarbic respiratory failure puts them at risk for future respiratory complications.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's recent abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes may indicate ongoing inflammation or infection, which could lead to further complications.
* DVT/Pe: The patient's history of DVT/Pe puts them at risk for future thrombotic events, which could be exacerbated by immobility or other factors.
* Bipolar disorder: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and current treatment with citalopram may require close monitoring to ensure adequate treatment and minimize the risk of relapse or exacerbation.
* Finger dislocation: The patient's recent finger dislocation may require ongoing orthopedic care and monitoring to ensure proper healing and minimize the risk of complications.
* Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia and ongoing prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer may indicate a risk of future infections, which could be exacerbated by immunosuppressive therapy or other factors."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, secondary to underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, as well as coag-negative sepsis.

The patient has undergone extubation and is currently receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for diminished peripheral pulses and clear breath sounds. She is oriented to person, place, and time, and follows simple commands. Her neurologic examination is otherwise normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 259 K/uL. Her coagulation studies are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying OSA and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome increase her risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she experiences a setback in her respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of coag-negative sepsis increases her risk of developing further septic episodes, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and obesity increase her risk of developing further DVTs, particularly if she is not adequately anticoagulated.
4. Stress ulceration: The patient's critical illness increases her risk of developing stress ulcers, particularly if she is not receiving adequate stress ulcer prophylaxis.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of intubation and mechanical ventilation increases her risk of developing VAP, particularly if she is not receiving adequate ventilation and suctioning.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's critical illness and obesity increase her risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, particularly if she is not receiving adequate nutrition and hydration.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 28-year-old woman, was admitted with chest pain, developed coag-neg staph bacteremia, and was treated with antibiotics. She was intubated due to respiratory failure, with a pCO2 of 120, and was extubated yesterday. She has done well, sleeping with CPAP overnight. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 146/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination reveals an overweight/obese patient with clear breath sounds, attentive and oriented, with diminished peripheral pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying OSA and obesity-hypoventilation may lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Coag-neg sepsis: The patient's history of coag-neg sepsis and ongoing hypercarbic failure may increase the risk of sepsis-related complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and current use of boots for prophylaxis may indicate a risk of recurrent DVT.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of coag-neg sepsis and current use of stress ulcer prophylaxis may indicate a risk of stress ulcer development.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current use of CPAP/PSV and history of intubation may increase the risk of VAP.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's current glycemic control and history of hyperglycemia may indicate a risk of hypoglycemia.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's current electrolyte levels and history of hyperkalemia may indicate a risk of electrolyte imbalances.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's current creatinine level and history of hyperkalemia may indicate a risk of renal dysfunction.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coag-neg sepsis and current use of antibiotics may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's history of coag-neg sepsis and current use of antibiotics may increase the risk of neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 158/84 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night and oxygen by nasal cannula as necessary.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently taking citalopram. Her abdominal pain has resolved, and her liver function tests, amylase, and lipase are negative.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.6-5.2 K/uL
* Hct: 27.7-28.4%
* Plt: 259-302 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 41-43 mmHg
* Glucose: 108-123 mg/dL

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.39, PCO2 of 66 mmHg, PO2 of 67 mmHg, and HCO3 of 41 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia may lead to sepsis or other infections.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and recent psychiatric medication changes may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or altered mental status.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's morbid obesity and recent respiratory failure may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and recent medication changes may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Skin complications: The patient's history of cutting behavior may lead to skin complications such as infections or scarring.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's morbid obesity and recent respiratory failure may lead to nutritional complications such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and treatment for her respiratory failure, infection, and other potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing agitation, chest pain, and refusal to wear a bipap mask. She has been treated with various medications, including psychotropic agents, and has been placed on non-invasive CPAP/BIPAP at night.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if she continues to refuse CPAP/BIPAP therapy or if her underlying lung disease is not adequately managed.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's morbid obesity and history of DVT/PE put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and pulmonary embolism.
3. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia and history of DVT/PE make her susceptible to further infections, particularly in the context of central venous catheters and mechanical ventilation.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's agitation and refusal to cooperate with medical interventions may be indicative of underlying neurological issues, such as intracranial pathology or medication-related side effects.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's morbid obesity and history of DVT/PE may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Psychiatric Complications: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder may contribute to her agitation and refusal to cooperate with medical interventions, and may require ongoing psychiatric management and support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide non-invasive CPAP/BIPAP therapy as necessary.
2. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist or critical care specialist to optimize respiratory management.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider echocardiography or other imaging studies to evaluate cardiac function.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider neuroimaging studies to evaluate for intracranial pathology.
5. Consider consultation with a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal status and potential risks for complications.
6. Continue to provide psychiatric support and management to the patient, including ongoing medication management and therapy sessions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her current medications include citalopram, depakote, and abilify. She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been experiencing abdominal pain, which has resolved. She also has a finger dislocation that has been reduced.

Vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 98 bpm (78-115 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 158/84 mmHg (98-174/112 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 33 inspirations per minute (14-37 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 7.6-5.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 259-302 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Lactic acid: 2.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to primary lung pathology, hypoventilation, or respiratory drive from intracranial pathology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
* Bipolar disorder: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and current medication regimen may increase the risk of mood instability and suicidal behavior.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, but further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and potential complications.
* Finger dislocation: The patient's finger dislocation has been reduced, but further evaluation is needed to determine the potential for long-term complications.
* DVT/PE: The patient's history of DVT/PE increases the risk of recurrent thromboembolic events.
* MRSA bacteremia: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia may increase the risk of sepsis and organ failure.

Recommendations:

* Continue non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night and oxygen by nasal cannula as necessary.
* Hold depakote and abilify and continue citalopram.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary.
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Consider a nutrition consult to optimize the patient's nutrition.
* Monitor the patient's finger dislocation and provide orthopedic follow-up as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old woman with morbid obesity, severe depression, and a history of suicide attempts. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She was agitated and asked for Ambien, leading to a Code Purple call and return to the MICU. She was started on Abilify and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and antihistamines. She has a PICC line and is receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/59 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on CPAP. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 302 K/uL.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute pain, and respiratory failure. She requires pain control, wound care, and respiratory support. The plan includes continuing Abilify, discussing medication needs with psych for discharge home, and determining the services she will need upon discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of respiratory failure and morbid obesity, she is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and potential presence of a PICC line increase her risk for developing sepsis.
3. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases her risk for developing a wound infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
5. Medication side effects: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, which may have side effects that need to be monitored.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's morbid obesity and respiratory failure may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly managed.
7. Depression: The patient's severe depression may worsen if not properly managed, leading to suicidal ideation and behavior."

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old woman with morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation, and severe depression. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and was intubated. She was agitated and asked for Ambien, leading to a Code Purple being called. She was started on Abilify, and her PICC line was inserted. She is currently receiving invasive ventilation and is being managed with various medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still experiencing respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and she may require continued invasive ventilation and close monitoring.
2. Agitation: The patient's agitation may lead to further complications, such as increased oxygen requirements, hypertension, or even cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Worsening of Obesity Hypoventilation: The patient's morbid obesity may worsen her respiratory failure, leading to further complications.
4. Skin Integrity Issues: The patient's obesity and immobility may increase her risk of developing skin integrity issues, such as pressure ulcers or skin breakdown.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and invasive ventilation may increase her risk of developing an infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's obesity and hypertension may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's obesity and immobility may lead to nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or dehydration.
8. Psychiatric Complications: The patient's severe depression and agitation may lead to psychiatric complications, such as suicidal ideation or behavior."

   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Wore CPAP
   for ~2 hours last night.  Did receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory
   status will not change while in hospital and is not likely going to
   improve if patient does not wear CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   - pt cleared medical for discharge
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont citalopram
   - hold depakote and abilify
   # abd pain- Has resolved, negative LFTs, amylase, and lipase
   .
   # Finger dislocation: s/p reducation and splitting
   - ortho following; pt. needs follow-up appointment with them 2 weeks
   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN:  regular foods
   - consider nutrition consult
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
   .
   #) Code Status: Full
   .
   #) Dispo: pending psych eval, pt does not want to return home.  Will
   discuss with case management.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and is currently on non-invasive ventilation with CPAP. She has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP, and wore it for approximately 2 hours last night. Her respiratory status is not likely to improve if she does not wear CPAP at home.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if she does not wear CPAP or BIPAP at home.
2. OSA: The patient's OSA may lead to further respiratory compromise if not properly managed with CPAP or BIPAP.
3. DVT/PE: The patient's history of DVT/PE may increase her risk of developing further thrombotic events if not properly managed with anticoagulation therapy.
4. MRSA bacteremia: The patient's recent MRSA bacteremia may lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction if not properly managed with antibiotics.
5. Psychiatric issues: The patient's history of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and difficulty following medical advice may lead to further complications if not properly managed with psychiatric therapy.
6. Finger dislocation: The patient's finger dislocation may lead to further complications if not properly managed with orthopedic follow-up and pain management.
7. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to a underlying medical condition and may worsen if not properly managed with further evaluation and treatment.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications if not properly managed with insulin therapy.
9. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid imbalance may lead to further complications if not properly managed with fluid management therapy.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's respiratory status is not likely to improve if she does not wear CPAP or BIPAP at home. The patient's psychiatric issues need to be properly managed with psychiatric therapy. The patient's finger dislocation needs to be properly managed with orthopedic follow-up and pain management. The patient's abdominal pain needs to be further evaluated and treated. The patient's hyperglycemia needs to be properly managed with insulin therapy. The patient's fluid imbalance needs to be properly managed with fluid management therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with CPAP and has been tolerating it well, with only mild desaturation. However, she has been refusing CPAP overnight and has required oxygen supplementation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, but with morbid obesity. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 110 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 143/86 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 27 inspirations per minute (ipm), and her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 88%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.6 K/uL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypoventilation, obstructive disease, and morbid obesity.
* Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, and is showing limited insight into her medical condition.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and her LFTs, amylase, and lipase levels are normal.
* Finger dislocation: The patient's finger dislocation has been reduced and splinted, and she requires follow-up with an orthopedic specialist.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving regular foods, and consideration is being given to a nutrition consult.
* Access: The patient has multiple peripheral intravenous lines (PIVs) in place.
* Code status: The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is pending a psychiatric evaluation regarding her competency to make decisions and safe placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if she continues to refuse CPAP and oxygen supplementation.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's morbid obesity and hypertension increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
* Infections: The patient's history of MRSA bacteremia and her current respiratory failure increase her risk of developing new infections.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's morbid obesity and decreased mobility increase her risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-calorie malnutrition.
* Psychiatric complications: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder increase her risk of developing psychiatric complications, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/Pe, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status remains unchanged, and she is not likely to improve without wearing CPAP at home. She is currently on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night and oxygen by nasal canula as necessary.

The patient has a history of splitting and trying to strike deals with the medical team, and has limited insight into her medical condition and the danger of low O2 sats and cessation of breathing. She continues to refuse CPAP and ventilator support, but does not want to die. The patient's medical decision-making capacity is being discussed with psychiatry, and placement is pending.

The patient has ongoing issues with abdominal pain, which has resolved, and finger dislocation, which was reduced and splinted. She needs to follow up with orthopedics in two weeks. The patient is also being treated with prophylactic PPI, sc heparin, and bowel regimen, and is receiving regular foods. Nutrition consult is being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if she does not wear CPAP at home.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of MRSA bacteremia and recent antibiotic use may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Wound infection: The patient's extensive scarring from cutting behavior may increase her risk of developing wound infections.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of MRSA bacteremia and recent antibiotic use may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of DVT/Pe and recent MRSA bacteremia may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cutting behavior and recent psychiatric medication regimen may increase her risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and recent antibiotic use may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's history of morbid obesity and recent hospitalization may increase her risk of developing nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of hypercarbia and unresponsiveness, treated with hyperventilation and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The patient has a pending discussion with psychiatry regarding disposition and follow-up recommendations. The patient's orthopedic follow-up is scheduled for two weeks regarding a left digit dislocation. The patient is on dopamine stress testing and NIV support. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown medications.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (82-106 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/63 mmHg (73-169/117 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 6.5-4.4 K/uL
* Hct: 27.1-26.1%
* Plt: 33
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 40-44 mmHg
* Glucose: 126 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 21.0/24.7/2.0, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 21/<0.01, ALT / AST: [11-22], Alk Phos / T Bili: 55/0.2, Amylase / Lipase: 25/18, Lactic Acid: 2.6 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.1 g/dL, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 5.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to: Not assessed, Movement: Not assessed, Tone: Not assessed

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Ineffective coping
* H/O pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is on NIV support, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the support is not adequate.
* Hypoxia: The patient's SpO2 is 94%, which may indicate hypoxia.
* Hypercarbia: The patient had an episode of hypercarbia and unresponsiveness, which may recur if not properly managed.
* Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient's lab results show elevated WBC and CRP, which may indicate sepsis.
* Skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, which may lead to skin breakdown and infection.
* Pain control: The patient's pain control is a concern, as they have a history of acute and chronic pain.
* Orthopedic complications: The patient has a left digit dislocation, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed."

   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Wore CPAP
   for ~2 hours last night.  Did receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory
   status will not change while in hospital and is not likely going to
   improve if patient does not wear CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   - pt cleared medical for discharge
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont citalopram
   - hold depakote and abilify
   # abd pain- Has resolved, negative LFTs, amylase, and lipase
   .
   # Finger dislocation: s/p reducation and splitting
   - ortho following; pt. needs follow-up appointment with them 2 weeks
   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN:  regular foods
   - consider nutrition consult
   .
   #) Access: PIVs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   PICC Line - [**2156-12-12**] 01:00 AM<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: She is on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with a bipap mask, with a tidal volume of 433 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 45%.
* Cardiovascular status: Her blood pressure is 113/63 mmHg, and her heart rate is 92 beats per minute (bpm).
* Neurological status: She is responsive to voice and moves all four extremities, but her skin is warm and well-perfused, and her reflexes are difficult to assess.
* Abdominal status: She has mild tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) and reports pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ).
* Extremities: Her extremities are distal pulse (DP) 2+, with no rigidity or reflexes to assess.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): White blood cell count (WBC) 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) 33 K/uL.
* Electrolyte panel: Sodium (Na) 143 mEq/L, potassium (K) 4.1 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl) 102 mEq/L.
* Blood chemistry: Glucose 126 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) 0.7 mg/dL, and calcium (Ca) 8.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's respiratory status will not improve without proper treatment, including non-invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to her recent MRSA bacteremia and may require further evaluation and treatment.
* Finger dislocation: The patient has a recent finger dislocation that requires follow-up with an orthopedic specialist.
* Prophylaxis: The patient requires prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) with heparin and a bowel regimen.

The patient's psychiatric issues include:

* Limited insight into her medical condition: The patient has difficulty understanding the severity of her condition and the importance of wearing a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask.
* Refusal of CPAP: The patient is reluctant to wear a CPAP mask, which is necessary to improve her respiratory status.
* History of splitting and trying to strike deals with the medical team: The patient has a history of attempting to negotiate with the medical team, which can be a challenge in making medical decisions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
* Oxygen therapy as necessary.
* Discuss with psychiatry regarding the patient's medical decision-making capacity.
* Discuss placement with psychiatry.
* Continue citalopram.
* Hold depakote and abilify.
* Follow-up appointment with an orthopedic specialist.
* Pain management with Tylenol and percocet as needed.
* Prophylaxis with PPI, sc heparin, and bowel regimen.
* Nutrition consult to consider.
* Access via PIVs.
* Code status: Full.
* Disposition: Pending psychiatry evaluation, the patient does not want to return home, and will discuss with case management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), and recent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. She has a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 210 mmHg and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 62 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: Her blood pressure is 132/78 mmHg, and her heart rate is 86 beats per minute.
* Neurological: She is responding to voice commands, moving all four extremities, and following commands appropriately.
* Abdominal: She has slight tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) and complaints of pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ).
* Extremities: Her distal pulses are 2+, and her reflexes are difficult to assess due to her morbid obesity.
* Skin: She has warm, well-perfused skin with extensive scarring from cutting behavior.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 5.2-5.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.8-9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 68-100 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 11-22 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium (Na): 142 mmol/L, potassium (K): 4.8 mmol/L, chloride (Cl): 99 mmol/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3): 28.5 mmol/L
* Glucose: 101-126 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications and potential issues include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is not expected to improve while in the hospital unless she agrees to wear continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at home.
* Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, and she is showing limited insight into her medical condition and is refusing CPAP and ventilator support.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, but she still has complaints of pain in the RUQ.
* Finger dislocation: The patient's finger dislocation has been reduced and splinted, and she needs follow-up with an orthopedic specialist.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and CPAP therapy
* O2 therapy as necessary
* Discussion with the patient's psychiatrist regarding her medical decision-making capacity and placement
* Holding depakote and abilify
* Continuing citalopram
* Follow-up with an orthopedic specialist for the finger dislocation
* Nutrition consult to consider
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Code status: Full
* Disposition: Pending psychiatric evaluation and case management discussion."

   difficult given the number if different medications that the patient is
   already on.  Head CT without contrast unremarkable.  Neuro is
   following, appreciate their recs.
   - EEG
 possibly set-up while patient is sedated then plan to stop
   fentanyl & propofol and extubate patient for better study

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Alkalemic respiratory failure: Etiology of events leading to
   alkalemia and intubation last night are not clear, however, it is
   likely that the patient was having a seizure at the time given her
   downward deviated eyes.  However, seizure prophylaxis would be
   difficult given the number if different medications that the patient is
   already on.  Head CT without contrast unremarkable.  Neuro is
   following, appreciate their recs.
   - EEG
 possibly set-up while patient is sedated then plan to stop
   fentanyl & propofol and extubate patient for better study
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Attempt to wean from vent & extubate today
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Did
   receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory status will not change while in
   hospital and is not likely going to improve if patient does not wear
   CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.  Patient has
   intermittently been refusing her psychiatric meds.  She did accept
   these medicines early yesterday afternoon.  Most of them are not
   crushable and thus she cannot receive them while intubated.
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont all psyche meds (citalopram, depakote, and abilify, etc.)
   # abd pain- Has resolved, negative LFTs, amylase, and lipase
   .
   # Finger dislocation: s/p reducation and splinting.
   - ortho following; pt. needs follow-up appointment with them 2 weeks
   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen, therapeutic on coumadin
 holding
   coumadin for INR of 3.1
   .
   #) FEN:  regular foods when extubated; holding TF in anticipation of
   extubation later today
   - consider nutrition consult
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
   .
   #) Code Status: Full
   .
   #) Dispo: pending psych eval, pt does not want to return home.
   Continuing discussions with case management regarding safe placement
   for patient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and on invasive ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 466 mL. She has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210.
* Cardiovascular: Her blood pressure is 132/78 mmHg, and her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.
* Neurological: She is responsive to voice and moving all four extremities, but her tone and reflexes are difficult to assess due to her obesity.
* Abdominal: She has a soft abdomen with slight tenderness in the left upper quadrant and complains of pain in the right upper quadrant.
* Skin: She has extensive scarring from cutting behavior and is warm and well-perfused.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.2-5.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8-11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 68-100 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 101-126 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Normal
* Lactic acid: 2.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Alkalemic respiratory failure: The etiology of the patient's alkalemia and intubation is unclear, but it is likely related to a seizure or respiratory failure.
* Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory drive may be compromised due to intracranial pathology, new psychiatric medication regimen, or primary lung pathology.
* Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and has limited insight into her medical condition. She refuses CPAP and has difficulty following medical logic.
* Abdominal pain: The patient has a soft abdomen with slight tenderness in the left upper quadrant and complains of pain in the right upper quadrant.
* Skin issues: The patient has extensive scarring from cutting behavior.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning from invasive ventilation and extubation
* Continuing non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night
* O2 by nasal canula as necessary
* Discussing placement with psychiatry regarding the patient's medical decision-making capacity
* Continuing all psychiatric medications
* Follow-up with orthopedics regarding the patient's finger dislocation
* Pain management with Tylenol and percocet as needed
* Considering a nutrition consult
* Continuing discussions with case management regarding safe placement for the patient."

   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/Pe, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Alkalemic respiratory failure: Etiology of events leading to
   alkalemia and intubation last night are not clear, however, it is
   likely that the patient was having a seizure at the time given her
   downward deviated eyes.  However, seizure prophylaxis would be
   difficult given the number if different medications that the patient is
   already on.  Head CT without contrast unremarkable.  Neuro is
   following, appreciate their recs.
   - EEG
 possibly set-up while patient is sedated then plan to stop
   fentanyl & propofol and extubate patient for better study
   - f/u neuro recs
   - Attempt to wean from vent & extubate today
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Did
   receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory status will not change while in
   hospital and is not likely going to improve if patient does not wear
   CPAP at home.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt to
   be have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.  Patient has
   intermittently been refusing her psychiatric meds.  She did accept
   these medicines early yesterday afternoon.  Most of them are not
   crushable and thus she cannot receive them while intubated.
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont all psyche meds (citalopram, depakote, and abilify, etc.)
   # abd pain- Has resolved, negative LFTs, amylase, and lipase
   .
   # Finger dislocation: s/p reducation and splinting.
   - ortho following; pt. needs follow-up appointment with them 2 weeks
   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen, therapeutic on coumadin
 holding
   coumadin for INR of 3.1
   .
   #) FEN:  regular foods when extubated; holding TF in anticipation of
   extubation later today
   - consider nutrition consult
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
   .
   #) Code Status: Full
   .
   #) Dispo: pending psych eval, pt does not want to return home.
   Continuing discussions with case management regarding safe placement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent MRSA bacteremia, who was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated and received fentanyl and propofol for sedation. The patient's respiratory status is being managed with non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night, and O2 by nasal cannula as necessary. She has a history of psychiatric issues, including bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, and is refusing CPAP and ventilator support. The patient has also been refusing her psychiatric medications, but accepted them early yesterday afternoon.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alkalemic respiratory failure: The patient's etiology of events leading to alkalemia and intubation is unclear, and it is likely that she was having a seizure at the time given her downward deviated eyes.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory drive may be impaired due to intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen, and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD, etc.).
3. DVT/Pe: The patient has a history of DVT/Pe, and prophylaxis is being taken.
4. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has a recent history of MRSA bacteremia, and antibiotic treatment is ongoing.
5. OSA: The patient has a history of OSA, and is at risk of low O2 sats and cessation of breathing.
6. Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of psychiatric issues, including bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, which may impact her medical decision-making capacity.
7. Pain management: The patient has reported abdominal pain, which has resolved, and is being managed with Tylenol and Percocet PRN.
8. FEN: The patient is being fed through a tube, and is holding TF in anticipation of extubation later today.
9. Access: The patient has PIVs in place for medication administration.
10. Code status: The patient has a full code status, which means that every effort will be made to resuscitate her in the event of a cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night, and O2 by nasal cannula as necessary.
2. Discuss with psych regarding patient's medical decision-making capacity.
3. Discuss placement with psych.
4. Continue all psyche meds (citalopram, depakote, and abilify, etc.).
5. Consider nutrition consult.
6. Ortho follow-up for finger dislocation.
7. Pain management with Tylenol and Percocet PRN as needed.
8. Monitor patient's respiratory status closely for signs of worsening respiratory failure.
9. Continue antibiotic treatment for MRSA bacteremia.
10. Continue prophylaxis for DVT/Pe."

   Assessment and Plan
   28F morbidly obese female with hx asthma, h/o of DVT/PE, recent MRSA
   bacteremia being transfered to the ICU for unresponsiveness and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   # Alkalemic respiratory failure: Etiology of events leading to
   alkalemia and intubation on [**11-13**] are not clear.  Patient was
   successfully extubated yesterday.  Neuro does not feel that the patient
   had a seizure.  Their recommendation is for head and neck CT based on
   PE & subjective complaints of patient, however, her subjective
   complaints are quite variable.  Head & neck CT not performed last night
   secondary to patient agitation.  Would appreciate if neuro could
   re-examine patient today to decide whether these studies are truly
   necessary.  Patient
s symptoms and respiratory issues may be, in part,
   secondary to her psychotropic medications.
   - EEG
 awaiting results of study
   - f/u neuro recs
   .
   #) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: DDX includes [**Month (only) **] respiratory drive
   from intracranial pathology and/or new psychiatric medication regimen
   and primary lung pathology with hypoventilation (asthma, COPD,etc).
   Pt. transferred to floor, but unable to stay secondary to agitation.
   Has been bargaining for Ambien while agreeing to wear CPAP.  Did
   receive Ambien.  Patient
s respiratory status will not change while in
   hospital and is not likely going to improve if patient does not wear
   CPAP at home.  Patient continues to intermittently refuse to wear CPAP.
   -continue on non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
   -O2 by nasal canula as necesssary
   .
   # Psyche issues/ Bipolar / borderline personality disorder:  Pt. shows
   limited insight to her medical condition of OSA and danger of low O2
   sats and cessation of breathing.  She continues to refuse the CPAP, but
   also refuses ventilator support, but also does not want to die.  Has
   difficulty following the logic of her illness despite multiple attempts
   to explain.  Pt. has history of splitting and trying to
strike deals
   with medical team.  Had been evaluated during code purple and felt not
   to have capacity at that time to make medical decisions.  Patient has
   intermittently been refusing her psychiatric meds.  She did take most
   of her medications last night, but routinely refuses her morning
   depakote dose and is only taking it at night.  Ongoing concern that her
   psychiatric regimen may be contributing to her respiratory issues.
   - discuss with psych patient
s medication regimen and whether meds can
   be further streamlined
   - discuss with psych regarding patient
s medical decision-making
   capacity
   - discuss placement with psych
   - cont all psych meds for now (citalopram, depakote, and abilify, etc.)

   after [**2156-12-6**].
   - pain management with Tylenol, percocet PRN

   # Chest pain
 likely related to anxiety and shortness of breath.  Do
   not feel that it is cardiac in origin or that any kind of stress test
   or cardiac imaging is clinically indicated.  Dobutamine and p-MIBI
   studies would be limited secondary to body habitus.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of asthma, DVT/PE, and recent MRSA bacteremia. She was transferred to the ICU for unresponsiveness and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday. The patient's symptoms and respiratory issues may be secondary to her psychotropic medications. She has limited insight into her medical condition and continues to refuse CPAP, despite being at risk of low O2 sats and cessation of breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Alkalemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if she does not wear CPAP at home.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory drive may be impaired due to intracranial pathology or new psychiatric medication regimen.
3. Psychiatric issues: The patient's refusal of CPAP and ventilator support may be related to her borderline personality disorder and lack of insight into her medical condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment and management.
5. Infection: The patient's history of MRSA bacteremia and recent respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing further infections.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of DVT/PE and recent respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of intracranial pathology and recent respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing neurological complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal pain and recent respiratory failure may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive CPAP or BIPAP at night.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Discuss the patient's medication regimen with her psychiatrist to streamline her medications and improve her respiratory status.
4. Discuss the patient's medical decision-making capacity with her psychiatrist and consider placement in a psychiatric facility.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's psychiatric symptoms and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Consider a head and neck CT scan to rule out intracranial pathology.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider a comprehensive tox screen to rule out underlying infections or toxins."
