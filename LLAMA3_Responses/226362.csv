   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMH, p/w chest pain, found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCX total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting.
   .
   # s/p STEMI:
   Diffuse disease, with thrombotic occlusion of proximal LAD and LCX
   requiring 5 stents to restore flow. IABP placed for high risk PCI and
   maintained for pump support.  Cardiac enzymes trending down. Blood
   pressures appear to be stable when non-augmented  with IABP paused, but
   need to give heart a rest while recovering.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, Integrilin
   - high dose statin
   - hold beta blockers b/c pt needs full inotropic function of heart
   - f/u HgA1C and lipid panel for secondary prevention
   - family discussion
   # Cardiogenic Shock:
   Not perfusing kidneys well, urine output dropping off.  Started
   milrinone to help w urine output and blood pressures.
   -          uptitrate milrinone while monitoring for arrhythmia
   -          monitor urine output
   -          f/u TTE this AM
   .
   # Abdominal Pain:
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia w hx of atherosclerosis, manipulation
   in vessels yesterday and current IABP.
   -          check lactate
   -          abdominal CT
   .
   # Back Pain:
   Hematocrit has been stable, so not likely RP bleed, though possible she
   has had a small dissection.
   -          CT abdomen
   .
   # Acute Systolic Heart Failure:
   BP stable on IABP on 1:1, which was placed during PCI because of left
   main disease, no pressors. RHC pressures consistent with left heart
   failure, confirmed by bedside echo. Question of left to right
   intracardiac shunt because of step up right sided oxygenation noted
   during cath.  Prelim Bedside Echo during cath did not show any obvious
   shunt.
   - f/u full TTE this AM
   - wean IABP as tolerated tomorrow
   - continue heparin drip while IABP in place
   - monitor peripheral perfusion
   - avoid BB
   - will eventually require ACEi given depressed EF
   - likely will need bridge to coumadin for akinetic regions
   .
   # Anxiety :
   -          needs encouragement, has responded to morphine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 87-year-old female who presented with a STEMI and was found to have 3V CAD with thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCX, requiring 5 stents to restore flow. She was started on ASA, Plavix, Integrilin, and a high-dose statin. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, and her blood pressures appear to be stable when not augmented with the IABP.

The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, with urine output dropping off, and has been started on milrinone to help with urine output and blood pressures. She is also experiencing abdominal pain, which is being evaluated for potential mesenteric ischemia, and back pain, which is being evaluated for possible hemodynamic instability.

The patient's physical examination reveals a frail elderly female who is anxious and appears to be in cardiogenic shock. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/43 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her lung examination reveals bilateral crackles at the bases, and her abdominal examination is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 36.6%, and platelet count of 396 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 23.90 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's urine output is dropping off, and she is experiencing hypotension, which can lead to further deterioration in her cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain and history of atherosclerosis make it likely that she is at risk for mesenteric ischemia, which can lead to bowel infarction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's back pain and history of atherosclerosis make it possible that she has had a small dissection or has hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further deterioration in her cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Acute systolic heart failure: The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, but she is still experiencing left heart failure, which can lead to further deterioration in her cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which can exacerbate her symptoms and make it more difficult to manage her condition.

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with ongoing evaluation and treatment of her cardiogenic shock, mesenteric ischemia, hemodynamic instability, acute systolic heart failure, and anxiety."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male who presented with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) and was found to have 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with thrombotic occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. The patient underwent stenting and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, with troponin-T levels of 23.90 ng/mL, and abnormal blood work, including a white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 36.6%, and platelet count of 396 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the fact that many of the vital signs and examination findings are not assessed. However, the patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his SpO2 is 95%.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute systolic heart failure: The patient's blood pressure is stable on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and his right heart catheterization (RHC) pressures are consistent with left heart failure. A full transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned, and the patient will require diuresis to remove pulmonary edema.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and has a SpO2 of 95% on 6 liters of oxygen. His RHC and physical examination are consistent with left heart failure.
3. Question of left-to-right intracardiac shunt: The patient has a step-up in oxygenation on the right side, which may indicate a left-to-right intracardiac shunt. A bedside echocardiogram did not show any obvious shunt, and a TTE is planned to evaluate for an atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD).
4. Potential for bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, and there is a risk of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and aspirin.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Plan a full TTE to evaluate for cardiac function and potential shunts.
4. Consider surgical intervention to correct the patient's cardiac anatomy.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy as necessary to manage his heart failure.
6. Consider bridging the patient to coumadin for akinetic regions after the echocardiogram is finalized.
7. Monitor the patient's peripheral perfusion and adjust therapy as necessary to manage his hypoxia.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk patient with multiple medical complications, including acute systolic heart failure, hypoxia, and potential for bleeding. Close monitoring and aggressive management of his condition are necessary to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMH, p/w chest pain, found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCX total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting.
   .
   # s/p STEMI:
   Diffuse disease, with thrombotic occlusion of proximal LAD and LCX
   requiring 5 stents to restore flow. IABP placed for high risk PCI and
   maintained for pump support.  Cardiac enzymes trending down.
   - Continue ASA, Plavix, Integrillin
   - high dose statin
   - hold beta blockers b/c pt needs full inotropic function of heart
   - f/u HgA1C and lipid panel for secondary prevention
   - given 3VD may discuss surgical intervention although now partially
   corrected
   .
   # Question of Left to Right Intracardiac Shunt:
   Question of left to right intracardiac shunt because of step up right
   sided oxygenation noted during cath.  Prelim Bedside Echo during cath
   did not show any obvious shunt.
   - TTE in AM to eval for ASD or VSD
   .
   # Acute Systolic Heart Failure:
   BP stable on IABP on 1:1, which was placed during PCI because of left
   main disease, no pressors. RHC pressures consistent with left heart
   failure, confirmed by bedside echo (see above)
   - full TTE this AM
   - Lasix prn to remove pulmonary edema
   - wean IABP as tolerated
   - continue heparin drip while IABP in place
   - monitor peripheral perfusion
   - avoid BB to allow tachycardia.
   - will eventually require ACEi given depressed EF
   - likely will need bridge to coumadin for akinetic regions after ECHO
   read finalized

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history, who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries due to total thrombotic occlusion. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.1°F, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 84/43 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, and she is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.

The patient has a question of left-to-right intracardiac shunt, which will be evaluated with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) in the morning. She also has acute systolic heart failure, which is being managed with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, diuretics, and vasodilators. The patient's blood pressure is stable on IABP support, and her cardiac output is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Left-to-right intracardiac shunt: If left untreated, this condition can lead to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and death.
2. Acute systolic heart failure: If not adequately managed, this condition can lead to cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and death.
3. Hypoxia: If not adequately managed, this condition can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
4. Pulmonary edema: If not adequately managed, this condition can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and indwelling catheters make her susceptible to infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and antiplatelet therapy make her susceptible to bleeding complications, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, but she is still at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death."

   Mg++:1.9 mg/dL, PO4:4.1 mg/dL
   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
   minimal decrease
   in extent and density of the pre-existing predominantly perihilar
   opacities.  Also improved is the left retrocardiac opacity. Slightly
   increased, however, is the pre-existing right basal opacity. Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged position of the intra-aortic
   balloon pump.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   septum, anterior wall and the distal/apical LV segments. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 25%). The estimated cardiac index is
   borderline low (2.0 L/min/m2) while on IABP at 1:1. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is
   no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
   and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
   c/w proximal LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP,
   borderline cardiac output on IABP at 1:1 and mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis with IABP in place
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output. Blood pressures appear to be stable
   off IABP.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - d/c integrilin
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function) and ACEi (needs
   pressure)
   - d/c IABP today - follow closely
   - will need long term anticoagulation due to apical akinesis -
   currently on heparin gtt, may need to bridge to coumadin if benefits
   outweight risks, will eval today
   - continue tele
   - follow up HgbA1C and lipid panel
   - PT consult in future
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - d/c IABP per above
   - continue milrinone for now
   - may need second pressor - add as tolerated
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] creatinine
   - IVF as respiratory status tolerates

   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   - f/u CTAP
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mg++:1.9 mg/dL, PO4:4.1 mg/dL
   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
   minimal decrease
   in extent and density of the pre-existing predominantly perihilar
   opacities.  Also improved is the left retrocardiac opacity. Slightly
   increased, however, is the pre-existing right basal opacity. Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged position of the intra-aortic
   balloon pump.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   septum, anterior wall and the distal/apical LV segments. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 25%). The estimated cardiac index is
   borderline low (2.0 L/min/m2) while on IABP at 1:1. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is
   no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
   and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
   c/w proximal LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP,
   borderline cardiac output on IABP at 1:1 and mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD

   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis with IABP in place
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output. Blood pressures appear to be stable
   off IABP.

   - continue milrinone for now
   - may need second pressor - add as tolerated
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates

   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with no prior medical history (PMH) who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is complex and critical. She has extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w proximal LAD disease, with mild mitral regurgitation, elevated LVEDP, and borderline cardiac output on IABP at 1:1 and mild pulmonary hypertension. She is on milrinone to improve urine output, which has decreased despite fluid boluses.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is not perfusing her kidneys well, and her urine output has continued to decline despite milrinone and fluid boluses.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is relatively stable, but her urine output is decreased, which may indicate impending renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires 5L NC, which has increased from prior days, and her SpO2 is 93%, indicating potential respiratory compromise.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is stable off IABP, but she may require second pressor to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Infection: The patient has a Foley catheter and is at risk for urinary tract infections (UTIs). She also has a nasogastric tube (NG) and is at risk for respiratory infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy (heparin) and has a risk of bleeding, particularly with her apical akinesis.
7. Anxiety: The patient is anxious and requires reassurance often, which may impact her mental status and overall well-being.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's cardiac condition may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate her condition.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continue aspirin and Plavix
2. Discontinue integrilin
3. Continue high-dose statin
4. Hold beta blocker and ACEi
5. Discontinue IABP today and follow closely
6. Continue tele
7. Follow up HgbA1C and lipid panel
8. PT consult in the future

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Mg++:1.9 mg/dL, PO4:4.1 mg/dL
   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
   minimal decrease
   in extent and density of the pre-existing predominantly perihilar
   opacities.  Also improved is the left retrocardiac opacity. Slightly
   increased, however, is the pre-existing right basal opacity. Unchanged
   size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged position of the intra-aortic
   balloon pump.
   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
   septum, anterior wall and the distal/apical LV segments. The remaining
   segments contract normally (LVEF = 25%). The estimated cardiac index is
   borderline low (2.0 L/min/m2) while on IABP at 1:1. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
   an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is
   no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
   and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
   c/w proximal LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP,
   borderline cardiac output on IABP at 1:1 and mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis with IABP in place
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output. Blood pressures appear to be stable
   off IABP.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - d/c integrilin
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function) and ACEi (needs
   pressure)
   - d/c IABP today - follow closely
   - cordis with swan ganz catheter
   - will need long term anticoagulation due to apical akinesis -
   currently on heparin gtt, may need to bridge to coumadin if benefits
   outweight risks, will eval today
   - continue tele
   - follow up HgbA1C and lipid panel
   - PT consult in future
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - d/c IABP per above
   - place central access
   - continue milrinone for now
   - may need second pressor - add as tolerated
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] creatinine
   - IVF as respiratory status tolerates
   - continue milrinone
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   - f/u CTAP
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Summary:**

The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history (PMH) who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCX total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU with extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis.

**Current Condition:**

The patient is experiencing:

1. Cardiogenic shock with decreased urine output, requiring milrinone and fluid boluses.
2. Abdominal pain, possibly secondary to hematolysis from the balloon pump.
3. Back pain, likely secondary to hemolysis from the balloon pump.
4. Anxiety, requiring reassurance and occasional use of ativan.
5. Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and possible need for increased oxygen requirements.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's urine output has decreased despite milrinone and fluid boluses, which may indicate worsening cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but further decline in urine output could lead to renal failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's increased lactate levels and decreased urine output may indicate sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for increased oxygen requirements and possible need for mechanical ventilation may indicate respiratory failure.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and decreased platelet count may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
6. Infectious complications: The patient's central line and balloon pump may increase the risk of infectious complications, such as bacteremia or sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's extensive regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and apical akinesis may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue milrinone and fluid boluses to support cardiac function and urine output.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine levels closely.
3. Consider adding a second pressor agent if the patient's blood pressures remain unstable.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and oxygen requirements closely.
5. Consider placing a central access line to facilitate further management.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist and intensivist to further manage the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed
   yesterday.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output, but cardiac output on and off
   milrinone was unchanged. Blood pressures appear to be stable off IABP.
   Wedge pressures yesterday showed increase LA filling pressures,
   therefore she was diuresed.  This morning showed increased SVR and
   decreased cardiac output after metoprolol.

   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function)
   - will consider low dose lisinopril do decrease afterload.
   - continue tele
   - PT consult today
   - plan for even I/O today.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history (PMH) who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 97/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 33.6%
* Platelet count: 261 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 14.92 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L

The patient has been experiencing decreased urine output, requiring diuresis with lasix, and has had multiple fluid boluses. She is also receiving IV milrinone to help with urine output and pressures. Her cardiac output is decreased, and she is requiring 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Cardiogenic shock: Not perfusing kidneys well
* Decreased urine output: Urine output has decreased despite milrinone and fluid boluses
* Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology
* Back pain: Hematocrit trended down slightly, no evidence of RP or dissection on CT
* Anxiety: Need reassurance often, responded to morphine in the past

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiogenic shock: Continued decreased cardiac output and perfusion of vital organs
* Decreased urine output: Further decline in kidney function and potential need for dialysis
* Abdominal pain: Potential for intestinal ischemia or perforation
* Back pain: Potential for hemolysis from balloon pump
* Anxiety: Potential for increased stress and anxiety levels

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue aspirin and plavix
* Continue high-dose statin
* Hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function)
* Consider low-dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
* Continue tele
* PT consult today
* Plan for even I/O today
* Monitor urine output and IVF prn if tolerates
* Monitor blood pressures
* Give lasix as needed
* Social work for anxiety
* ICU care for continued monitoring and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed
   yesterday.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output, but cardiac output on and off
   milrinone was unchanged. Blood pressures appear to be stable off IABP.
   Wedge pressures yesterday showed increase LA filling pressures,
   therefore she was diuresed.  This morning showed increased SVR and
   decreased cardiac output after metoprolol.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function)
   - will consider low dose lisinopril do decrease afterload.
   - continue tele
   - PT consult today
   - plan for even I/O today.
   - transition from heparin gtt to lovenox later this pm.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] creatinine
   - will give lasix as needed.
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history (PMH), who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and total thrombotic occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. She underwent stenting and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current condition is marked by:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is not perfusing her kidneys well, and her urine output has decreased despite treatment with milrinone and fluid boluses.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient's creatinine levels are relatively stable, but her urine output has decreased, and she requires frequent fluid boluses.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing vague abdominal symptoms, and a computed tomography angiography (CTAP) did not reveal any clear signs of pathology.
4. Back pain: The patient's hematocrit levels have trended down slightly, and she may be experiencing hemolysis from the balloon pump.
5. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety and requires reassurance.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, but she may still be at risk for cardiac tamponade.
2. Sepsis: The patient's decreased urine output and increased creatinine levels may indicate sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output and increasing creatinine levels may indicate renal failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her cardiogenic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and decreased urine output may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's decreased urine output and increasing creatinine levels may indicate infection.
7. Hemorrhage: The patient's decreased hematocrit levels may indicate hemorrhage.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in her condition, and treatment should be adjusted accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed
   yesterday.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP placed
   due to high risk PCI and maintained for pump support. Cardiac enzymes
   trending down although appears to be large MI. Put on milrinone in
   attempt to increase urine output, but cardiac output on and off
   milrinone was unchanged. Blood pressures appear to be stable off IABP.
   Wedge pressures yesterday showed increase LA filling pressures,
   therefore she was diuresed.  This morning showed increased SVR and
   decreased cardiac output after metoprolol.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - hold beta blocker (needs inotropic function)
   - will consider low dose lisinopril do decrease afterload.
   - continue tele
   - PT consult today
   - plan for even I/O today.
   - transition from heparin gtt to lovenox later this pm.
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. On milrinone to help
   with urine output and pressures. Urine output has continued to declined
   despite milrinine and fluid boluses. Also requiring 5L NC which has
   increased from prior days.
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had her foley replaced. Multiple
   fluid boluses and on IV milrinone. Despite these efforts urine output
   has decreased. Her creatinine is relative stable.
   - [**Name2 (NI) 1174**] creatinine
   - will give lasix as needed.
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with no prior medical history, who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with extensive LV systolic dysfunction and apical akinesis. She had thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, but appear to be large MI. She is on milrinone to increase urine output, but her cardiac output remains unchanged.

The patient's renal function is also concerning, with decreased urine output and a relative stable creatinine level. She has been given multiple fluid boluses and is on IV milrinone, but her urine output has continued to decline.

The patient's abdominal pain is likely secondary to her cardiac condition, and her back pain is likely due to hemolysis from the balloon pump. Her lactates have been normal, and her hematocrit has trended down slightly.

The patient's anxiety is being managed with reassurance and morphine, and she is being considered for social work support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output is decreased, and she is not perfusing her kidneys well. This can lead to further decline in urine output and worsening of her cardiac condition.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's decreased urine output and relative stable creatinine level suggest that she may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased cardiac output and respiratory support may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's decreased urine output and possible sepsis may lead to septic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's decreased cardiac output and possible gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to bleeding complications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, cardiac enzymes, and renal function closely to prevent these complications from arising."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male with no prior medical history (PMH) who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and total thrombotic occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries. He underwent stenting and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

The patient has been diuresed with 40mg IV lasix twice, resulting in a total output of approximately 1000cc each time. His blood pressure is still borderline, and low-dose metoprolol was ordered but not given.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Heart rate: 96 bpm (95-126 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 97/52 mmHg (63 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows:

* Central venous pressure (CVP): 9 mmHg
* Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 48/23 mmHg
* Cardiac output (CO): 4.2 L/min
* Cardiac index (CI): 2.6 L/min/m2
* Mixed venous oxygen saturation: 58-62%

The patient has received various medications, including heparin, furosemide, and morphine. His lab results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.7-14.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 33.6-35%
* Platelet count (Plt): 261-286 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 14.92-6.78 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.6 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Thin, no acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right and left digital pulses present
* Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: No edema
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3, non-focal

The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 94%. His ABG results show:

* pH: 7.46
* PaCO2: 32 mmHg
* PaO2: 58 mmHg
* HCO3: 26 mmol/L
* Base excess: -0.2 mmol/L

Based on this information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to borderline blood pressure and borderline heart rate.
2. Respiratory compromise due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to potential infection or inadequate antibiotic coverage.
4. Renal failure due to inadequate perfusion and potential hypovolemia.
5. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy and potential platelet dysfunction.
6. Infection or sepsis due to potential catheter-related infections.
7. Cardiac tamponade or pericardial effusion due to potential cardiac injury.
8. Neurological complications due to potential hypoperfusion or hypoxia.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with no prior medical history (PMH) who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 94%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 48/23 mmHg, and cardiac output (CO) of 4.2 L/min.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating myocardial infarction. Her creatinine levels are stable, but her urine output has decreased, and she is requiring 5L NC oxygen therapy.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is not perfusing her kidneys well, and her urine output has decreased despite milrinone and fluid boluses. She may require central access and additional pressors.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but her urine output has decreased. She may require IV fluids and diuretics.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient continues to complain of vague abdominal symptoms, and a CTAP did not reveal any clear signs of pathology.
4. Back pain: The patient's hematocrit has trended down slightly, and she may have hemolysis from the balloon pump.
5. Anxiety: The patient needs reassurance and may require anxiolytics such as ativan.

The patient's plan includes continuing aspirin, plavix, and high-dose statin, holding beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, and discontinuing IABP and integrilin. She will require long-term anticoagulation due to apical akinesis, and her blood pressure will need to be closely monitored."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was
   placed to maintain pump support. CE trending down although appears to
   be large MI. Put on milrinone in attempt to increase urine output.
   Blood pressures stable without IABP and IABP removed without problem.
   Yesterday had elevated LA filling pressures so was diuresed. Yesterday
   had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol. Overnight
   restarted on milrinone for low UOP. Went into AFib and then d/c'ed
   again. Now in NSR.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox for apical akinesis
   - hold beta blocker for now - appears to need inotropic function
   - consider low dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
   - continue tele
   - PT consult
   - even I/O, monitor PA cath numbers
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. Attempted milrinone
   last night as well as fluid bolus without increase in UOP. Cardiac
   index currently 2.2.
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   - trend CO/CI
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had foley replaced. Multiple IVF
   boluses and milrinone drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into AFib
   and milrinone stopped. Her creatinine is stable.
   - trend creatinine
   - consider pressor support
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting factor.
   Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR. Was not continued.
   - hold amio
   - follow tele
   #. Leukocytosis: Prior CXR without evidence of consolidation.
   - trend WBC/temp
   - check UA
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.
   - trend hct
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse if ischemic or HD unstable
    #. Anxiety: Need reassurance often. Has responded to morphine in the
   past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD
   and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting
   with extensive LV systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP
   removed.
   24 Hour Events:
   - transition to lovenox (1mg/kg) from heparin gtt
   - cardiac output low, urine output low; DCed lasix gtt and started
   milrinone gtt again
   - went into afib w milrinone w RVR 150s, so milrinone stopped,
   amiodarone bolus; started 250cc bolus, and pt converted to NSR, likely
   from amio; PA diastolic pressure 20, CVP 10 - felt like she needed
   those filling pressures for cardiac output ; did not continue IV amio
   infusion after bolus b/c she had already converted, and the milrinone

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of no significant medical conditions who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and is currently in the ICU with extensive LV systolic dysfunction and apical akinesis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 85/48 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 95%. Her cardiac output is low, and she has been experiencing decreased urine output, which has been treated with IV fluids and milrinone.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is not perfusing her kidneys well, and her cardiac index is currently 2.2.
2. Decreased urine output: The patient's urine output has decreased despite treatment with IV fluids and milrinone.
3. AFib: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation, which was treated with a bolus of amiodarone and converted to normal sinus rhythm.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has a white blood cell count of 14.5, which is slightly elevated.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing vague abdominal symptoms, which have been evaluated with a CTAP and found to be normal.
6. Back pain: The patient is experiencing back pain, which is likely secondary to hemolysis from the balloon pump.
7. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety and has responded to morphine in the past.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 35%
* White blood cell count: 14.5
* Platelet count: 286
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 6.78
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue aspirin and Plavix
* Continue high-dose statin
* Continue Lovenox for apical akinesis
* Hold beta blocker for now and consider low-dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
* Continue tele and monitor PA cath numbers
* Monitor urine output and blood pressures
* Trend CO/CI
* Consider pressor support
* Trend creatinine
* Check UA and guaiac stools
* Transfuse if ischemic or HD unstable
* Social work for anxiety

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed.
   #. s/p STEMI: The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic
   occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was
   placed to maintain pump support. CE trending down although appears to
   be large MI. Put on milrinone in attempt to increase urine output.
   Blood pressures stable without IABP and IABP removed without problem.
   Yesterday had elevated LA filling pressures so was diuresed. Yesterday
   had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol. Overnight
   restarted on milrinone for low UOP. Went into AFib and then d/c'ed
   again. Now in NSR.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox for apical akinesis
 start coumadin
   - hold beta blocker for now - appears to need inotropic function
   - consider low dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
   - continue tele
   - PT consult
   - even I/O, monitor PA cath numbers
 d/c PA cath today if stable
   - d/c cordis if stable
   #. Cardiogenic Shock: Not perfusing kidneys well. Attempted milrinone
   last night as well as fluid bolus without increase in UOP. Cardiac
   index currently 2.2.
   - monitor urine output - IVF prn if tolerates
   - monitor blood pressures
   - trend CO/CI
   - per above
   #. Decreased urine output: The patient had foley replaced. Multiple IVF
   boluses and milrinone drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into AFib
   and milrinone stopped. Her creatinine is stable.
   - trend creatinine
   - consider pressor support
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting factor.
   Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR. Was not continued.
   - hold amio
   - follow tele
   #. Leukocytosis: Prior CXR without evidence of consolidation.
   - trend WBC/temp
   - check UA
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.
   - trend hct
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse if ischemic or HD unstable
    #. Anxiety: Need reassurance often. Has responded to morphine in the
   past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD
   and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting
   with extensive LV systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP
   removed.
   24 Hour Events:
   - transition to lovenox (1mg/kg) from heparin gtt
   - cardiac output low, urine output low; DCed lasix gtt and started
   milrinone gtt again
   - went into afib w milrinone w RVR 150s, so milrinone stopped,
   amiodarone bolus; started 250cc bolus, and pt converted to NSR, likely
   from amio; PA diastolic pressure 20, CVP 10 - felt like she needed
   those filling pressures for cardiac output ; did not continue IV amio
   infusion after bolus b/c she had already converted, and the milrinone
   likely is what caused the afib

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with no prior medical history who presented with chest pain and was found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting and has extensive LV systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis. She is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock, decreased urine output, and atrial fibrillation. She has been treated with milrinone, lasix, and amiodarone, and has had a cardiac output of 3.5 L/min and a cardiac index of 2.2 L/min/m2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiac index is currently 2.2 L/min/m2, which is below normal. This could lead to further deterioration in her cardiac function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output has been low, which could lead to acute kidney injury or failure. This could further complicate her care and increase her risk of mortality.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to further cardiac complications, such as decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
5. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be a sign of an underlying abdominal process, such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis.
6. Back Pain: The patient's back pain could be a sign of an underlying spinal process, such as a herniated disk or spinal stenosis.
7. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety could be a sign of underlying psychological distress or a side effect of her medications.
8. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability could lead to further complications, such as hypotension or hypertension, which could further complicate her care.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust her treatment as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
3. Consider starting the patient on a beta blocker to help control her heart rate and blood pressure.
4. Consider starting the patient on an anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce her inflammation.
5. Consider starting the patient on an antibiotic to help treat any underlying infection.
6. Consider starting the patient on a pain medication to help manage her abdominal and back pain.
7. Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist to help manage her anxiety.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and adjust her treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed.
   #. s/p STEMI:
   The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic occlusion of the
   proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was placed to maintain
   pump support.  Had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol.
   Had gone into Afib w milrinone two nights ago, so it was stopped.  Seen
   by PT.  Needs anticoagulation because of akinesis/hypokinesis.  Poor
   inotropy and forward cardiac flow. Urine output low, not perfusing
   kidneys well.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox for apical akinesis

   #. Decreased urine output:
   The patient had foley replaced. Multiple IVF boluses and milrinone
   drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into AFib and milrinone stopped.
   Her creatinine is stable.  Needs improved cardiac output to improve
   urine output, but options are limited to increase cardiac output.
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting factor.
    Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR.  IV loading dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed.
   #. s/p STEMI:
   The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic occlusion of the
   proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was placed to maintain
   pump support. CE trending down although appears to be large MI.
   Initially placed on milrinone in attempt to increase forward flow and
   urine output. Blood pressures stable without IABP and IABP removed
   without problem. Had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol.
   Had gone into Afib w milrinone two nights ago, so it was stopped.  Seen
   by PT.  Needs anticoagulation because of akinesis/hypokinesis.  Poor
   inotropy and forward cardiac flow. Urine output low, not perfusing
   kidneys well.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox for apical akinesis
 start coumadin
   - hold beta blocker for now - appears to need inotropic function
   - consider low dose lisinopril to decrease afterload
   - continue tele
   - PT consult
   #. Decreased urine output:
   The patient had foley replaced. Multiple IVF boluses and milrinone
   drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into AFib and milrinone stopped.
   Her creatinine is stable.
   - trend creatinine
   - consider pressor support
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting factor.
   Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR. Was not continued.
   - hold amio
   - follow tele
   #. Leukocytosis: Prior CXR without evidence of consolidation.
   - trend WBC/temp
   - check UA
   #. Abdominal pain: CTAP done without clear signs of pathology which
   could explain symptoms. The patient continues to complain of vague
   symptoms. Lactates have been normal.
   #. Back pain: Hematocrit was stable and now has trended down slightly.
   No evidence of RP or dissection on CT. Likely secondary to hemolysis
   from balloon pump.
   - trend hct
   - guaiac stools
   - transfuse if ischemic or HD unstable
    #. Anxiety: Need reassurance often. Has responded to morphine in the
   past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of 3V coronary artery disease, proximal LAD, and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, who underwent stenting with extensive left ventricular systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis. She has been admitted to the ICU with chest pain, and her condition has been complicated by various issues, including:

* Decreased urine output, which has been managed with IVF boluses and milrinone drip
* Atrial fibrillation (AFib), which has been treated with amiodarone and converted to normal sinus rhythm
* Leukocytosis, which has been monitored with serial complete blood counts (CBCs)
* Abdominal pain, which has been evaluated with a CT abdomen/pelvis (CTAP) without clear signs of pathology
* Back pain, which has been attributed to hemolysis from the balloon pump
* Anxiety, which has been managed with reassurance and morphine as needed

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
* Heart rate: 110 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 32.0%
* White blood cell count: 14.5 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 286 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 6.78 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Continued LV systolic dysfunction and apical akinesis
	+ Potential for further cardiac events, such as ventricular arrhythmias or heart failure
* Renal complications:
	+ Decreased urine output and potential for acute kidney injury (AKI)
	+ Need for continued IVF and possible pressor support
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Potential for respiratory failure due to decreased lung function and increased oxygen requirements
	+ Need for continued oxygen therapy and possible mechanical ventilation
* Hematological complications:
	+ Leukocytosis and potential for leukopenia or leukostasis
	+ Need for continued monitoring of CBCs and potential for transfusions
* Neurological complications:
	+ Potential for cognitive impairment and decreased consciousness due to decreased perfusion and oxygenation
	+ Need for continued monitoring of neurological status and potential for interventions such as hypertonic saline or mannitol

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is recommended to continue anticoagulation therapy with lovenox and warfarin, as well as aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient should also be continued on high-dose statin therapy and low-dose lisinopril to decrease afterload. The patient's creatinine should be trended and monitored for signs of AKI. The patient's anxiety should be managed with reassurance and morphine as needed. The patient's social worker should be notified to provide support and counseling."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed. Now
   DNR/DNI. Home with [**Hospital **] hospice.
   # Goals of Care: Now DNR/DNI. Moving towards hospice. Going home today
   with expectation that this may get worse. Family and patient aware of
   prognosis.
   - appreciate palliative care recs
   - appreciate case management help
   - home w VNA bridge to hospice today
   - d/c with morphine for pain and air hunger
   #. s/p STEMI:
   The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic occlusion of the
   proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was placed to maintain
   pump support.  Had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol.
   Had gone into Afib w milrinone two nights ago, so it was stopped.  Seen
   by PT.  Needs anticoagulation because of akinesis/hypokinesis.  Poor
   inotropy and forward cardiac flow. Urine output low, not perfusing
   kidneys well. Planning on going home with hospice care although DNR/DNI
   at this point.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox and coumadin for apical akinesis
   - to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9940**]
   - hold beta blocker
   - hold ACEi
   - cont low dose digoxin
   - PT consulted
   - home with VNA - consider transition to hospice
   - contact PCP
 about INR checks
    #. Decreased urine output: The patient had foley replaced. Multiple
   IVF boluses and milrinone drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into
   AFib and milrinone stopped. Her creatinine is stable.  Needs improved
   cardiac output to improve urine output, but options are limited to
   increase cardiac output.
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting
   factor.  Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR.  IV loading
   dose amio was not continued.
   - follow tele while inpatient
   #. Leukocytosis: Prior CXR without evidence of consolidation.  Appears
   to have been post-MI related.
    #. Anxiety: Needs reassurance often. Has responded to morphine in the
   past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old female, is a post-STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) with 3V CAD (coronary artery disease) and proximal LAD (left anterior descending) and LCx (circumflex) total thrombotic occlusion. She underwent stenting with LV (left ventricular) systolic dysfunction, including apical akinesis. IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) was removed, and she is now DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate). The patient is experiencing chest pain, anxiety, and air hunger, and is being managed with morphine and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Worsening heart failure due to apical akinesis and decreased cardiac output.
	* Increased risk of arrhythmias, including AFib (atrial fibrillation).
	* Decreased urine output due to decreased cardiac output and potential kidney hypoperfusion.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or atelectasis in the left lower lobe, as suggested by CXR (chest X-ray).
	* Respiratory failure due to decreased cardiac output and potential respiratory muscle weakness.
3. Hemodynamic instability:
	* Decreased blood pressure due to decreased cardiac output and potential vasodilation.
	* Increased risk of hypotension and shock.
4. Infection:
	* Potential bacteremia or sepsis due to decreased immune function and potential IV (intravenous) line infections.
5. Neurological complications:
	* Increased risk of stroke or transient ischemic attacks due to decreased cardiac output and potential embolization.
6. Pain and discomfort:
	* Chest pain due to cardiac ischemia or infarction.
	* Air hunger due to respiratory failure or cardiac instability.
7. Psychological complications:
	* Anxiety and depression due to decreased quality of life and potential end-of-life situation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose statin to manage cardiac disease.
2. Continue lovenox and coumadin for apical akinesis and potential thrombotic events.
3. Hold beta blocker and ACEi (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) due to decreased cardiac output.
4. Continue low-dose digoxin for cardiac arrhythmia management.
5. Monitor urine output and cardiac output closely, and consider IV fluids and milrinone drip to improve cardiac function.
6. Continue morphine for pain and air hunger management.
7. Consider transition to hospice care, and involve social work and palliative care services to manage patient and family needs.
8. Monitor for signs of infection, and consider antibiotics if necessary.
9. Monitor for signs of neurological complications, and consider neurology consultation if necessary.
10. Provide psychological support and counseling to patient and family."

   Assessment and Plan
   87F with no PMHx p/w chest pain found to have 3V CAD and proximal LAD
   and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, now s/p stenting with extensive LV
   systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis.  IABP removed. Now
   DNR/DNI. Home with [**Hospital **] hospice.
   # Goals of Care: Now DNR/DNI. Moving towards hospice. Going home today
   with expectation that this may get worse. Family and patient aware of
   prognosis.
   - appreciate palliative care recs
   - appreciate case management help
   - home w VNA bridge to hospice today
   #. s/p STEMI:
   The patient has diffuse disease. She had thrombotic occlusion of the
   proximal LAD and LCx requiring 5 stents. IABP was placed to maintain
   pump support.  Had increased SVR and decreased CO after metoprolol.
   Had gone into Afib w milrinone two nights ago, so it was stopped.  Seen
   by PT.  Needs anticoagulation because of akinesis/hypokinesis.  Poor
   inotropy and forward cardiac flow. Urine output low, not perfusing
   kidneys well. Planning on going home with hospice care although DNR/DNI
   at this point.
   - continue aspirin, plavix
   - continue high dose statin
   - continue lovenox and coumadin for apical akinesis
   - to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9940**]
   - hold beta blocker
   - hold ACEi
   - cont low dose digoxin
   - PT consulted
   - home with VNA - consider transition to hospice
    #. Decreased urine output: The patient had foley replaced. Multiple
   IVF boluses and milrinone drip. UOP still dropped. Patient went into
   AFib and milrinone stopped. Her creatinine is stable.  Needs improved
   cardiac output to improve urine output, but options are limited to
   increase cardiac output.
   #. AFib RVR: To 150s. D/ced milrinone which was likely inciting
   factor.  Also given bolus of amio which converted into NSR.  IV loading
   dose amio was not continued.
   - follow tele while inpatient
   #. Leukocytosis: Prior CXR without evidence of consolidation.  Appears
   to have been post-MI related.
    #. Anxiety: Needs reassurance often. Has responded to morphine in the
   past.
   - Social work
   - consider low dose ativan for outpatient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of 3V CAD and proximal LAD and LCx total thrombotic occlusion, who underwent stenting with LV systolic dysfunction including apical akinesis. She was admitted to the ICU with chest pain and was found to have a total thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD and LCx, requiring 5 stents. The patient's condition has worsened, and she is now DNR/DNI. She is being discharged home with hospice care and is expected to deteriorate further.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening cardiac function: The patient's LV systolic dysfunction and apical akinesis may worsen, leading to further decreased cardiac output and urine output.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's moderate bibasilar atelectases and pleural effusions may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's new left lower lobe opacity may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia, which could progress and lead to sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with coumadin and lovenox may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with her decreased platelet count.
5. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and decreased perfusion of the kidneys may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may worsen with the expectation of further deterioration, leading to increased distress and potential complications.
7. DVT: The patient's LMW heparin prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent DVT, particularly with her decreased mobility and immobility.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be adequate to prevent stress ulcers, particularly with her increased risk of bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with coumadin and lovenox to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely, including echocardiograms and troponin levels, to assess for worsening cardiac function.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, including oxygen saturation and ABG levels, to assess for worsening respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine levels closely to assess for worsening kidney function.
5. Consider increasing the patient's dose of morphine to manage her anxiety and pain.
6. Consider transitioning the patient to hospice care as soon as possible to provide support and comfort care.
7. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely to assess for bleeding risk and adjust anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
8. Consider adding stress ulcer prophylaxis, such as pantoprazole, to prevent stress ulcers."
