   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with history of bipolar d/o and now found outside of home
   with unresponsive state.  Patient to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation where son
   noted patient was well the day prior.  At [**Hospital1 **] patient with
   hyperglycemia and negative CT/LP and patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care
   following 1g of Dilantin.  She has remained with persistent altered
   mental status and to this point remains unresponsive.  Vanco/Zosyn/CTX
   was given and patient admitted to ICU for further care.
   1) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/COMA
She has impaired and persistent coma
   noted at this time.  This raises concern for diffuse cortical insult
   which has not been seen with tox screen, LP, look for systemic
   infection which have not been revealing.  This would leave possible
   pontine level infarct as driver of insult with non-convulsive status
   being second most likely insult.
   -MRI this morning
   -EEG this morning
   -Will move to treatment for seizures  based on EEG findings and
   clinical response but would like to defer on treatment for seizures
   until EEG completed.
   2) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)-_This may be hypovolemic but perhaps
   vasodilatory in the setting of severe neurologic insult consistent with
   neurogenic shock is most likely.
   -Levophed as needed
   -Fluid bolus as needed
   -Empiric antibiotics reasonable
   3)Aspiraiton
patient at risk for aspiration event with altered mental
   status and will have to continue to suction frequently and maintain
   adequate airway protection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female who was found unresponsive outside her home and was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of coma. She has a history of bipolar disorder and was previously well, but her son noted that she was unwell the day prior to admission.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.1°F, blood pressure of 93/30 mmHg, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. She is receiving infusions of norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and vancomycin.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft abdomen, diminished breath sounds, and diminished reflexes bilaterally. She has decorticate posture on examination with painful stimuli in the upper torso, and her pupils are equal and reactive to light.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, platelet count of 179 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Her troponin-T is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and her lactate acid is 1.5 mmol/L. Her imaging studies, including a CT head and chest X-ray, are normal.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Altered mental status/coma: The patient's persistent coma raises concern for a diffuse cortical insult, which has not been seen with tox screen, LP, or systemic infection. The patient will undergo MRI and EEG to further evaluate the cause of her altered mental status.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be hypovolemic or vasodilatory, and she will receive levophed as needed and fluid boluses as needed. Empiric antibiotics are also reasonable.
3. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to her altered mental status and will require frequent suctioning and airway protection.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: NPO
* Glycemic control: Tight glycemic control is important for patients with altered mental status and hyperglycemia.
* Lines: The patient's multi-lumen line will need to be changed, and she will receive 18-gauge lines for further care.
* Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Code status: The patient's code status is full code until clarified.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not treated promptly.
* Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration due to her altered mental status and altered airway reflexes can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Neurologic deterioration: The patient's persistent coma and decorticate posture may indicate ongoing neurologic deterioration, which can lead to permanent brain damage or death if not treated promptly.
* Infection: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may indicate infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure if not treated promptly.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia and altered mental status may indicate hypoglycemia, which can lead to permanent brain damage or death if not treated promptly."

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics for now
   .
   #.  Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status improves
   -          Consider either stopping antibiotics if CXR clear, or
   broadening spectrum to cover anaerobes (given aspiration event) &/or
   pseudomonas if she deteriorates.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold lisinopril
   .
   #.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - hold actos, glyburide, metformin
   .
   5.  Bipolar disorder.  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder, on
   disability.  Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
   - hold lexapro
   .
   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.
   - trend LFTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics
   .
   #. Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold lisinopril
   .
   3.  Elevated lactate.  Elevated lactate raises the possibility of an
   infection infectious workup is negative thus far.  Also, could be
   secondary to seizure activity.
   - trend lactate
   - IVFs boluses prn
   - empiric antibiotics with ceftriaxone/vanco pending culture data
   .
   4.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - hold actos, glyburide, metformin
   .
   5.  Bipolar disorder.  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder, on
   disability.  Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
   - hold lexapro
   .
   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   7.  Hyperlipidemia.
   - hold simvastatin given elevated LFTs and inability to take POs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 62-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and a recent diagnosis of Hepatitis C.
* She was admitted with altered mental status, which is still unclear in etiology, and is currently intubated for airway protection.
* She has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for further respiratory complications.
* She is also at risk for sepsis, hypotension, and hyperglycemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Seizure Activity:** The patient's EEG is pending, and she has been started on dilantin for possible intermittent seizures. If seizure activity is confirmed, it may lead to further neurological complications.
2. **Aspiration Pneumonia:** The patient's aspiration event yesterday may have led to a right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural effusion, which may worsen if not properly managed.
3. **Sepsis:** The patient's elevated lactate levels and positive Hepatitis C status increase her risk for sepsis, which may lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemic or septic causes, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, if not properly managed.
6. **Hepatitis C:** The patient's recent diagnosis of Hepatitis C may lead to further complications, such as cirrhosis, if not properly managed.
7. **Bipolar Disorder:** The patient's history of bipolar disorder and multiple prior overdoses with medications may lead to further psychiatric complications if not properly managed.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Optimize respiratory care to prevent further aspiration pneumonia and respiratory complications.
3. Continue to evaluate and manage the patient's hypotension, hyperglycemia, and Hepatitis C.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further psychiatric complications.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's liver function tests to monitor for potential complications of Hepatitis C."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with admission with COMA.  She has a history of substance
   abuse but no ingestion suspected, reported or found.  She does have
   bipolar diagnosis but no evidence of recent trauma or worsening of
   underlying mental health disease.  No recent prodrome of infection, no
   fever and no evidence of meningitis.  We have concern for possible
   seizure--with non-convulsive status or dense post ictal state driving
   exam.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Differential above
she has improved through to
   this morning
   -Dilantin load in place
   -EEG for 24 hours today.
   -Will move towards extubation today to faciliate better examination
   going forward.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -This was secondary to altered mental status and aspiration event with
   hypoxemia.  Much of the infiltrate was resolved in the setting of
   intubation but with some persistence
   -We have minimal secretions at this time
   -Will continue antibiotics that were started in the setting of concern
   for meningitis as we are now treating pneumonia
   -Move to SBT today and extubation with patient able to respond to
   commands
   3) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed to look to wean to off today and have minimal dose
   -Will continue with wean
   -[**Month (only) 8**] see improvement with resolution of active pneumonitis and will
   continue with antibiotics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with admission with COMA.  She has a history of substance
   abuse but no ingestion suspected, reported or found.  She does have
   bipolar diagnosis but no evidence of recent trauma or worsening of
   underlying mental health disease.  No recent prodrome of infection, no
   fever and no evidence of meningitis.  We have concern for possible
   seizure--with non-convulsive status or dense post ictal state driving
   exam.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Differential above
she has improved through to
   this morning
   -Dilantin load in place
   -EEG for 24 hours today.
   -Will move towards extubation today to faciliate better examination
   going forward.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -This was secondary to altered mental status and aspiration event with
   hypoxemia.  Much of the infiltrate was resolved in the setting of
   intubation but with some persistence
   -We have minimal secretions at this time
   -Will continue antibiotics that were started in the setting of concern
   for meningitis as we are now treating pneumonia
   -Move to SBT today and extubation with patient able to respond to
   commands
   3) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed to look to wean to off today and have minimal dose
   -Will continue with wean
   -[**Month (only) 8**] see improvement with resolution of active pneumonitis and will
   continue with antibiotics

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of coma, respiratory failure, and aspiration. The patient has a history of substance abuse and bipolar disorder, but no recent ingestion or trauma is suspected.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/54 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's neurological examination reveals a response to voice commands, but she does not respond to painful stimuli. She has isolated clonus of the right lower extremity and bilateral brisk reflexes at the patellar tendon.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels, but normal liver function tests. The patient's troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and her lactate level is 1.8 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies, including a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and a chest X-ray, are normal. The patient's EEG is ongoing.

The patient's medical plan includes continued antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia, weaning off levophed, and moving towards extubation with improvement in her neurological status. The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and venous thromboembolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and aspiration event put her at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status and isolated clonus of the right lower extremity suggest a possible seizure disorder.
3. Meningitis: The patient's history of substance abuse and altered mental status increase her risk for developing meningitis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, despite receiving levophed, puts her at risk for developing shock.
5. Worsening of underlying mental health disease: The patient's bipolar disorder may worsen during her hospitalization, requiring closer monitoring and management.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged hospitalization increase her risk for developing nutritional deficiencies.
7. Skin breakdown: The patient's immobility and potential for prolonged hospitalization increase her risk for developing skin breakdown."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and hepatitis C, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient's initial presentation was unresponsive, but she has since become verbal and communicative. The patient has a supratherapeutic Lamictal level, and the likely etiology of her altered mental status is Lamictal ingestion. The patient is undergoing 24-hour EEG with Dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. She has been extubated and is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intermittent Seizures: The patient's supratherapeutic Lamictal level and history of bipolar disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts make her prone to seizures. The ongoing EEG and Dilantin load may help manage this risk.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and recent respiratory support with a nasal cannula may increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's positive Hepatitis C status and recent antibiotic use may increase her risk of infection, particularly with multidrug-resistant organisms.
4. Hypotension: The patient's recent episode of hypotension may be a sign of underlying cardiovascular instability, and close monitoring of her blood pressure is necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and recent hyperglycemia may increase her risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS).
6. Liver Disease: The patient's positive Hepatitis C status and elevated liver enzymes may indicate underlying liver disease, which could lead to complications such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or liver failure.
7. Mental Health Complications: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and multiple prior suicide attempts make her prone to mental health complications, such as depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation. Close monitoring of her mental health and consideration of psychiatric consultation are necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications to ensure her safety and well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient was admitted to the ICU unresponsive and remained in this state until verbal and communicative this afternoon. The patient was extubated and is currently receiving nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support has been discontinued, and they are currently receiving standby ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show normal ranges for most values, with the exception of a slightly elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent extubation and discontinuation of invasive ventilation may put them at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway may indicate a risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and decreased blood pressure may indicate a risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction.
4. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA screen and blood cultures pending may indicate a risk for infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, which may indicate a risk for fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent removal of nasogastric tubes and decreased bowel sounds may indicate a risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or ileus.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's recent placement of a central line and use of SQ UF Heparin for DVT prophylaxis may indicate a risk for VTE.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or treat any adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and hepatitis C, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. She had an aspiration event, was intubated, and received antibiotics. Her condition has improved, and she is now extubated. She has been experiencing hypotension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, which are being managed with IV fluids, insulin, and statins. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is now communicative. She has a history of multiple suicide attempts and is being closely monitored for any signs of deterioration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had an aspiration event and was intubated, but now that she is extubated, there is a risk of respiratory failure if she experiences another aspiration event or develops pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient had an aspiration event, which increases the risk of sepsis. The patient's hypotension and hyperglycemia may also be indicative of sepsis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin for hyperglycemia, but there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dose is not adjusted properly.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has hepatitis C and elevated LFTs, which may indicate hepatic dysfunction. The patient's INR is normal, but the patient's liver function should be closely monitored.
5. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for DVT/PE due to immobility and the presence of central lines.
6. Medication overdose: The patient has a history of suicide attempts and is taking multiple medications. There is a risk of medication overdose if the patient's medications are not properly monitored.
7. Infection: The patient has an indwelling urinary catheter and is at risk for urinary tract infections. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of bloodstream infections if the patient develops a secondary infection.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but there are several potential medical complications that need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent deterioration."

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH):  Good sats on 2 L nasal cannula.  CXR
   improved in right base raising the question of aspiration pneumonitis
   given rapid clearing, ?blunting left CPA.  Will repeat CXR.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Unclear etiology.  EEG being
   done to evaluate for seizure.  On dilantin.  Given history of bipolar
   disorder and prior history of suicide attempts, will also consult
   psychiatry.  Stable for transfer to the floor albeit will need a sitter
   per nursing.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Unclear etiology, empirically covered with
   levophed, vanco/ceftriaxone, off pressors since yesterday morning.  No
   new culture data.  Check UA.  If outside hosptial culutres also
   negative would discontinue antibiotics.
 HYPOKALEMIA:  Repleted.  Following serial lytes.  Also will give Mg.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Calculate free water deficit.  Appears euvolemic on
   exam, will replace free water and follow electrolytes.
 DM:  On insulin sliding scale.
   Else agree with detailed assessment and plan as per medical ICU
   resident's note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   improved in right base raising the question of aspiration pneumonitis
   given rapid clearing, ?blunting left CPA.  Will repeat CXR.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Unclear etiology.  EEG being
   done to evaluate for seizure.  On dilantin.  Given history of bipolar
   disorder and prior history of suicide attempts, will also consult
   psychiatry.  Stable for transfer to the floor albeit will need a sitter
   per nursing.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Unclear etiology, empirically covered with
   levophed, vanco/ceftriaxone, off pressors since yesterday morning.  No
   new culture data.  Check UA.  If outside hosptial culutres also
   negative would discontinue antibiotics.
 HYPOKALEMIA:  Repleted.  Following serial lytes.  Also will give Mg.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Calculate free water deficit.  Appears euvolemic on
   exam, will replace free water and follow electrolytes.
 DM:  On insulin sliding scale.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of coma and respiratory failure. The patient was extubated and continues to be off pressors. The patient's condition has improved, with more awakening and ability to follow simple commands.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect their airway and potential aspiration of gastric contents can lead to pneumonia.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's altered mental status and unclear etiology of their condition increase the risk of seizure activity, which is being evaluated with an EEG.
3. Hypotension: The patient's unclear etiology of hypotension and empiric coverage with levophed, vanco/ceftriaxone increase the risk of continued hypotension and potential cardiovascular complications.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's repletion of potassium levels and serial monitoring of electrolytes are necessary to prevent further hypokalemia and potential cardiac complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia requires calculation of free water deficit and replacement of free water to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and unclear etiology of their condition increase the risk of delirium, which can be exacerbated by the patient's history of bipolar disorder and prior suicide attempts.
7. Infection: The patient's empiric coverage with antibiotics and negative culture data do not rule out the possibility of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's unclear etiology of hypotension and empiric coverage with levophed increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires continued monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and medical therapy. The patient's airway, breathing, and circulation must be closely monitored to prevent aspiration pneumonia and hypotension. The patient's mental status must be closely monitored to prevent delirium and seizure activity. The patient's electrolyte levels must be closely monitored to prevent further imbalances. The patient's infection risk must be closely monitored to prevent sepsis and organ dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and multiple prior suicide attempts, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. Her lamictal level is supratherapeutic, and she has ingested an unknown number of pills. She is agitated and requires 1:1 sitter and haloperidol for agitation. Her respiratory status is stable, and her labs show mild hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin. She has a history of hepatitis C, but her liver function tests are stable, and she has no evidence of cirrhosis. She has a recent diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and is on simvastatin, which will be held due to elevated LFTs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Lamictal toxicity: The patient's supratherapeutic lamictal level may lead to serious complications, including seizures, coma, and death.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia may increase her risk of developing hypotension, which can be life-threatening.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's mild hyperglycemia may lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or even death if not managed properly.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient's recent diagnosis of hepatitis C may lead to complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure, or even liver cancer if not managed properly.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
7. Infection: The patient's history of multiple prior suicide attempts and her current altered mental status may increase her risk of developing infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's lamictal level and adjust her treatment accordingly.
2. Maintain close observation of the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin and monitor her glucose levels closely.
4. Trend the patient's liver function tests to monitor her hepatitis C and adjust her treatment accordingly.
5. Provide close monitoring of the patient's mental status and agitation, and provide haloperidol as needed.
6. Consider consulting with a psychiatrist to develop a plan for the patient's mental health and suicide prevention.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to develop a plan for the patient's hepatitis C treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to lamictal toxicity after taking 104 pills. She was initially agitated and required haloperidol for sedation. Her EEG was negative, and dilantin was discontinued. Her hypernatremia was resolved with D5W. Antibiotics were stopped due to negative culture data. Her CXR showed improvement. She has been receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, dilantin, haloperidol, and heparin sodium.

Current Vital Signs:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart Rate: 66 beats per minute
* Blood Pressure: 108/42 mmHg
* Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Weight: 63.3 kg

Lab Results:

* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* Platelet Count: 124 K/uL
* White Blood Cell Count: 12.2 K/uL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen: 28 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic Acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.7 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Lamictal toxicity: The patient's lamictal level is 35, which is above the upper limit of normal. This may lead to ongoing toxicity and potential seizure activity.
2. Hypernatremia: Although resolved, the patient's hypernatremia may lead to long-term sequelae, such as cognitive impairment or seizures.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be a sign of underlying neurological damage or ongoing toxicity. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's negative culture data do not rule out the possibility of infection. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to prevent sepsis.
5. Bloodstream infection: The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, and there is a risk of bloodstream infection.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 100%, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying condition.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is <0.01 ng/mL, but she may be at risk for cardiac complications due to her underlying condition.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address her ongoing medical issues."

   ICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU residents, the
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would add
   and emphasize the following.
   Patient more alert this am, pleasant.  Didn
t recall meeting us from
   yesterday, knows she is in the [**Hospital1 5**].  Denies pain, SOB.
   Lungs CTA Abdomen soft, good BS No edema
   As above, etiology of here unresponsiveness likely secondary to
   lamictal overdose.  Appreciate input from neurology and psychiatry
   services.  Preliminary read on EEG is not seizure activity, will
   confirm with neuro and discontinue dilantin.  Agree with sitter
   awaiting inpatient  placement for psychiatric care.
   Time spent:  25 minutes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Given supratherapeutic lamictal level, and
   h/o suicide attempts, ingestion is most likely etiology.  MRI showed no
   infarct.  LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.
   Hepatitis C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr
   EEG with dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures.  Now waking
   up but with agitation. Getting prn haldol.  Appreciate neurology input.

   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.
   - trend LFTs

   ICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU residents, the
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would add
   and emphasize the following.
   Patient more alert this am, pleasant.  Didn
t recall meeting us from
   yesterday, knows she is in the [**Hospital1 5**].  Denies pain, SOB.
   Lungs CTA Abdomen soft, good BS No edema
   As above, etiology of here unresponsiveness likely secondary to
   lamictal overdose.  Appreciate input from neurology and psychiatry
   services.  Preliminary read on EEG is not seizure activity, will
   confirm with neuro and discontinue dilantin.  Agree with sitter
   awaiting inpatient  placement for psychiatric care.
   Time spent:  25 minutes

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and multiple prior suicide attempts. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and supratherapeutic lamictal levels.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Altered mental status: The patient is currently waking up but with agitation, and is receiving prn haldol.
* Respiratory status: The patient's lungs are clear by exam and CXR, with no leukocytosis.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia has responded to insulin, with no evidence of DKA.
* Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, and is currently being treated with haldol prn.
* Hepatitis C: The patient has a recent diagnosis of hepatitis C, with normal albumin and INR levels.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being treated with simvastatin hold due to elevated LFTs and inability to take POs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Lamictal toxicity: The patient's supratherapeutic lamictal levels may lead to continued agitation, seizures, or other neurological complications.
* Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect her airway may lead to aspiration of food or secretions, which can cause pneumonia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but may deteriorate if she develops respiratory failure or requires mechanical ventilation.
* Infection: The patient's recent diagnosis of hepatitis C and the use of antibiotics may increase the risk of infection.
* Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and the use of dilantin may increase the risk of seizures, particularly if the EEG shows abnormal activity.
* Suicide attempt: The patient's history of suicide attempts and current altered mental status may increase the risk of another suicide attempt.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her medication as needed.
* Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor her respiratory status closely.
* Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
* Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment.
* Consider referring the patient to a primary care physician for further evaluation and treatment of her underlying medical conditions.
* Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust her treatment plan as needed."
