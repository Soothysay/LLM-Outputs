You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Total CO2 (TCO2): 15 mEq/L
* Glucose: 153 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, high-grade GNR bacteremia, and presumed source pyelonephritis. The patient is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, pressors, and antibiotics. The patient's urine output is oliguric, approaching anuric, and the urine sediment is pending examination.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Renal failure and acute kidney injury
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological impairment
* Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, septicemia, and urinary tract infections
* Hemodynamic instability and cardiovascular collapse
* Nutritional deficiencies and glycemic control issues
* Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stress ulcer bleeding

Based on the patient's condition, it is crucial to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, urosepsis, and GNR bacteremia. She is currently receiving vasopressors and has a CVP of 12 mmHg. Her MAP is 121/60 mmHg, and her SpO2 is 98% on 3L of oxygen. Her physical examination is significant for somnolence, tachycardia, and bilateral crackles in the lungs. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal mild-to-moderate left hydronephrosis and echogenic material in both collecting systems, which may represent papillary necrosis, hemorrhagic clot, or noncalcified stones.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): Given the patient's oliguric state, ATN is a possibility, especially in the setting of sepsis and hypotension.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is worsening despite volume repletion, which suggests that pre-renal physiology is unlikely. Oliguria in the setting of sepsis and hypotension also increases the risk of ATN.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation studies with an INR of 1.8, which may be related to sepsis. Platelet counts are trending downward, and DIC labs are pending.
4. Myocardial Ischemia: The patient has asymptomatic troponin leak, which may be related to increased myocardial demand in the setting of septic shock.
5. Urosepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and urinary source, which may lead to further complications if not adequately treated.
6. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's bilateral crackles in the lungs may indicate pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's oliguria and electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

Recommendations:

1. Titrate pressors to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.
2. Titrate LR boluses to maintain CVP 8-10 mmHg.
3. Trend mixed venous O2 and lactate levels.
4. Administer meropenem for coverage of GNR bacteremia.
5. Consider repeat CT scan if clinically stable to further evaluate bilateral calyceal obstruction.
6. Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins if possible.
7. Monitor for signs of DIC and consider reverse with vitamin K if necessary.
8. Complete r/o MI and repeat EKG if concern for ACS.
9. Follow lytes and replete PRN with caution given diminished renal function.
10. Consider NPO status pending any intervention by urology/IR."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who was admitted with septic shock and urosepsis. The patient has a GNR bacteremia and left hydronephrosis with bilateral calyceal obstruction.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 106 bpm
* Blood pressure: 121/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98% on 3L oxygen
* Lactate level: 1.9 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Somnolent but arousable with altered mental status
* Tachycardic with normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Bilateral crackles in the lungs
* Soft abdomen with no rebound or guarding
* Cool, dry skin with no evidence of peripheral edema

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 48.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 356 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.17 ng/mL
* Lactate: 1.9 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient has been started on vasopressin and norepinephrine for septic shock, and has received meropenem for GNR bacteremia. The patient's urine output is oliguric, and the ultrasound shows bilateral calyceal obstruction by blood, pus, or noncalcified stones.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, hypotension, and oliguria.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis, hypotension, and oliguria.
3. Papillary necrosis due to bilateral calyceal obstruction by blood, pus, or noncalcified stones.
4. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction due to increased cardiac demand and potential cardiac ischemia.
5. Coagulopathy due to sepsis and decreased platelet count.
6. Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload and sepsis.
7. Infection and sepsis due to GNR bacteremia and urinary source.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Titration of vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.
* Titration of lactated Ringer's (LR) boluses to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-10 mmHg.
* Trending mixed venous oxygen saturation and lactate levels.
* Administration of meropenem for GNR bacteremia.
* Renal consult for possible papillary necrosis and relationship to the patient's underlying condition.
* Repeat CT scan if clinically stable.
* Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
* Monitoring of coagulation parameters and potential reversal with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) if necessary.
* Complete r/o myocardial infarction and repeat EKG if concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
* NPO status pending any intervention by urology or interventional radiology (IR)."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F with PMH Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent UTI admitted
   with urosepsis on two pressors.
   .
   #Urosepsis - Blood cultures from admission with high grade GNR
   bacteremia, with 4/4 bottles positive in <12 hours.  Most likely source
   is pyelonephritis given echogenic material in pelvices bilaterally and
   evidence of perinephric stranding.  Other possibility could be renal
   abscess or GI source of GNR bacteremia but less likely.  Very
   concerning that she continues to be oliguric bordering on anuric
   despite adequate CVP of [**9-16**] after getting 8L IVF since admission and
   MAP of 65 on levophed/vasopressin.  Lack of urine output concerning for
   ATN.  She has also had significant increase in WBC from 13 on admission
   to 56.5 now on repeat concerning that she could have intrarenal pus [**1-7**]
   pylonephritis which is not draining [**1-7**] oliguria.
   -renal consult
   -urology consult
   -IR consult for ?perc nephrostomy tube for drainage (not indicated at
   this time per discussion with IR resident)
   -continue meropenam given ESBL Ecoli on UCX last week
   -IVF boluses with LR or sodium bicarb as needed for CVP of [**7-15**]
   -continue with levophed and vasopressin for MAP >65
   -send urine for lytes, sediment evaluation
   -consider repeat renal u/s in morning to obtain better images, CT with
   contrast would be better however will avoid given ARF
   -send stool cultures (no mention of colitis or other concerning
   intraabd source on non-con CT at OSH)
   -CXR without evidence of PNA or pulmonary source for infection
   -serial lactates -> have been trending down from peak of 5, now 1.9
   suggesting improved end organ perfusion with above management
   .
   #Acute renal failure/Oliguria - baseline creatinine 0.8, renal
   ultrasound reportedly concerning for papillary necrosis with most
   likely cause in this case being pyelonephritis, analgesics nephropathy
   (given longterm daily percocet use) or hypotension in the setting of
   sepsis.
   -IVF to maintain CVP >8
   -titrate levophed for map >65
   -renal consult, urology consult, IR consult as above
   -send urine for sediment
   -renally dose all meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-Gap metabolic acidosis - with appropriate respiratory
   compensation, at this point worsening acidosis may be due to
   significant repletion with NS since admission as well as intrinsic
   renal dysfunction and inadequate bicarb regeneration.  She also has
   diarrhea which may be contributing.
   -IVF with sodium bicarb or LR, will avoid NS
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Coagulopathy - elevated PT/PTT with INR at 1.6 from normal baseline
   likely [**1-7**] sepsis.  No evidence of DIC at this time, with stable
   platelets of 247.
   -trend daily
   -reverse with vitamin K if continues to increase (+/- FFP if concern
   for acute bleeding)
   .
   #Demand myocardial ischemia - with isolated bump in troponin on
   admission with peak of 0.26, CK and MB flat, likely due to severe
   hypotension in setting of sepsis.  Now trending down.  She has no chest
   pain or EKG changes concerning for ACS.
   -will stop checking as troponin trending down
   -repeat EKG if concern for ACS, chest pain
   .
   #FEN - hypovolemic on admission now with adequate CVP of ~10, continue
   to bolus to maintain CVP >8, replete lytes cautiously given concern for
   worsening renal failure
   -hypocalcemia -> gave calcium gluconate
   -hypokalemia -> gave KCl
   -hypomagnesemia -> replete with mag sulfate prn
   -NPO for now until stabilized

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who was admitted with urosepsis and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 106 bpm (94-129 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 121/60 mmHg (81-148/124 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (14-32 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 12 mmHg (7-35 mmHg)

The patient has a high-grade GNR bacteremia, with cultures from admission showing 4/4 bottles positive in less than 12 hours. The most likely source of the bacteremia is pyelonephritis, given the echogenic material in the pelvices bilaterally and evidence of perinephric stranding. The patient is oliguric, bordering on anuric, despite adequate CVP and MAP.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 48.6-63.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.0-10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 218-356 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5-1.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.17-0.34 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.4-8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1-2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.8-3.1 mg/dL

The patient's condition is concerning due to the development of acute renal failure, non-gap metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and demand myocardial ischemia. The patient's CVP is currently adequate, but the patient is still oliguric, and the lack of urine output is concerning for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue meropenem for the treatment of urosepsis
* IVF boluses with LR or sodium bicarb as needed to maintain CVP >8
* Continue with levophed and vasopressin for MAP >65
* Send urine for lytes, sediment evaluation
* Consider repeat renal u/s in the morning to obtain better images
* Send stool cultures
* Continue to monitor lactates and adjust therapy as needed
* Renally dose all medications
* Avoid nephrotoxins

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo F with PMH Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent UTI admitted
   with urosepsis on two pressors.
   .
   #Urosepsis - Blood cultures from admission with high grade GNR
   bacteremia, with 4/4 bottles positive in <12 hours.  Most likely source
   is pyelonephritis given echogenic material in pelvices bilaterally and
   evidence of perinephric stranding.  Other possibility could be renal
   abscess or GI source of GNR bacteremia but less likely.  Very
   concerning that she continues to be oliguric bordering on anuric
   despite adequate CVP of [**9-16**] after getting 8L IVF since admission and
   MAP of 65 on levophed/vasopressin.  Lack of urine output concerning for
   ATN.  She has also had significant increase in WBC from 13 on admission
   to 56.5 now on repeat concerning that she could have intrarenal pus [**1-7**]
   pylonephritis which is not draining [**1-7**] oliguria.
   -renal consult
   -urology consult
   -IR consult for ?perc nephrostomy tube for drainage (not indicated at
   this time per discussion with IR resident)
   -continue meropenam given ESBL Ecoli on UCX last week
   -IVF boluses with LR or sodium bicarb as needed for CVP of [**7-15**]
   -continue with levophed and vasopressin for MAP >65
   -send urine for lytes, sediment evaluation
   -consider repeat renal u/s in morning to obtain better images, CT with
   contrast would be better however will avoid given ARF
   -send stool cultures (no mention of colitis or other concerning
   intraabd source on non-con CT at OSH)
   -CXR without evidence of PNA or pulmonary source for infection
   -serial lactates -> have been trending down from peak of 5, now 1.9
   suggesting improved end organ perfusion with above management
   .
   #Acute renal failure/Oliguria - baseline creatinine 0.8, renal
   ultrasound reportedly concerning for papillary necrosis with most
   likely cause in this case being pyelonephritis, analgesics nephropathy
   (given longterm daily percocet use) or hypotension in the setting of
   sepsis.
   -IVF to maintain CVP >8
   -titrate levophed for map >65
   -renal consult, urology consult, IR consult as above
   -send urine for sediment
   -renally dose all meds
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-Gap metabolic acidosis - with appropriate respiratory
   compensation, at this point worsening acidosis may be due to
   significant repletion with NS since admission as well as intrinsic
   renal dysfunction and inadequate bicarb regeneration.  She also has
   diarrhea which may be contributing.
   -IVF with sodium bicarb or LR, will avoid NS
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #Coagulopathy - elevated PT/PTT with INR at 1.6 from normal baseline
   likely [**1-7**] sepsis.  No evidence of DIC at this time, with stable
   platelets of 247.
   -trend daily
   -reverse with vitamin K if continues to increase (+/- FFP if concern
   for acute bleeding)
   .
   #Demand myocardial ischemia - with isolated bump in troponin on
   admission with peak of 0.26, CK and MB flat, likely due to severe
   hypotension in setting of sepsis.  Now trending down.  She has no chest
   pain or EKG changes concerning for ACS.
   -will stop checking as troponin trending down
   -repeat EKG if concern for ACS, chest pain
   .
   #FEN - hypovolemic on admission now with adequate CVP of ~10, continue
   to bolus to maintain CVP >8, replete lytes cautiously given concern for
   worsening renal failure
   -hypocalcemia -> gave calcium gluconate
   -hypokalemia -> gave KCl

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who was admitted with urosepsis and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient has a high-grade GNR bacteremia, with evidence of pyelonephritis, and is oliguric, bordering on anuric, despite adequate central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's oliguria and worsening renal function, despite adequate CVP and MAP, suggest a high risk of developing ATN.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is 0.8, and the current creatinine is 1.8, indicating a significant decline in renal function. This may lead to further deterioration in renal function and potentially require dialysis.
3. Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT/PTT and INR suggest a coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis may worsen due to ongoing repletion with normal saline, intrinsic renal dysfunction, and inadequate bicarbonate regeneration.
5. Demand Myocardial Ischemia: The patient's isolated bump in troponin on admission and peak of 0.26 suggest a possible demand myocardial ischemia, which may require further monitoring and treatment.
6. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hypovolemia on admission and subsequent fluid boluses may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate existing conditions such as renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea may worsen the patient's metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalance, and may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen and ABG values of 7.25/28/87 may indicate respiratory compromise, which may require further monitoring and treatment.

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and optimize their care."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo female with history of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia admit with
   abdominal pain and admit with renal calculi and concern for
   pyelonephritis based on CT scan at MWH.  She was transferred here with
   Sepsis (21% bands) and likely renal source.  In this setting she did
   have recent history of E. Coli (S-gent/tobra/bactrim) urinary tract
   infection with hospital course c/b hematuria with transfusion
   required.  Of note pt. without prolonged antibiotic course (3 days
   Zosyn given).  At that hospital course papillary necrosis considered
   likely source.
   Now patient admit with Sepsis--initial Rx with IVF showing some
   improvement in hemodynamics but only transiently and sepsis catheter
   and pressors required.  She has had continued trend of increasing WBC
   count with persistent bandemia.
   1)Sepsis--The source is clearly likely from her renal collecting
   system.  The reason for such significant hematuria and persistent
   bandemia and refractory sepsis may well be persisent obstruction
   secondary to blood, or nephrolithiasis with partial obstructions with
   stones.  In the setting of recent antibiotics there may well be
   resistant bacteria present.  As far as undrained source there is clear
   concern based on ultrasound.  Overall she has some volume resuscitation
   completed and CVP is considered
optimal
 but with inspiratory fall
   there is a suggestion of some possible need for increased volume
   support.
   -Levo/Vasopressin
to continue with titration to adequate perfusion
   -Meropenem for antibiotics given reasonable coverage
   -Avoid aminoglycosides given worsening renal failure but do need E.
   Coli sensitivies as soon as possible.
   -IVF bolus today for decrease in MAP
which will be driven by MAP
   changes and CVP goal of 12
   -LR as fluid of choice
   -Will check CvO2 to give measure of delivery as we have some concern
   for cardiac compromise with exam suggesting cool extremities.
   -Will check [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim for eval of possible adrenal insufficiency
   -Will add Flagyl for possible C. Diff
   -Will discuss with others but will repeat renal ultrasound and evaluate
   for worsening of evidence of obstruction.
   -Additional issue is possible abscess for drainage which will have to
   be reviewed with radiology directly.
   -Will review primary data from imaging as well.
   2)Acute Renal Failure
This may well be ATN in the setting of sepsis and
   hypotension.  We would raise the issue of possible obstruction and
   there may well be a pre-renal picture as well.  To define primary
   contributors we will
   -Eval with repeat ultrasound to look for worsening obstruction
   -Check renal lytes for evidence of inadequate perfusion
   -Need a direct evaluation of urine for evidence of ATN
   -Will need to maintain adequate perfusion and drainage in the settin of
   ongoing renal impairment.
   2.5)Non-gap metabolic acidosis
will avoid NaCl where possible and given
   preserved hepatic function will utilize LR as possible.
   3)Coagulopathy-[**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to sepsis
replace factors with FFP if
   further increase seen and/or bleeding in renal system suggested.
   4)Anemia
no acute drop, may have been in the setting of previous blood
   loss, chronic iron deficiency anemia and acute sepsis.
   5)Myocardial Ischemia
patient has realy R-wave progression and inferior
   Q-waves which are non-significant by voltage criteria but raises
   concern in the setting of evidence of inadequate perfusion suggested by
   peripheral exam will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, admitted with abdominal pain, renal calculi, and concern for pyelonephritis. She was transferred to the ICU with sepsis, likely from a renal source, and has been treated with IV fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics. Her condition remains unstable, with persistent bandemia, refractory sepsis, and increasing WBC count. The patient has also developed acute renal failure, non-gap metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, anemia, and possible myocardial ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Persistent obstruction: The patient's hematuria and persistent bandemia may be due to persistent obstruction secondary to blood or nephrolithiasis with partial obstruction.
2. Resistant bacteria: The patient has received recent antibiotics, which may have contributed to the development of resistant bacteria.
3. Undrained source: The ultrasound suggests a concern for an undrained source, which needs to be addressed.
4. Cardiac compromise: The patient's cool extremities and possible cardiac compromise need to be evaluated and managed.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's exam suggests possible adrenal insufficiency, which needs to be evaluated.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient is at risk for C. difficile infection, and Flagyl has been added to her treatment regimen.
7. Abscess: The patient has a possible abscess that needs to be evaluated and drained.
8. ATN: The patient's acute renal failure may be due to ATN, which needs to be evaluated and managed.
9. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis needs to be managed, and NaCl should be avoided where possible.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy needs to be managed, and FFP may be necessary if further increase is seen or bleeding occurs.
11. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be managed, and iron supplementation may be necessary.
12. Myocardial ischemia: The patient's possible myocardial ischemia needs to be evaluated and managed.

Action Plan:

1. Continue Levo/Vasopressin to titrate to adequate perfusion.
2. Continue Meropenem for antibiotics, with consideration of changing to a different antibiotic if necessary.
3. Avoid aminoglycosides due to worsening renal failure.
4. Provide IVF boluses as needed to maintain MAP and CVP goals.
5. Monitor CvO2 to evaluate cardiac compromise.
6. Check [Last Name (un) 45] stim for possible adrenal insufficiency.
7. Repeat renal ultrasound to evaluate for worsening obstruction.
8. Evaluate urine for evidence of ATN.
9. Manage non-gap metabolic acidosis by avoiding NaCl and using LR as possible.
10. Manage coagulopathy by replacing factors with FFP if necessary.
11. Manage anemia with iron supplementation if necessary.
12. Evaluate and manage possible myocardial ischemia with F/U ECHO and ECG."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who has been admitted to the ICU due to septic shock, urosepsis, and bilateral hydronephrosis. She has been treated with levophed and vasopressin to maintain her blood pressure, and has received meropenem for her GNR bacteremia. Her urine output has been oliguric, and she has been experiencing bilateral calyceal obstruction by blood, pus, or noncalcified stones.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric urine output and worsening BUN/Cr levels despite volume repletion suggest a high risk of developing AKI.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's oliguria in the setting of sepsis and hypotension increases the risk of developing ATN.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile, including a prolonged INR and trending down platelet count, may increase her risk of bleeding.
4. Demand Myocardial Ischemia: The patient's asymptomatic troponin leak and increasing myocardial demand in the setting of septic shock may increase her risk of developing demand myocardial ischemia.
5. Post-obstructive Uropathy: The patient's bilateral calyceal obstruction by blood, pus, or noncalcified stones may increase her risk of developing post-obstructive uropathy.
6. Analgesic Nephropathy: The patient's history of taking pain medications for her hip and worsening BUN/Cr levels despite volume repletion may suggest a possible diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy.
7. Papillary Necrosis: The patient's bilateral hydronephrosis and worsening BUN/Cr levels may increase her risk of developing papillary necrosis.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's worsening BUN/Cr levels and oliguric urine output may increase her risk of developing renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who developed septic shock due to E. coli bacteremia and left hydronephrosis. She has been treated with antibiotics and is currently off pressors with improved urine output.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocyte count is trending upward, which may indicate a myeloid dyscrasia. Further evaluation, including a smear and serum viscosity, is recommended.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal, post-renal, and ATN. A renal ultrasound and MR urogram are recommended to evaluate the etiology of the calyceal process and left-sided hydronephrosis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is stable, but her platelet count is trending downward. This may be related to sepsis or an evolving dyscrasia. Vitamin K therapy may be necessary if the patient requires a procedure.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is trending downward, which may be related to volume repletion or acute bleeding. Transfusions and erythropoietin therapy may be necessary to maintain a hemoglobin level of 21%.
5. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has infrequent loose stools, which may be related to C. diff infection. Further evaluation, including toxin assays, is recommended.
6. Demand myocardial ischemia: The patient has asymptomatic troponin leakage, which may indicate increased myocardial demand in the setting of septic shock. Repeat EKG and stress testing may be necessary to rule out myocardial infarction.
7. Fibrinolysis: The patient's D-dimer level is elevated, which may indicate a hypercoagulable state. Further evaluation, including a fibrinogen level and thromboelastogram, is recommended.
8. Pressure ulcer prevention: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility. Turning and repositioning every 2 hours, as well as using pressure-reducing mattresses and overlays, are recommended.
9. Infection control: The patient is at risk for secondary infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia. Infection control measures, including hand hygiene and contact precautions, are recommended.
10. Nutrition and glycemic control: The patient is NPO pending possible urological intervention, and her glucose levels are being controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale.

In summary, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including leukocytosis, ARF, coagulopathy, anemia, C. diff infection, demand myocardial ischemia, fibrinolysis, pressure ulcer prevention, infection control, and nutrition and glycemic control. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and urosepsis in the setting of Gram-negative bacteremia and left hydronephrosis. She is currently in septic shock and has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with oliguria. She also has a coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.8 and a trend of decreasing platelet count. The patient has asymptomatic troponin leak, likely due to increased myocardial demand in the setting of septic shock. She is being treated with levophed and vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and is receiving meropenem for coverage of gram-negative rods. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further management is being planned based on her laboratory results and clinical status.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's AKI, coagulopathy, and myocardial ischemia are all potential complications of sepsis.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's oliguria and worsening BUN/Cr ratio suggest the possibility of ATN, which could be related to sepsis, hypotension, or bilateral pyelo.
3. Post-obstructive uropathy: The patient's bilateral calyceal obstruction and worsening BUN/Cr ratio suggest the possibility of post-obstructive uropathy, which could be related to bleeding, infection, or stones.
4. Analgesic nephropathy: The patient's history of pain medication use and worsening BUN/Cr ratio suggest the possibility of analgesic nephropathy.
5. Papillary necrosis: The patient's repeat CT scan and laboratory results suggest the possibility of papillary necrosis, which could be related to her urosepsis and AKI.
6. Coagulopathy-related bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and trend of decreasing platelet count suggest the possibility of bleeding complications.
7. Myocardial infarction: The patient's asymptomatic troponin leak and trend of decreasing troponin levels suggest the possibility of myocardial infarction, which could be related to her septic shock and increased myocardial demand.
8. Renal failure: The patient's AKI and oliguria suggest the possibility of renal failure, which could be related to sepsis, hypotension, or bilateral pyelo.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which could be related to her septic shock and AKI."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo female admit with sepsis following incomplete response to
   treatment for urinary tract infection in past with course complicated
   by signficant hematuria.  The issue was raised as to possible abscess
   which has been fully considered with Urology and Renal assistance and
   given clinical improvement this seems less likely in the setting of
   antibiotic therapy but further imaging when clinically appropriate
   would be suggested.  The specific source of her papillary necrosis
   remains unclear and infiltrative diseases of the kidney are also under
   consideration.
   1)Sepsis
Improved with antibiotic Rx
   -Await GNR speciation
   -CVP goal [**7-15**] and will wean as possible
   -Meropenem to continue
   -[**Last Name (un) **] stim reassuring
   -Will follow up with culture results
   2)Leukocytosis-
   -She retains a significantly elevated WBC count.  This is in the
   setting of 3% bands.  This is possibly ongoing response to incompletely
   treated infection with abscess and/or C-Diff considered most likely.
   In addition, this may well be a primary source from myeloid cell line
   triggered by infectious insult but this was not previously defined.
   -MRI to eval better for focal collection
   -TWBC scan would be reasonable to consider if unable to tolerate MRI
   scan
   -Continue with Flagyl for C-Diff treatment
   -Will need to review smear with Heme to consider if cell differential
   represents accurate counts.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Has had some continued worsening of creatinine and remains oliguric at
   this time
   -Will maintain adequate prefusion and hope for, at least, ATN component
   to resolve although this is a mild contribution to the rnal failure.
   -Will minimize contrast
   3)Hematuria
minimal at this time
will maintain foley support

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -Will need to review smear with Heme to consider if cell differential
   represents accurate counts.
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Has had some continued worsening of creatinine and remains oliguric at
   this time
   -Will maintain adequate prefusion and hope for, at least, ATN component
   to resolve although this is a mild contribution to the rnal failure.
   -Will minimize contrast
   3)Hematuria
minimal at this time
will maintain foley support

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis following an incomplete response to treatment for a urinary tract infection. She has a history of papillary necrosis and is currently undergoing treatment with antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardia, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, and a blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg.
* Respiratory status: SpO2 of 100%, with no respiratory support.
* Cardiovascular status: Sinus rhythm, with a cardiac output of 4.8 L/min.
* Renal status: Oliguric, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP of 16 mmHg, with a total fluid balance of 1,643 mL.
* Laboratory results: WBC count of 75.3 K/uL, with a significant increase in neutrophils and a mild increase in lymphocytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: Continued progression of sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, failure, and death.
* Leukocytosis: Prolonged elevation of WBC count can lead to hematopoietic suppression, infection, and increased risk of bleeding.
* Acute Renal Failure: Continued worsening of creatinine can lead to further kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of death.
* Hematuria: Continued bleeding can lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and increased risk of infection.
* Cardiovascular instability: Tachycardia and hypertension can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of death.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued antibiotic therapy for sepsis.
* Monitoring of WBC count and differential to assess for ongoing response to infection.
* Evaluation of renal function with serial creatinine levels and urine output.
* Monitoring of hemodynamic status with serial CVP and arterial blood pressure readings.
* Consideration of MRI or TWBC scan to evaluate for focal collection.
* Continue treatment for C-Diff with Flagyl.
* Review of smear with Heme to assess cell differential and consider if cell differential represents accurate counts.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently being cared for in the ICU with full support."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent lethargy and
   somnolence.
   .
   #Septic shock
 E.Coli bacteremia, presumed urinary source b/c +U/A.
   HD stable off pressors with improved urine output.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on sensitivity data (day [**3-19**] of
   ABX); requested that meropenem susceptibilty testing be performed on
   isolate
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection;
   hypoxia on ABG c/w volume overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR,
   cannot r/o underlying PNA but no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM to r/o bleed, incr. ICP; defer LP unless mental
   status worsens or focal findings on exam
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, may represent leukemoid rxn in the
   setting of sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum
   viscosity WNL
   -heme to eval. smear
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -Prelim MR read - no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or
   perinephric collection; f/u final read
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance
   .
   #Coagulopathy
 Improving, no s/sx bleeding/clotting; INR trended down
   to 1.5 today but plts also cont. to trend down
   -trend platelets, x-fuse for < 25 or evidence of bleeding
   -elevated fibrinogen not c/w acute DIC; elevated D-dimer non-specific
   -reverse with vitamin K if procedure required
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%
   .
   #C. diff
 infrequent loose BM
s, abd exam benign; toxin assay neg x 2
   -in favor of d/c flagyl, as cov'g for resp anaerobes with zosyn
   .
   #F/E/N
   -if mental status improves, start PO diet; otherwise consider starting
   NG TF
   -volume goal: even to -500 cc/day
   -D5W+150 mEq bicarb @ 125 cc/hr
   -follow lytes [**Hospital1 **], replete PRN with caution given diminished renal fxn
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Respiratory failure due to septic shock, pneumonia, or pleural effusions.
	* Hypoxia and hypercapnia may worsen respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Septic shock may lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
	* Hypotension and decreased cardiac output may exacerbate organ dysfunction.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Delirium and somnolence may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, or other complications.
	* Toxic encephalopathy may cause seizures, altered mental status, or other neurological deficits.
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
	* Volume overload and electrolyte imbalances may worsen AKI.
5. Hematological Complications:
	* Leukocytosis may indicate a leukemoid reaction, which could worsen if left untreated.
	* Coagulopathy may lead to bleeding or clotting complications.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Diarrhea or constipation may worsen malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
	* Infections, such as C. difficile, may cause gastrointestinal symptoms.
7. Infections:
	* E. coli bacteremia may lead to septic shock, organ failure, or death if left untreated.
	* Pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or other infections may complicate the patient's condition.

The patient's medical history and current condition indicate a high risk for these complications. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent or manage these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent lethargy and
   somnolence.
   .
   #Septic shock
 E.Coli bacteremia, presumed urinary source b/c +U/A.
   HD stable off pressors with improved urine output.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on sensitivity data (day [**3-19**] of
   ABX); requested that meropenem susceptibilty testing be performed on
   isolate
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection;
   hypoxia on ABG c/w volume overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR,
   cannot r/o underlying PNA but no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM to r/o bleed, incr. ICP; defer LP unless mental
   status worsens or focal findings on exam
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, may represent leukemoid rxn in the
   setting of sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum
   viscosity WNL
   -heme to eval. smear
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -Prelim MR read - no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or
   perinephric collection; f/u final read
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance

   #Coagulopathy
 Improving, no s/sx bleeding/clotting; INR trended down
   to 1.5 today but plts also cont. to trend down
   -trend platelets, x-fuse for < 25 or evidence of bleeding
   -elevated fibrinogen not c/w acute DIC; elevated D-dimer non-specific
   -reverse with vitamin K if procedure required
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%

* Septic shock due to E. coli bacteremia
* Delirium
* Leukocytosis
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Non-gap metabolic acidosis
* Coagulopathy
* Anemia
* C. difficile infection
* Volume overload

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and vasopressors
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA
* Gentle diuresis to improve respiratory status
* Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins
* Close monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base status
* Consideration of stress-dose steroids for delirium
* Possible placement of a nasogastric tube or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if mental status does not improve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   .
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**3-19**] of ABX); meropenem susceptibility added on later
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -cont. maintenance IVF + bicarb
   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's platelet count is trending downward, and the physician suspects medication-induced thrombocytopenia, possibly due to PPI or antibiotics. The patient's platelet count should be rechecked, and consideration should be given to changing the antibiotic to a different class if the platelet count continues to fall.
2. **Delirium**: The patient is becoming increasingly somnolent and lethargic, with no focal exam findings. The physician suspects toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection and benzodiazepine use for sedation. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and consideration should be given to broadening the antibiotic coverage to include MRSA if the patient's oxygen requirement increases.
3. **Acute Respiratory Failure**: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increasing oxygen requirement. The physician should consider gentle diuresis to improve the patient's respiratory status.
4. **Non-Gap Metabolic Acidosis**: The patient has concomitant respiratory alkalosis based on the ABG results. The physician suspects renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI losses. The patient's urine AG, pH, and FeHCO3 should be checked to characterize the type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and to guide further management.
5. **Anemia**: The patient's anemia is stable, but the physician should continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and consider transfusing if the patient's hemoglobin level falls below 21%.
6. **Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection**: The patient has infrequent loose stools, and the toxin assay is negative. The physician should consider discontinuing the metronidazole and monitoring the patient's stool output.
7. **Fluid Overload**: The patient has a fluid balance of 2,092 mL over the past 24 hours, and the physician should continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust the fluid administration accordingly.
8. **Renal Failure**: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), and the physician should continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the fluid and electrolyte administration accordingly.
9. **Volume Overload**: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions on the chest X-ray, and the physician should consider gentle diuresis to improve the patient's respiratory status.
10. **Infection**: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteremia, and the physician should continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust the antibiotic coverage accordingly.

The patient's medical team should closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and provide optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis and a urinary source identified. The patient has been experiencing worsening mental status, persistent acidemia, and hypoxemia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count decreasing from 75.3 to 50.9
* Hct increasing from 24.9 to 25.4
* Plt decreasing from 257 to 108
* Cr increasing from 1.5 to 2.2
* TropT increasing from 0.06 to 0.06
* TCO2 decreasing from 18 to 12
* Glucose increasing from 62 to 84
* Other labs show elevated levels of ALT, AST, Alk Phos, and LDH

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Well-nourished
* Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 normal, distant
* Peripheral Vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed, Right DP pulse not assessed, Left DP pulse not assessed
* Respiratory/Chest: Expansion symmetric, percussion dullness, breath sounds diminished, crackles throughout
* Abdominal: Soft, bowel sounds present, tender in upper quadrants bilaterally
* Extremities: Right 1+, Left 1+
* Musculoskeletal: Unable to stand
* Skin: Not assessed, small ecchymosis on right wrist
* Neurologic: Responds to verbal stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed, withdrawn

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis: Improving with antibiotics, E. Coli identified on culture, continue Zosyn
* Altered mental status: Minimize sedating medications, Rx underlying infection, head CT for focal findings
* Hypoxemia: Maintain negative fluid balance, wean O2 as possible, OOB
* Leukocytosis: Improving, likely reaction to infection, expect trend to improved status as infection clears
* Thrombocytopenia: Repeat platelet count, change PPI, consider HIT and Rx based on trend today
* ICU care: Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and comments

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis progressing to septic shock
* Worsening of mental status and encephalopathy
* Hypoxemia and respiratory failure
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* HIT and bleeding complications
* Volume overload and pulmonary edema
* Atelectasis and respiratory failure
* C. Diff colitis
* Leukopenia and neutropenia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   .
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**3-19**] of ABX); meropenem susceptibility added on later
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -cont. maintenance IVF + bicarb
   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%
   .
   #C. diff
 infrequent loose BM
s, abd exam benign; toxin assay neg x 2
   -d/c flagyl
   .
   #F/E/N
   -if mental status improves, start PO diet; otherwise consider starting
   NG TF
   -volume goal: even to -500 cc/day
   -D5W+150 mEq bicarb @ 125 cc/hr
   -follow lytes [**Hospital1 **], replete PRN with caution given diminished renal fxn
   .
   #PPx
 venodynes, does not need GI PPx clinically improved and will
   have nutrition today
   .
   #ACCESS  - R IJ, PIV, L rad A-line; consider d/c
ing a-line/central
   line since HD stable off pressors

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who has been admitted to the ICU with urosepsis, delirium, and septic shock. The patient's condition has improved clinically, but they still have persistent delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of E. coli bacteremia, and the urine culture is pending. There is a risk of further infection, particularly with MRSA.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been trending downward since admission, and it is suspected that medication-induced thrombocytopenia may be a contributing factor.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium has not improved, and there is a risk of worsening mental status or development of focal findings on physical examination.
4. ARF: The patient has had an improvement in creatinine levels, but there is still a risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, hypotension, or other factors.
5. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a concomitant respiratory alkalosis, and the cause of the metabolic acidosis is uncertain. There is a risk of worsening acidosis or development of respiratory failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but there is a risk of worsening anemia due to ongoing bleeding or other factors.
7. C. difficile infection: The patient has had a negative C. difficile toxin assay, but there is still a risk of developing C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and other factors.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcer due to sepsis and other factors.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

In terms of management, the patient's antibiotics have been switched to Zosyn, and the plan is to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover MRSA. The patient's platelet count will be rechecked, and consideration will be given to changing antibiotics or discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) if the platelet count continues to fall. The patient's delirium will be monitored, and consideration will be given to starting gentle diuresis to improve respiratory status. The patient's anemia will be monitored, and consideration will be given to transfusing red blood cells if the patient's hemoglobin level falls below 21%. The patient's C. difficile infection will be monitored, and consideration will be given to discontinuing metronidazole if the patient develops C. difficile-associated diarrhea."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia,
   overally clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   .
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**3-19**] of ABX); meropenem susceptibility added on later
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -recheck platelets in PM
   -consider changing zosyn back to [**Last Name (un) 430**] if plts cont. to fall (c/f
   PCN-induced thrombocytopenia)
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium - More somnolent, lethargic, but non-focal exam without
   meningismus; suspect toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection
   and benzos given for sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume
   overload/bilat pleural effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but
   no fever, cough
   -NCCT head this AM but low suspicion for bleed/CVA, incr. ICP; defer LP
   unless mental status worsens or focal findings on PE
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -consider gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.7, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   -cont. maintenance IVF + bicarb
   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   -cont. D5+150 mEq HCO3 @ maintenance
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%
   .
   #C. diff
 infrequent loose BM
s, abd exam benign; toxin assay neg x 2
   -d/c flagyl
   .
   #F/E/N
   -if mental status improves, start PO diet; otherwise consider starting
   NG TF
   -volume goal: even to -500 cc/day
   -D5W+150 mEq bicarb @ 125 cc/hr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who recently had a partially treated urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with septic shock and E. coli bacteremia. She is currently clinically improved but still experiencing delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's platelet count has been trending downward since admission, and the provider suspects medication-induced thrombocytopenia (PPI vs. ABX). They plan to recheck platelets and consider changing antibiotics if the platelet count continues to fall.
2. **Delirium**: The patient's delirium is likely related to toxic encephalopathy in the setting of infection and benzodiazepine use for sedation. The provider plans to broaden antibiotics to cover MRSA if the patient's oxygen requirement increases, and to consider gentle diuresis to improve respiratory status.
3. **Leukocytosis**: The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, likely due to a leukemoid reaction in the setting of sepsis. The provider plans to continue to trend the count and will not pursue further workup at this time.
4. **Acute Renal Failure (ARF)**: The patient's creatinine level has improved, and her urine output is gradually increasing. The provider suspects resolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and hypotension. They plan to continue maintenance IV fluids and bicarbonate replacement.
5. **Non-gap metabolic acidosis**: The patient's acid-base status is likely due to renal bicarbonate losses, dilutional effects, and post-hypocapnic effects. The provider plans to continue D5+150 mEq bicarbonate replacement and will check urine anion gap, pH, and FeHCO3 to characterize the type of renal tubular acidosis.
6. **Anemia**: The patient's anemia is stable, and the provider plans to transfuse if the hemoglobin level falls below 21%.
7. **C. difficile infection**: The patient has infrequent loose stools, but the toxin assay has been negative twice. The provider plans to discontinue metronidazole.
8. **Fluid and electrolyte management**: The patient requires careful fluid and electrolyte management due to her diminished renal function. The provider plans to follow electrolyte levels and replete as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 y/o F w/ Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated
   UTI a/w with septic shock in the setting of E. Coli bacteremia, overall
   clinically improved but with persistent delirium.
   #Septic shock
 Clinically no longer in shock, HD stable off pressors
   with improved UOP, renal function; [**1-7**] E.Coli bacteremia, presumed
   urinary source b/c +U/A.
   -meropenem switched to zosyn based on initial sensitivity data (day
   [**4-18**] of ABX);  will need PICC line
   -may d/c A-line and central line as MAP and CVP have remained at goal
   -adequate response to [**Last Name (un) 45**]-stim test; no indication for addition of
   stress-dose steroids
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and
   other markers of coagulopathy stable
   -platelets are now increasing (108
124); will monitor daily
   -d/c PPI
   -venodynes for DVT PPx
   .
   #Delirium
Somnolence and lethargy improved, confusion persists,
   non-focal physical exam without meningismus; suspect toxic
   encephalopathy in the setting of infection and benzos given for
   sedation for MRI; hypoxia on ABG c/w volume overload/bilat pleural
   effusions on CXR, cannot r/o underlying PNA but no fever, cough
   -NCCT head: normal
   -broaden ABX to cover MRSA if has incr. O2 requirement, purulent
   sputum; sputum GS/Cx if possible
   -continue gentle diuresis to improve resp. status
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Trending down, likely leukemoid rxn in the setting of
   sepsis as latest diff was 99% PMN's, no atypicals; serum viscosity WNL
   -heme thought smear was c/w leukemoid rxn
   -cont. to trend, no further w/u (i.e. marrow Bx) at this time
   .
   #ARF
 Cr improved 2.0 --> 1.3, UOP gradually improving; suspect
   resolving ATN in the setting of sepsis/hypotension although FENa
   indeterminate and no mention of muddy brown casts; hematuria initially
   c/f papillary necrosis vs. malignancy vs. GN, proteinuria c/w nephrotic
   syndrome; rare eos in urine c/w AIN perhaps [**1-7**] quinolone given for UTI
   at OSH; unclear relationship to [**Name (NI) **]
   - encourage po intake
   -MR did not reveal hydronephrosis, renal abscess, or perinephric
   collection
   -UPEP pending
   -appreciate renal recs
   -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #Non-gap met acidosis - Concomitant resp alkalosis based on ABG;
   suspect renal HCO3 losses (NH4 excretion vs. failure of secretion) > GI
   losses as not having freq. diarrhea, as well as some element of
   dilution after aggressive volume repletion and perhaps post-hypocapnic
   effect; consimproved with bicarb replacement in maintenance IVF
   -check urine AG, ph, FeHCO3 to characterize RTA: K has been low c/w
   type II RTA and some causes type I
   .
   #Anemia
 stable, trended down in the setting of volume repletion; no
   s/sx acute bleeding
   -T&C, x-fuse for Hct < 21%
   .
   #C. diff
 infrequent loose BM
s, abd exam benign; toxin assay neg x 2
   -d/c flagyl
   .
   #F/E/N
   -start PO diet;
   -volume goal: even to -500 cc/day
   -follow lytes [**Hospital1 **], replete PRN with caution given diminished renal fxn
   #PPx
 venodynes, does not need GI PPx clinically improved and will
   have nutrition today
   #ACCESS  - R IJ, PIV, L rad A-line; consider d/c

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient's Condition:**
The patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, who developed urosepsis, delirium, and septic shock. She has been treated with antibiotics and is currently clinically improved but still experiencing delirium.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 2.0 to 1.3, but there is a risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, hypotension, and potential nephrotoxic effects of antibiotics.
2. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's platelet count has continued to trend downward, and there is a risk of bleeding due to medication-induced thrombocytopenia (PPI vs. ABX).
3. **Delirium:** The patient's delirium persists, and there is a risk of worsening due to ongoing infection, hypoxia, and potential underlying pneumonia.
4. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, but there is a risk of developing leukostasis due to the high number of neutrophils.
5. **Non-gap Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's acidosis is likely due to renal HCO3 losses and may worsen if not managed properly.
6. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is stable, but there is a risk of worsening due to ongoing bleeding or decreased erythropoiesis.
7. **C. difficile:** The patient's symptoms of diarrhea are infrequent, but there is a risk of developing C. difficile-associated diarrhea due to antibiotic use.
8. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and sepsis.
9. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** The patient is at risk of developing PE due to DVT and sepsis.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust antibiotics and fluids as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with sedation and antipsychotic medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate replacement and monitoring of urine AG, pH, and FeHCO3.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's C. difficile symptoms and consider further evaluation if necessary.
8. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT and PE prevention.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed."

 No S/Sx bleeding; plts have continued to trend
   downward since admission; suspect medication-induced (PPI vs. ABX); did
   receive SQH initially, is in the range for non-Ab mediated HIT; sepsis
   likely playing a role; unlikely in acute DIC as fibrinogen high and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, recent partially-treated UTI, and septic shock. She has been clinically improved but still has persistent delirium.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis with a trend downward, likely due to a leukemoid reaction in the setting of sepsis
* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 26, which is concerning for medication-induced thrombocytopenia, possibly due to PPI or antibiotics
* Elevated lactate levels, which may indicate sepsis-related metabolic acidosis
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, which is stable and not indicating acute bleeding
* Elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema on chest X-ray
* Moderate right and large left pleural effusions on chest X-ray
* Bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray

The patient's imaging results show:

* Non-contrast head CT: normal
* Contrast-enhanced head CT: normal
* Chest X-ray: moderate right and large left pleural effusions, worsening mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema
* Urine culture: pending
* Blood culture: pending

The patient's clinical assessment shows:

* Septic shock: clinically improved, off pressors, and with improved urine output and renal function
* Delirium: persistent, with a non-focal examination and no meningismus
* Thrombocytopenia: likely medication-induced, possibly due to PPI or antibiotics
* Anemia: stable, with no signs of acute bleeding
* Leukocytosis: trending downward, likely due to a leukemoid reaction
* ARF: improving, with a decreasing creatinine level and improving urine output

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics to cover E. coli bacteremia
* Monitoring platelet counts and considering changing antibiotics if platelet counts continue to fall
* Considering gentle diuresis to improve respiratory status
* Broadening antibiotics to cover MRSA if oxygen requirements increase
* Continuing maintenance IV fluids and bicarbonate
* Reassessing renal function and adjusting medications as needed
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding or coagulopathy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as AKI, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular instability
* Delirium-related complications, such as falls, pressure ulcers, or medication errors
* Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding or coagulopathy
* Anemia-related fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased exercise tolerance
* Leukocytosis-related complications, such as leukostasis or leukemic transformation
* ARF-related complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or cardiovascular instability
* Pneumonia-related complications, such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or empyema
* Pleural effusion-related complications, such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or empyema
* C. difficile-related complications, such as colitis, sepsis, or toxic megacolon"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female admitted with urosepsis, which has shown substantial improvement. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 102 bpm (normal range: 97-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 157/78 mmHg (normal range: 109-114/54-77 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (normal range: 11-25 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 63.2 (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 125 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28.3 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging results show:

* Chest X-ray: Resolved right-sided effusion and improving left-sided pulmonary congestion.

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Well-nourished
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, dullness to percussion, and crackles at the bases
* Abdominal: Soft and obese
* Neurological: Alert, follows simple commands, oriented to place, and responds to redirection

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the presence of infection and the potential for further bacterial growth.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and the patient may require further evaluation and management to prevent further kidney damage.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is improving, but the patient may still require further evaluation and management to prevent further cognitive decline.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and the patient may require further evaluation and management to prevent further bleeding complications.
* Vascular access complications: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, and the patient may be at risk for complications such as infection, bleeding, or thrombosis.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to promote diuresis and monitor the patient's fluid status.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust management accordingly.
* Continue to evaluate and manage the patient's altered mental status.
* Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust management accordingly.
* Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's thrombocytopenia.
* Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's vascular access complications."
