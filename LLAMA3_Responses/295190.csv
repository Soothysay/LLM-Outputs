   pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer s/p ilieal
   conduit, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe nongap
   metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).  Most likely related
   to underlying low bicarb in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated
   by poor PO intake.  Received NaHCO3 & D5W yesterday
   - Cont. D5W, increased to 250 mL/hr
   - Follow lytes Q4H
   - Pt. can drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.  Mental status much
   improved today.

   # Renal failure - acute on chronic.  Recent creatinine from VA records
   = 1.7.  Still above baseline, but much improved today.  Patient has
   impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely.   Urine ultrasound
   wnl.  Per VA records pt. has previous history of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Acute worsening of renal function likely a mix of pre-renal
   and metabolic abnormalities on presentation.
   - urine lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology following, their recs appreciated.  \
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes on presentation.  Hyperkalemia now
   resolved.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 7L today.  Elevation in Na
   overnight likely related to combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and
   impressive urine output, likely very dilute.
   - cont. free water repletion with D5W

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, hypertension, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer. He was found unresponsive at home and was brought to the hospital with severe non-gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Severe metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap
* Hyperkalemia
* Mild anemia
* Elevated creatinine levels
* Impressive urine output

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Normal vital signs
* No acute distress
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Normal peripheral pulses
* No cyanosis or clubbing

The patient's medical history is significant for:

* EtOH abuse
* HTN
* Hypothyroidism
* Neuropathic pain
* Type 2 diabetes
* Bladder and prostate cancer
* Previous history of acute on chronic renal failure

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued D5W infusion
* Increased fluid intake to thirst
* Follow-up on electrolytes every 4 hours
* Renal consultation and nephrology follow-up
* Hold on antibiotics unless fevers or other signs of infection
* Consider urology consultation
* Trial of hydralazine for hypertension
* Continue free water repletion with D5W
* Allow patient to drink water now that mental status has improved

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to underlying chronic kidney disease
* Respiratory acidosis due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Hyperkalemia leading to cardiac arrhythmias
* Metabolic acidosis leading to decreased level of consciousness and respiratory depression
* Infection due to urinary tract catheterization
* Fluid overload due to excessive fluid administration
* Hypertension due to underlying medical conditions
* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 M with PMH of EtOH abuse, HTN, hypothyroidism, neuropathic
   pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer s/p ilieal
   conduit, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe nongap
   metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).  Most likely related
   to underlying low bicarb in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated
   by poor PO intake.  Received NaHCO3 & D5W yesterday
   - Cont. D5W, increased to 250 mL/hr
   - Follow lytes Q4H
   - Pt. can drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.  Mental status much
   improved today.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure - acute on chronic.  Recent creatinine from VA records
   = 1.7.  Still above baseline, but much improved today.  Patient has
   impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely.   Urine ultrasound
   wnl.  Per VA records pt. has previous history of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Acute worsening of renal function likely a mix of pre-renal
   and metabolic abnormalities on presentation.
   - urine lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology following, their recs appreciated.  \
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes on presentation.  Hyperkalemia now
   resolved.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 7L today.  Elevation in Na
   overnight likely related to combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and
   impressive urine output, likely very dilute.
   - cont. free water repletion with D5W
   - allow patient to drink water now that MS has improved
   - urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. Is on lisinopril as an outpatient, but will hold this
   medication given current acute worsening of renal function.
   - will trial hydralazine today
   .
   # PPx: H2 blocker, bowel reg, sc heparin
   .
   # Code: presumed full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU, can likely be called out to floor tomorrow.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 66 yo M with  bladder / prostate cancer with
   renal diversion, EtOH abuse, HTN, DM2 admitted with NAG acidosis,
   hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and ARF. Found down by family with profound
   aciosis, pH 7.0. Yesterday had A-line placed, renal us unremarkable,
   bicarb and D5, renal consult appreciated, insulin regimen increased.
   Had run wide complex tachycardia last night, HD stable.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2   Tc 97.8 BP 132/65 HR 68-94 RR 18 with sat 99
   on RA, - 1 Liter  More alert (oriented X 3, only confused about
   which hospital but knows he is in ICU), cooperative, in NAD. CTA B rrr
   Soft NT +BS. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 3.7, HCT 31.4, na 155, K+
   4.0, Cr 2.4 (coming down). No new CXR; MICRO with urine GNRs --> 100K e
   coli ( [**5-15**] rbc and wbc on u/a)
   66 yo M who presented with profound NAG acidosis and ARF.
   Agree with plan to continue rehydration with NaHCO3 IVP and
   aggressive IV D5W repletion for acidosis and hypernatremia.
   Hyperkalemia has resolved.  AMS likely related to electrolyte
   abnormlaities and hypernatremia, now much improved. Appreciate renal
   input.  ARF is improving (VA OSH lab of 1.7 cr-? baseline). U/a with >
   100K e coli but given diversion suspect this is colonization as [**5-15**]
   rbc and wbc on u/a, remains af, and hemodynamically stable. Will need
   RISS for hyperglycemia in the setting of DM2 and aggressive D5W
   repletion. Will continue CIWA for possible etoh withdrawal-though has
   not required. Will start hydral for htn. OSH records list lisinopril,
   but will continue to hold given ARF. Will restart synthroid (check TSH)
   and asa. Advance diet with supervision. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above. Improving clinically but continue in ICU for now.  Monitor tachy
   runs on tele and follow lytes closely. Anticipate transition to floor
   tomorrow.
   Patient is critically ill.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   conduit, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe nongap
   metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).  Most likely related
   to underlying low bicarb in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated
   by poor PO intake.  Received NaHCO3 & D5W yesterday
   - Cont. D5W, increased to 250 mL/hr
   - Follow lytes Q4H
   - Pt. can drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.  Mental status much
   improved today.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure - acute on chronic.  Recent creatinine from VA records
   = 1.7.  Still above baseline, but much improved today.  Patient has
   impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely.   Urine ultrasound
   wnl.  Per VA records pt. has previous history of acute on chronic renal
   failure.  Acute worsening of renal function likely a mix of pre-renal
   and metabolic abnormalities on presentation.
   - urine lytes
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology following, their recs appreciated.  \
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes on presentation.  Hyperkalemia now
   resolved.  Will continue to follow.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 7L today.  Elevation in Na
   overnight likely related to combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and
   impressive urine output, likely very dilute.
   - cont. free water repletion with D5W
   - allow patient to drink water now that MS has improved
   - urine lytes
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. Is on lisinopril as an outpatient, but will hold this
   medication given current acute worsening of renal function.
   - will trial hydralazine today

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 66 yo M with  bladder / prostate cancer with
   renal diversion, EtOH abuse, HTN, DM2 admitted with NAG acidosis,
   hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and ARF. Found down by family with profound
   aciosis, pH 7.0. Yesterday had A-line placed, renal us unremarkable,
   bicarb and D5, renal consult appreciated, insulin regimen increased.
   Had run wide complex tachycardia last night, HD stable.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2   Tc 97.8 BP 132/65 HR 68-94 RR 18 with sat 99
   on RA, - 1 Liter  More alert (oriented X 3, only confused about
   which hospital but knows he is in ICU), cooperative, in NAD. CTA B rrr
   Soft NT +BS. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 3.7, HCT 31.4, na 155, K+
   4.0, Cr 2.4 (coming down). No new CXR; MICRO with urine GNRs --> 100K e
   coli ( [**5-15**] rbc and wbc on u/a)
   66 yo M who presented with profound NAG acidosis and ARF.
   Agree with plan to continue rehydration with NaHCO3 IVP and
   aggressive IV D5W repletion for acidosis and hypernatremia.
   Hyperkalemia has resolved.  AMS likely related to electrolyte
   abnormlaities and hypernatremia, now much improved. Appreciate renal
   input.  ARF is improving (VA OSH lab of 1.7 cr-? baseline). U/a with >
   100K e coli but given diversion suspect this is colonization as [**5-15**]
   rbc and wbc on u/a, remains af, and hemodynamically stable. Will need
   RISS for hyperglycemia in the setting of DM2 and aggressive D5W
   repletion. Will continue CIWA for possible etoh withdrawal-though has
   not required. Will start hydral for htn. OSH records list lisinopril,
   but will continue to hold given ARF. Will restart synthroid (check TSH)
   and asa. Advance diet with supervision. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above. Improving clinically but continue in ICU for now.  Monitor tachy
   runs on tele and follow lytes closely. Anticipate transition to floor
   tomorrow.
   Patient is critically ill.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, hypertension, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer with an ileal conduit. He was found unresponsive at home and was admitted to the ICU with severe non-gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now able to interact and speak clearly.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Severe metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 10
* Hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 4.0 mmol/L
* Acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL
* Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL
* Hypernatremia with a sodium level of 155 mmol/L

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing rehydration with sodium bicarbonate and D5W to treat metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia
* Monitoring for and treating hyperkalemia
* Following the patient's electrolyte levels closely
* Restarting synthroid and aspirin
* Advancing the patient's diet with supervision
* Monitoring the patient's tachy runs on telemetry and following his lytes closely

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Continued deterioration of the patient's renal function
* Development of respiratory acidosis
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia
* Increased risk of seizures due to electrolyte imbalances
* Infection due to the patient's ileal conduit and potential colonization with E. coli
* Further worsening of the patient's mental status due to electrolyte imbalances and hypernatremia
* Development of acute tubular necrosis due to the patient's acute renal failure."

   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).
   - sodium bicarb in D5W
   - appreciate tox recs
   - consider start fomepizole, 15mg/kg IV loading dose.
   - send methanol and ethylene glycol levels STAT to [**Hospital1 1910**] (per tox).
   - ARF workup and management as detailed below.
   - serum osmolality for osmol gap
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as

   # Renal failure. Acute vs. acute on chronic.  Baseline unknown.  Has
   reported history of obstruction so postrenal is a possibility.
   Intrarenal still on differential as is prerenal considering his unknown
   length of time down.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   66 M with unclear PMH, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe
   nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).
   - sodium bicarb in D5W
   - appreciate tox recs
   - consider start fomepizole, 15mg/kg IV loading dose.
   - send methanol and ethylene glycol levels STAT to [**Hospital1 1910**] (per tox).
   - ARF workup and management as detailed below.
   - serum osmolality for osmol gap
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure. Acute vs. acute on chronic.  Baseline unknown.  Has
   reported history of obstruction so postrenal is a possibility.
   Intrarenal still on differential as is prerenal considering his unknown
   length of time down.
   - Obtain baselines
   - urine lytes
   - renal u/s
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology aware, will see in AM.
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes.  Suspect he will not cooperate
   with kayexalate.
   - trend K, if worsens/develops EKG changes, can consider insulin, etc.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 3-4 L.
   - free water repletion.
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. unknown if currently treated.
   - no antihypertensives for now as not significantly hypertensive
   - medication reconciliation.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home and was brought to the hospital with severe nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure. He has unclear past medical history and is currently intubated and sedated. His laboratory results show an anion gap acidosis, likely due to acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia. He has a positive urine analysis, but the anatomy is unclear. He also has hypernatremia, anemia, and a history of hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if it worsens or develops acute EKG changes.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even death.
4. Infection: The patient's positive urine analysis and unclear anatomy may indicate a urinary tract infection, which could lead to sepsis and further complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may lead to further complications if not managed properly, particularly if he becomes hypertensive during his hospital stay.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's hypernatremia and anemia may lead to fluid overload if not managed properly, particularly if he receives excessive fluids or has a high sodium intake.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and unclear past medical history may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if he is taking anticoagulant medications or has a history of bleeding disorders.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's intubation and sedation may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or respiratory failure if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's laboratory results and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and manage his acidosis, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure properly to prevent further complications."
