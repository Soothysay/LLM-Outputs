You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia and a history of abdominal pain, kidney stone, and cardiac conditions. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 73-76 bpm
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 86% on 3L NC and 95% on BiPAP
* Blood pressure: Not mentioned

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished general appearance
* No signs of respiratory distress
* Soft and non-tender abdomen
* No lower extremity edema

Laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 2.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 37,000 cells/mm³
* Platelet count: 12,000 cells/mm³
* Blood urea nitrogen: Not mentioned
* Creatinine: 1.4-6 mg/dL (baseline)
* Electrolyte levels: Not mentioned

Imaging studies show:

* New bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray
* Atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxemia: Continue BiPAP and diurese as tolerated, suspecting pulmonary edema, aspiration, pneumonia, or drug reaction.
* Kidney stone: Supportive care, continue empiric antibiotics, and discuss with urology about potential stone removal.
* Worsening renal function: Concerning despite IVF over the past 1-2 days, may need stone removed.
* Atrial fibrillation: Hold coumadin and continue metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Given the patient's hypoxemia and new infiltrates on chest X-ray, there is a risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's worsening renal function and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of cardiac conditions increase the risk of cardiac complications.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and kidney stone may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as perforation or obstruction.
* Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and history of chronic kidney disease increase the risk of renal failure."

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia, abdominal pain, and a history of left kidney stone with edema and stranding of kidney. He has a language barrier and is unable to provide a history. His medical history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. He has also had a gastrointestinal bleed, chronic respiratory insufficiency, and emphysema.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.6°C, HR = 73 bpm, RR = 24 inspirations per minute, SpO2 = 86%
* Respiratory support: BiPAP mask with 15 L O2
* Physical examination: Well-nourished, no signs of distress, soft abdomen, and no edema
* Laboratory results: WBC = 12,000/mm3, Hb = 10.7 g/dL, Plt = 250,000/mm3, Cr = 1.4-6 mg/dL, and INR = 2.7
* Imaging studies: CXR shows new bilateral patchy infiltrates

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypoxemia is suspected to be due to pulmonary edema, less likely aspiration, pneumonia, or drug reaction. He will continue to receive BiPAP and diuretic therapy as tolerated.

The patient's kidney stone will be managed with supportive care and empiric antibiotics, and the possibility of stone removal will be discussed with urology.

The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with metoprolol, and Coumadin will be held.

The patient will be maintained on NPO status and will receive stress ulcer prophylaxis. VAP and DVT prophylaxis will also be implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's hypoxemia and new infiltrates on CXR suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine level is increasing despite IVF therapy, which may indicate a need for further intervention, such as stone removal or hemodialysis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleed and abdominal pain suggest the possibility of ongoing bleeding, which can worsen his condition and increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory support with BiPAP suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can worsen his condition and increase the risk of mortality.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of coronary artery disease suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure."

   CP, but will rule out MI. PE unlikely given that the patient is
   therapeutic on coumadin. Patient also has 40 pack year smoking history
   and ?diagnosis of emphysema. Will tolerate O2 sats in low 90s. Given
   that patient has received continue IVFs over 1.5 days for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the MICU with flank pain, found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, OSA, HTN, CKD, and 40 pack year smoking history.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypoxia: requiring 5L NC oxygen, with a SpO2 of 85-90%
* Kidney stone: with a 2.5mm left mid ureteral stone, left perinephric stranding, and mild renal edema
* Acute on chronic renal disease: with a creatinine level of 2.7 and unclear etiology of chronic disease
* Atrial fibrillation: rate-controlled on metoprolol and therapeutic on coumadin
* Chronic systolic heart failure: with an EF of 40%

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Aspiration event: due to the patient's history of OSA and hypoxia
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): despite being therapeutic on coumadin, the patient's history of smoking and emphysema increases the risk
* Myocardial infarction (MI): given the patient's history of CAD and atrial fibrillation
* Fluid overload: due to the patient's history of nephrolithiasis and chronic kidney disease
* Worsening renal failure: given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury
* Infection: due to the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of a kidney stone

The plan of care includes:

* Repeat CXR in the morning to rule out pneumonia
* Goal of -1L fluid balance today
* Continue home CPAP settings for OSA
* Obtain EKG to rule out MI
* Hold IV fluids given new hypoxia
* Continue Flomax and lasix for kidney stone
* Dose medications renally
* Avoid nephrotoxins
* Hold lisinopril for ARF
* Repeat Cr in the morning
* F/U CT abdomen to look for hydronephrosis
* Send urine lytes

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications, and to optimize their condition for transfer to the floor when clinically stable."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with flank pain, found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, OSA, HTN, CKD, and a 40-pack-year smoking history.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.6°C, HR 72 bpm, BP 127/61 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2 92%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 1,050 mL of IV fluids and has a urine output of 1,050 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a bipap mask.
* Physical examination: The patient is pleasant and responds to verbal commands, but neurological examination is not assessed.
* Labs/Radiology: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, CK 364, CKMB 6, and INR 3.8. The CT abdomen/pelvis shows a left mid ureteral stone, left perinephric stranding, and mild renal edema.

The patient's conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation has improved after receiving IV lasix. The patient is at risk for fluid overload and further hypoxia.
2. Kidney Stone: The patient's first kidney stone is likely secondary to obesity, HTN, and history of thyroidectomy. The patient's renal function is worsening, and they have a risk of further complications.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Disease: The patient's acute change in renal function may be secondary to the obstructing stone. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology of chronic renal disease.
4. HTN: The patient's HTN is being managed with amlodipine and metoprolol, but they are at risk for further complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with metoprolol and therapeutic INR. The patient is at risk for further complications, such as stroke or bleeding.
6. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40%. They are at risk for further complications, such as worsening heart failure.
7. OSA: The patient has a history of OSA and is being treated with CPAP.
8. H/O PUD/Gastritis: The patient has a history of PUD/gastritis and is being treated with a PPI.
9. s/p Thyroidectomy and Parathyroidectomy: The patient has a history of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy and is being treated with levothyroxine and calcitriol.
10. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with fluoxetine and trazadone.

The patient's current medications include:

* Lasix
* Flomax
* Ceftriaxone
* Dilaudid
* Zofran
* Amlodipine
* Metoprolol
* Levothyroxine
* Calcitriol
* Fluoxetine
* Trazadone
* PPI

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat CXR in the morning
* Continue IV lasix
* Cycle cardiac enzymes
* Obtain EKG
* Continue home CPAP settings for OSA
* Urology consult
* Hold IV fluids given new hypoxia
* Continue Flomax and lasix
* Dilaudid for pain control
* Zofran for nausea
* Strain urine
* Ceftriaxone for possible infected stone
* Renally dose meds
* Avoid nephrotoxins
* Hold lisinopril
* Repeat Cr in the morning
* Renal ultrasound
* Send urine lytes

The patient's disposition is to the floor when they are stable on room air."

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old man admitted to the MICU with flank pain, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypoxia. He has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, OSA, HTN, CKD, and 40-pack-year smoking history. He has been treated with IV fluids for nephrolithiasis, but fluid overload is suspected. The patient has developed atrial fibrillation and is being treated with anticoagulation therapy. He also has a history of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by fluid overload and atrial fibrillation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may lead to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's perinephric stranding and neutrophilic predominance in the WBC count may indicate an infected kidney stone, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of PUD/Gastritis and continued use of PPI may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
6. Thyroid complications: The patient's history of thyroidectomy and continued use of levothyroxine may lead to thyroid-related complications, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
7. Parathyroid complications: The patient's history of parathyroidectomy and continued use of calcitriol may lead to parathyroid-related complications, such as hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia.
8. Depression: The patient's history of depression and continued use of fluoxetine and trazadone may lead to worsening depression or suicidal ideation.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, including regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory results, and medication adjustments."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, OSA, HTN, CKD, and a 40-pack-year smoking history, admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. He is currently in the MICU due to hypoxia and fluid overload. His vital signs are stable, but he is anxious and complaining of abdominal pain. He has a mild fullness of the left kidney on renal ultrasound and no hydronephrosis in the right kidney. His laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, and his urine output is good. He is receiving diuretic therapy and has a pending renal ultrasound.

Potential medical complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease. He is at risk for further renal failure, which could lead to end-stage renal disease.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, which could lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient has a perinephric stranding, which could indicate an infected kidney stone. He is receiving antibiotics for this, but he is at risk for further infection.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which could lead to further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
5. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40%. He is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
6. Obstructive sleep apnea: The patient has a history of OSA, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and stroke.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which could lead to further complications such as suicidal ideation, substance abuse, and poor adherence to treatment.

Based on the patient's history and laboratory results, it is essential to monitor his vital signs closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed. He should continue to receive diuretic therapy and antibiotics for his infected kidney stone. He should also be monitored for signs of further renal failure, fluid overload, and cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, OSA, HTN, CKD, and 40-pack-year smoking history. He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 140/42 mmHg (68/34 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial Fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 180 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypoxia: Fluid overload, which improved with IV lasix
* Kidney stone: Patient's first kidney stone, risk factors include obesity, HTN, and history of thyroidectomy
* Acute on chronic renal disease: Unclear etiology of chronic disease, acute change in function may be secondary to obstructing stone
* HTN: Continuation of amlodipine and metoprolol, hold lisinopril for ARF
* Atrial fibrillation: Rate-controlled on metoprolol and therapeutic on coumadin, INR 2.7
* Chronic systolic heart failure: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 40%, appears mildly hypervolemic
* OSA: CPAP
* H/O PUD/Gastritis: PPI
* s/p thyroidectomy: Continue levothyroxine
* s/p parathyroidectomy: Continue calcitriol
* Depression: Continue fluoxetine and trazadone prn

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of acute renal failure
* Increased risk of sepsis due to perinephric stranding
* Increased risk of cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation and chronic systolic heart failure
* Increased risk of respiratory complications due to OSA and hypoxia
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal complications due to PUD/Gastritis
* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances due to chronic kidney disease and diuretic therapy

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions closely. The patient should continue to receive IV lasix and diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload and acute renal failure. The patient should also continue to receive cardiac medications, including metoprolol and amlodipine, to manage atrial fibrillation and chronic systolic heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a 40-pack-year smoking history. He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypoxia and fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/54 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 89% on 4-5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. His cardiac enzymes are flat, and his liver enzymes are unremarkable.

The patient's abdominal pain is likely secondary to the kidney stone, but he is also experiencing constipation and epigastric tenderness. He has a history of thyroidectomy and is taking levothyroxine and calcitriol. He has also been prescribed fluoxetine and trazadone for depression.

The patient's kidney function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 53 mg/dL. He is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of a kidney stone.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of a kidney stone put him at risk for AKI.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload is likely secondary to his kidney stone and may exacerbate his AKI.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be secondary to his fluid overload and may worsen his AKI.
4. Infection: The patient's perinephric stranding on imaging suggests the possibility of an infected kidney stone.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation put him at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's constipation and epigastric tenderness may worsen his abdominal pain and increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxia and fluid overload may worsen his respiratory status, increasing his risk for respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
2. Consider adding a loop diuretic to help manage the patient's fluid overload.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain and constipation with medication and bowel regimens.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to cover the possibility of an infected kidney stone.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider adding a respiratory therapist to help manage the patient's respiratory status.
7. Continue to educate the patient and his family on his condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 M w/ pmh of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), CAD, OSA, HTN,
   CKD, 40 pack year smoking history admitted w/ flank pain, found to have
   kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure, being transferred to
   the MICU for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Fluid Overload. Improved oxygen saturation after IV lasix.
   Stable on 6L NC.  CXR minimally improved volume status today.  Cardiac
   Enzymes flat.
   -FU repeat CXR in AM
   - Lasix 40mg IV - > I/Os goal -2L today.
   -repeat EKG in AM
   -continue home CPAP settings for OSA at night
   #) Kidney Stone: Patient's first kidney stone, risk factors include
   obseity, HTN and patient with history of thyroidectomy for medullary ca
   so on calcitriol. Renal function at baseline (Cr 1.4-1.7), 2.3 on
   admission, now 3.2. Patient has good urine output. This could
   potentially be secondary to stone. Renal ultrasound without
   hydronephrosis.
   -continue Flomax and lasix
   -Dilaudid for Pain control
   -Zofran for nausea
   -strain urine
   -Ceftriaxone for possible infected stone given perinephric stranding
   WBC count with neutrophillic predominence
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephro-toxins
   - hold lisinopril
   - repeat Cr in AM.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Disease: Unclear etiology of Chronic Disease.
   Acute change most likely secondary to poor forward flow. However no
   clear evidence of hydroureter.  FeUrea 53%, pointing toward intrinsic
   etiology.
   -          Repeat creatinine this afternoon
   -          Renally dose meds
   .
   #) HTN:
   -continue metoprolol, consider increasing metoprolol prn bp control.
   -hold lisinopril for ARF
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: rate controlled on metoprolol and therapeutic
   on coumadin. INR 2.7.
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic, restart when low therapeutic
   range.
   - continue metoprolol
   - daily INR
   .
   #) Chronic systolic heart failure: [**1-20**] non-ischemic cardiomyopathy w/
   EF 40%. Appears mildly hypervolemic.
   - continue b-blocker
   -continue lasix
   - holding lisinopril

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of fluid overload in the setting of IVF for nephrolithiasis. The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, CAD, OSA, HTN, CKD, and 40-pack-year smoking history.

The patient was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. He was transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/54 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 89% on 6L nasal cannula. He has bilateral basilar rales on pulmonary examination and minimal distension with bowel sounds on abdominal examination.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 180 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* TCO2: 22 mmHg
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is -1160 mL, and he has received a total of 1180 mL of IV fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 89% on 6L nasal cannula, and he has bilateral basilar rales on pulmonary examination, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, which may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury or worsening of his chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of perinephric stranding on CT scan, which may indicate an infected kidney stone. He is receiving ceftriaxone for possible infected stone.
5. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid balance is -1160 mL, which may indicate hypovolemic shock.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's TCO2 level is 22 mmHg, which may indicate metabolic acidosis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is not reported, but his magnesium and phosphorus levels are within normal limits.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Repeat CXR in the morning
* Lasix 40mg IV and goal -2L fluid output
* Repeat EKG in the morning
* Continue home CPAP settings for OSA at night
* Continue Flomax and lasix for kidney stone
* Dilaudid for pain control
* Zofran for nausea
* Strain urine
* Ceftriaxone for possible infected stone
* Renally dose medications
* Avoid nephrotoxins
* Hold lisinopril
* Repeat creatinine in the afternoon

The patient's disposition is to the floor pending clinical improvement."
