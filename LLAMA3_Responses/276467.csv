   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed
   cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30%, who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] w/ symptoms
   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for
   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, admitted to CCU for
   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated overnight for acute-onset of severe
   respiratory distress that was non-responsive to treatment for
   anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after completion of ASA
   desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic reaction to the ASA,
   however the pt did not respond appropriately to treatment of such. He
   also did not respond to treatment of other possible causes of
   respiratory failure in the DDx.
   - check RSBI, attempt SBT and extubation today
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization
   - continue to treat CHF, COPD, and anxiety as below
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - Allergy consult regarding use of ASA now s/p desensitization but with
   ? anaphylactic response
   - viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability, for
   potential PCI of mid-LAD lesion: MRI vs. Thallium, may be done as
   outpatient
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis at OSH prior to transfer, but still overloaded by symptoms
   and exam.
   - continue diuresis with IV Lasix boluses
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   - check TTE for LV function, EF, wall-motion abnormalities, and
   possible apical thrombus
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction.
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization, ? use of ASA going forward
   - PRN Epinephrine, Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, Pepcid
   .
   # ? Apical thromus: OSH TTE unable to adequately assess apex for
   thrombus.
   - continue IV heparin gtt, weight-based protocol
   - f/u TTE to eval for presence of apical thrombus
   - consider bridge to coumadin
   .
   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Now intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress of unknown etiology.
   - continue Solu-Medrol for aggressive treatment of possible COPD
   exacerbation
   - continue Advair, Spiriva
   - PRN albuterol / ipratropium MDIs
   - consider extubation as above if possible
   - consider antibiotics
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 73-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory distress, anaphylaxis, and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed left-dominant coronary artery disease with diffuse lesions. He was intubated and received treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Anaphylaxis: The patient's anaphylactic reaction to aspirin may recur, requiring prompt treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease may increase the risk of thrombus formation, which could lead to myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's diuretic therapy and potential electrolyte losses may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen his cardiac condition.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient's cardiac condition and diuretic therapy may increase the risk of renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Maintain a high level of suspicion for anaphylaxis and treat promptly if it occurs.
3. Continue to treat the patient's cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease with medications and consider further interventions, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cardiac catheterization.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust diuretic therapy as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Consider antibiotics if the patient develops a respiratory infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
7. Consider further interventions, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), if the patient's respiratory status worsens."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of acute on chronic systolic heart failure and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for aspirin desensitization and viability study. He developed severe respiratory distress after completing the aspirin desensitization protocol and was intubated. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with acute exacerbation of COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe respiratory distress and intubation increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly given his underlying COPD and cardiomyopathy.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy and CAD increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's aspirin allergy and recent cardiac catheterization increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if he requires aspirin or other anticoagulant therapy.
4. Infection: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and his underlying COPD and cardiomyopathy may increase his risk of other infections.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's cardiomyopathy and recent cardiac catheterization increase the risk of thrombosis, particularly if he has an apical thrombus.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's diuretic therapy and electrolyte repletion may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GERD and recent cardiac catheterization increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding and perforation.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor his condition closely and adjust his therapy as needed to prevent these potential complications."

   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for
   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, admitted to CCU for
   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated for approximately 12 hours for
   acute-onset of severe respiratory distress that was non-responsive to
   treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after
   completion of ASA desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic
   reaction to the ASA, however the pt did not respond appropriately to
   treatment of such. He also did not respond to treatment of other
   possible causes of respiratory failure in the DDx. Seen by allergy, who
   feel this was anaphylactic reaction to ASA. Would recommend repeat
   trial at desensitization after 2 weeks given current respiratory status
   and COPD flare after reaction.
   - continue to treat COPD and CHF as below
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis, now appears more euvolemic. Repeat TTE here showed EF 15%,
   no wall-motion abnormalities to suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   - change IV Lasix to dialy PO dose
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry, electrolyte repletion
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis. TTE without wall-motion abnormalities to suggest ischemia as
   cause of cardiomyopathy.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - per Allergy, would wait 2 weeks before re-trying ASA desensitization
   given anaphylactic response, no ASA for now
   - will not need viability study or repeat PCI as ischemia not the
   likely cause of cardiomyopathy
   .
   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress likely anaphylactic, which exacerbated underlying severe COPD.
   - change Solu-Medrol to PO Prednisone for rapid taper
   - continue Advair, Spiriva
   - PRN albuterol / ipratropium MDIs
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction. Per Allergy, will need to wait 2 weeks before re-trying ASA
   desensitization.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated for approximately 12 hours for
   acute-onset of severe respiratory distress that was non-responsive to
   treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after
   completion of ASA desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic
   reaction to the ASA, however the pt did not respond appropriately to
   treatment of such. He also did not respond to treatment of other
   possible causes of respiratory failure in the DDx. Seen by allergy, who
   feel this was anaphylactic reaction to ASA. Would recommend repeat
   trial at desensitization after 2 weeks given current respiratory status
   and COPD flare after reaction.
   - continue to treat COPD and CHF as below
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis, now appears more euvolemic. Repeat TTE here showed EF 15%,
   no wall-motion abnormalities to suggest ischemic cardiomyopathy.
   - change IV Lasix to dialy PO dose
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry, electrolyte repletion

   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis. TTE without wall-motion abnormalities to suggest ischemia as
   cause of cardiomyopathy.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - per Allergy, would wait 2 weeks before re-trying ASA desensitization
   given anaphylactic response, no ASA for now
   - will not need viability study or repeat PCI as ischemia not the
   likely cause of cardiomyopathy
   .
   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress likely anaphylactic, which exacerbated underlying severe COPD.
   - change Solu-Medrol to PO Prednisone for rapid taper
   - continue Advair, Spiriva
   - PRN albuterol / ipratropium MDIs
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction. Per Allergy, will need to wait 2 weeks before re-trying ASA

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac catheterization and was found to have left-dominant coronary artery disease with diffuse 20-30% lesions. He also had a severe anaphylactic reaction to aspirin during the desensitization protocol, which led to acute respiratory distress and was treated with intubation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require ongoing mechanical ventilation. Prolonged intubation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can worsen his respiratory function.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy is likely to progress, and he may require further treatment with medications or invasive procedures. He may also be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient has a right groin hematoma, which may require further evaluation and treatment. He may also be at risk for bleeding complications from his cardiac catheterization procedure.
4. Anaphylaxis: The patient's anaphylactic reaction to aspirin may not be fully resolved, and he may be at risk for future anaphylactic reactions to other medications.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD is severe, and he may require ongoing treatment with bronchodilators and corticosteroids. He may also be at risk for future COPD exacerbations.
6. Thrombotic Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac catheterization and may be at risk for thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and may require ongoing treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's assessment and plan should focus on managing his respiratory, cardiac, and COPD symptoms, as well as preventing and treating potential complications. He should continue to receive oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids to manage his respiratory and COPD symptoms. He should also receive anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic complications. His cardiac catheterization procedure should be discussed with him, and he should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of future procedures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac catheterization and ASA desensitization.

The patient experienced an adverse drug event (ADE) and anaphylaxis reaction to ASA, which was treated with epinephrine, Benadryl, and Solu-Medrol. The patient was intubated overnight for severe respiratory distress and was later extubated. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a PaO2 of 97%.

The patient's cardiac status is also stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 87/55 mmHg. The patient's cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant coronary artery disease, with diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and mild luminal irregularities in the left circumflex (LCx) artery.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 273 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L, a magnesium level of 2.3 mmol/L, and a phosphate level of 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's medications include Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker, diuretics, and antibiotics. The patient's diet is regular, and he is being repleted with electrolytes as needed.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but he is at risk for respiratory failure due to his COPD and cardiac disease.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant coronary artery disease, which may increase his risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Bleeding: The patient's cardiac catheterization and ASA desensitization may have caused bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock.
4. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of antibiotics may increase his risk for infection.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants may increase his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's cardiac disease and use of diuretics may increase his risk for renal failure.
7. Hepatic failure: The patient's cardiac disease and use of anticoagulants may increase his risk for hepatic failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive oxygen therapy and will be monitored for respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac management: The patient will continue to receive beta-blocker and diuretic therapy to manage his cardiac disease.
3. Bleeding prevention: The patient will receive anticoagulant therapy to prevent bleeding.
4. Infection prevention: The patient will receive antibiotics to prevent infection.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding prevention: The patient will receive proton pump inhibitors to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Renal failure prevention: The patient will receive diuretic therapy to prevent renal failure.
7. Hepatic failure prevention: The patient will receive anticoagulant therapy to prevent hepatic failure.

The patient's code status is presumed full, and his disposition is to the CCU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 73-yo man w/ severe COPD and recently-diagnosed
   cardiomyopathy w/ EF 30%, who presented to OSH on [**2131-12-21**] w/ symptoms
   of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, transferred here for
   cardiac catheterization that showed LAD disease, admitted to CCU for
   ASA desensitization and viability study.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt intubated for approximately 12 hours for
   acute-onset of severe respiratory distress that was non-responsive to
   treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety. Timing soon after
   completion of ASA desensitization protocol suggests anaphylactic
   reaction to the ASA, however the pt did not respond appropriately to
   treatment of such. He also did not respond to treatment of other
   possible causes of respiratory failure in the DDx. Seen by allergy, who
   feel this was anaphylactic reaction to ASA. Would recommend repeat
   trial at desensitization after 2 weeks given current respiratory status
   and COPD flare after reaction.
   - continue to treat COPD and CHF as below
   .
   # PUMP: Recently diagnosed with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause. OSH
   TTE showed EF 20-25% with global LV HK and chamber dilation. Responded
   to diuresis, now appears more euvolemic.
   - continue diuresis with IV Lasix boluses
   - cont Spironolactone, BB, ACE-I
   - check TTE for LV function, EF, wall-motion abnormalities, and
   possible apical thrombus
   .
   # CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization showed left-dominant system, LAD
   with diffuse 20-30% lesions thoroughout with mid-vessel 80% stenosis,
   and LCx with mild luminal irregularities with mid-vessel eccentric 60%
   stenosis.
   - continue Plavix, lisinopril, beta-blocker
   - Allergy consult regarding use of ASA now s/p desensitization but with
   ? anaphylactic response
   - viability study to assess for antero-apical myocardial viability, for
   potential PCI of mid-LAD lesion: MRI vs. Thallium, may be done as
   outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: NSR w/ LBBB and frequent APCs and PVCs.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - electrolyte repletion
   .
   # ASA allergy: Pt w/ CAD on cardiac cath. Given plan for PCI in future,
   would need to be on ASA. Pt has ASA allergy w/ anaphylaxis, admitted to
   CCU for desensitization. Now s/p completed desensitization protocol,
   but suffered acute respiratory distress afterwards, ? anaphylactic
   reaction.
   - Allergy consult for possibility of anaphylactic reaction to ASA even
   though s/p desensitization, ? use of ASA going forward
   - PRN Epinephrine, Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, Pepcid
   .
   # ? Apical thromus: OSH TTE unable to adequately assess apex for
   thrombus.
   - continue IV heparin gtt, weight-based protocol
   - f/u TTE to eval for presence of apical thrombus
   - consider bridge to coumadin
   .
   # COPD: Pt w/ severe COPD, was being treated as COPD exacerbation at
   OSH prior to transfer. Now intubated for acute-onset severe respiratory
   distress of unknown etiology.
   - continue Solu-Medrol for aggressive treatment of possible COPD
   exacerbation
   - continue Advair, Spiriva
   - PRN albuterol / ipratropium MDIs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac catheterization and desensitization to aspirin (ASA) due to anaphylaxis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to severe respiratory distress, which was non-responsive to treatment for anaphylaxis, COPD, CHF, or anxiety.
* Cardiac status: The patient has recently diagnosed cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-15%. He also has left-dominant coronary artery disease with diffuse 20-30% lesions throughout, and mid-vessel 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 87/55 mmHg, heart rate is 85 beats per minute, and central venous pressure is 7-8 cm.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 273 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding disorder and recent desensitization to ASA may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhage or hematoma.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and potential gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to complications such as aspiration or gastrointestinal perforation.

In summary, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and bleeding complications to prevent further deterioration of his condition."
