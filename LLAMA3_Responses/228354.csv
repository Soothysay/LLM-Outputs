You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 109 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. He has been receiving treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected sepsis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels and liver enzymes suggest possible sepsis-related organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and organ function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest possible acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be necessary.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and respiratory rate suggest possible respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory function and consideration of mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest possible cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring of cardiovascular function and consideration of vasopressors or other cardiovascular support may be necessary.
5. Wound infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and potential wound infection may lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of wound healing and consideration of wound care interventions may be necessary.
6. DVT: The patient's immobilization and potential DVT may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Close monitoring of venous circulation and consideration of anticoagulation therapy may be necessary.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's septic shock and potential stress ulcer may lead to further complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal function and consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis may be necessary.
8. VAP: The patient's mechanical ventilation and potential VAP may lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory function and consideration of VAP prophylaxis may be necessary."

   This is a 64 yo female with a history of pustular psoriasis here with
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Meets SIRS criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with suspected
   source psoriasis flare with superinfection.  Other possible infectious
   etiologies include urinary source.  Of note, acute generalized pustular
   psoriasis in it of itself can cause a similar presentation of acute
   inflammatory response.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Vanc for empric coverage of skin flora
   - Zosyn for GN coverage given UTI with plans to narrow coverage pending
   cultures
   - f/u culture data
   - Cont OSH CVL for now, plan to pull in AM
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim given recent steroid use
   .
   # Pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, feel that this is more
   consistent with pustular psoriasis flare with superinfection than
   generalized pustular psoriasis.
   - Soriatane 50
   - Wound care per dermatology recommendations
   .
   # Renal failure: Presumed acute renal failure, no known baseline.
   Likely [**2-13**] ATN in setting of hypotension/sepsis.  Trending down with
   hydration.
   - Urine lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Obtain baseline renal function
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold antihypertensives in acute setting

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who has developed septic shock. She meets SIRS criteria with suspected source of psoriasis flare with superinfection. Other possible infectious etiologies include urinary source.

The patient is receiving IV fluids to maintain CVP 8-12, IV fluid boluses, and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr. She is also receiving Vanc for empirical coverage of skin flora and Zosyn for GN coverage given UTI with plans to narrow coverage pending cultures.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute pain, and chronic pain. She is at risk for shock, septic, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to septic shock.
2. Progression of renal failure to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Worsening of hypotension and shock, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
4. Development of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
5. Hemodynamic instability, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Neurological complications, such as septic encephalopathy or cerebral edema.
8. Gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
9. Nutritional deficiencies, potentially leading to malnutrition and compromised immune function.
10. Psychological complications, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the

   add the following points:  64F pustular psoriasis and htn p/w
   hypotension / shock and ARF concerning for sepsis or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9140**]

   plan to continue vanco/zosyn following pending cx data.  She is now off
   pressors with normalization of lactate, resolution of her ARF and
   continued adequate u/o.  Would continue maintenance fluids as she has
   significant insensible losses due to skin involvement, though she is
   tolerating Pos.  Would bolus additionally as needed to maintain cvp >
   10, MAP > 60 if BP falls. Given her extensive rash/skin involvement
   would leave her current OSH IJ in place for now, rather than resite. As
   rash heals, would obtain PIVs or picc.  Derm input is appreciated.  We
   await bx results and continue retinoic acid derivative (just now
   available), topical rx and prednisone. Following lfts and lipids. As
   she is recently off pressors, would continue to hold home antihtn
   medication, monitoring BP off pressors. Remainder of plan as outlined
   in resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  64F pustular psoriasis and htn p/w
   hypotension / shock and ARF concerning for sepsis or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9140**]

   plan to continue vanco/zosyn following pending cx data.  She is now off
   pressors with normalization of lactate, resolution of her ARF and
   continued adequate u/o.  Would continue maintenance fluids as she has
   significant insensible losses due to skin involvement, though she is
   tolerating Pos.  Would bolus additionally as needed to maintain cvp >
   10, MAP > 60 if BP falls. Given her extensive rash/skin involvement
   would leave her current OSH IJ in place for now, rather than resite. As
   rash heals, would obtain PIVs or picc.  Derm input is appreciated.  We
   await bx results and continue retinoic acid derivative (just now
   available), topical rx and prednisone. Following lfts and lipids. As
   she is recently off pressors, would continue to hold home antihtn
   medication, monitoring BP off pressors. Remainder of plan as outlined

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock. The patient's condition has stabilized without the need for pressor requirements. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids to maintain a CVP of 8-12, IV fluid boluses, and Levophed to maintain a MAP greater than 65 and UOP greater than 30cc/hr.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 29.8
* Hct: 29.7
* Plt: 429
* Cr: 1.8
* Glucose: 125
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 177 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 1.5 mg/dL

The patient's urine culture grew GNR, and blood cultures are pending. The patient is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric coverage.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
* HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
* Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD, RIJ site clear
* Lungs: Bibasilar crackles, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi
* CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
* Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Skin: Diffuse erythemaous scaly plaques sparing palms, soles, and face

The patient's condition is concerning for sepsis or [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9140**] syndrome with capillary leak and hypovolemia in the setting of fulminant psoriatic flare.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis and hypovolemia
* Hypertension due to underlying pustular psoriasis and potential secondary adrenal insufficiency
* Respiratory failure due to sepsis and hypoxia
* Cardiovascular instability due to sepsis and hypovolemia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration
* Infection-related complications, such as UTI, pneumonia, or skin infections
* Hemodynamic instability due to capillary leak and hypovolemia
* Renal failure due to sepsis and hypovolemia
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, or hypocalcemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuation of IV fluids and Levophed to maintain MAP greater than 65 and UOP greater than 30cc/hr
* Monitoring of CVP, MAP, and UOP
* Follow-up of laboratory results, including WBC, Hct, and Cr
* Monitoring of lactate levels and resolution of ARF
* Continuation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric coverage
* Follow-up of urine and blood cultures
* Dermatology input for wound care and management of psoriatic rash
* Continuation of prednisone and Soriatane for management of psoriatic flare
* Monitoring of BP and holding antihypertensive medication as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock, acute pustular psoriasis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She was treated with IV fluids, pressors, and antibiotics. Her condition has been stable without pressor requirements, and her blood cultures have shown no growth to date. She has a history of acute renal failure, which has resolved, and is currently being treated with prednisone for her psoriasis. She has a UTI with a growing Gram-negative rod (GNR) in her urine and is being treated with Zosyn. She has a code status of full code and is pending hemodynamic stability before disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's condition is currently stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration if the source of the infection is not identified and treated promptly.
2. UTI: The patient's UTI is growing GNR and needs to be followed up to determine the species and treated accordingly.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is a risk of further kidney damage if the patient's blood pressure is not controlled.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled to prevent further kidney damage and other complications.
5. Pustular Psoriasis: The patient's pustular psoriasis needs to be treated to prevent further flares and complications.
6. Wound Care: The patient's skin integrity needs to be monitored and treated to prevent further complications.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and compromised skin integrity.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Follow up on the patient's UTI and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to treat the patient's pustular psoriasis and monitor for further flares.
5. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and adjust wound care as necessary.
6. Consider further testing to determine the source of the patient's infection.
7. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic treatment based on the results of further testing."

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8880**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mrs [**Known lastname 9174**] today looks and feels
   quite well.  Hemodymically she is essentially normal, except for U.O of
   only 30cc/hr which we attribute to excess loss of insensible fluid via
   her inflamed skin.  We will give more IV fluid and blood (Hct only 24)
   to improve what we believe to still be some intravascular volume
   depletion.
   Her psoriasis is much improved with high potency topical steroids under
   occlusion and po prednisone.  We will consult with derm about the
   patient
s slurring of words upon taking Soriatane, to be sure it is
   safe continuing it.
   Her septic shock was likely from staph aureus bacteremia from her
   psoriasis and from a Klebsiella UTI.  We will await final idenfication
   of the organisms and their sensitivities before deciding if a singly
   antibiotic can be used to Rx both infections.  A TTE has been ordered
   to insure there is no evidence of endocarditis.
   If patient continues to look this well, she can be transferred to the
   floor this evening or tomorrow morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   This is a 64 yo female with a history of pustular psoriasis here with
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Resolved, hemodynamially stable. Currently stable
   without any pressor requirements. Upon presentation, patient met SIRS
   criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with suspected source psoriasis flare with
   superinfection.  Other possible infectious etiologies include urinary
   source.  Of note, acute generalized pustular psoriasis in it of itself
   can cause a similar presentation of acute inflammatory response.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Vanc (started [**8-10**]) for empric coverage of skin flora
   - Cipro (coverage since [**8-10**]) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u culture data from OSH and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Cont OSH CVL for now. Need to keep for access.
   .
   # Acute eruption of Pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, feel that
   this is more consistent with pustular psoriasis flare with
   superinfection than generalized pustular psoriasis.  Had slurred
   speech, flushing and pruritic reaction post-Soriatane. Says normal for
   her.
   - Continue  Soriatane 50. f/u with derm about soriatane side effects
   before next dose.
   - Prednisone 10 mg daily (started [**8-10**])
   - Continue Clobetasol
   - Continue Morphine PRN for pain
   - Wound care per dermatology recommendations
   .
   Staph aureus in blood: On vanco
   --Continue Vanco and f/u on Osh sensitivities
   --Will check TTE for endocarditis.
   UTI: growing GNR in urine. Pan sensitive Klebsiella from OSH
   --Follow speciation at [**Hospital1 19**].
   --On Cipro (started [**8-10**])
   # Acute renal failure: Initially,  likely [**2-13**] ATN in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis.  Had low UOP despite boluses. Increase in Cr today
   from 1.1
   - Increase maintainence fluids to NS @200 cc/hr.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8880**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mrs [**Known lastname 9174**] today looks and feels
   quite well.  Hemodymically she is essentially normal, except for U.O of
   only 30cc/hr which we attribute to excess loss of insensible fluid via
   her inflamed skin.  We will give more IV fluid and blood (Hct only 24)
   to improve what we believe to still be some intravascular volume
   depletion.
   Her psoriasis is much improved with high potency topical steroids under
   occlusion and po prednisone.  We will consult with derm about the
   patient
s slurring of words upon taking Soriatane, to be sure it is
   safe continuing it.
   Her septic shock was likely from staph aureus bacteremia from her
   psoriasis and from a Klebsiella UTI.  We will await final idenfication
   of the organisms and their sensitivities before deciding if a singly
   antibiotic can be used to Rx both infections.  A TTE has been ordered
   to insure there is no evidence of endocarditis.
   If patient continues to look this well, she can be transferred to the
   floor this evening or tomorrow morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who has developed septic shock. She is currently stable without any pressor requirements.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F)
* Heart rate: 59 bpm (53-84 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 157/98 mmHg (111-157/98 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (9-25 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Central venous pressure: 17 mmHg (11-17 mmHg)

The patient has been receiving IV fluids to maintain a CVP of 8-12 mmHg, and IV fluid boluses and Levophed have been used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg and a urine output greater than 30 cc/hr.

The patient has a UTI with growth of GNR in the urine, and is being treated with Zosyn. The patient also has a blood culture that has grown Staph aureus, and an OSH culture that has grown Klebsiella, which is pan-sensitive.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which has resolved, and is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and sepsis.

The patient's medications include:

* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Vancomycin
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Morphine sulfate
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Prednisone
* Clobetasol
* Soriatane 50

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 29.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 29.7%
* Platelet count: 429 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 125 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 177 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.4 mg/dL

Based on the patient's laboratory results and medical history, potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further septic shock or organ dysfunction
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Bleeding or thrombosis due to anticoagulation therapy
* Infection or sepsis due to the UTI or blood cultures
* Worsening of pustular psoriasis or development of new skin lesions

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis, currently admitted to the ICU with septic shock. The patient's condition is characterized by:

* Septic shock: Currently stable without pressor requirements, with suspected source of infection being a psoriasis flare with superinfection or a urinary source.
* Acute eruption of pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, this is more consistent with a pustular psoriasis flare with superinfection than generalized pustular psoriasis.
* UTI: Growing GNR in urine, with plans to follow speciation and continue on Zosyn.
* Acute renal failure: Resolved, likely secondary to ATN in the setting of hypotension/sepsis.
* Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in the acute setting.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Septic shock:
	+ Continued hemodynamic instability
	+ Development of organ dysfunction (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury)
	+ Increased risk of mortality
* Acute eruption of pustular psoriasis:
	+ Worsening of skin integrity and increased risk of infection
	+ Potential for systemic complications, such as sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction
* UTI:
	+ Spread of infection to other parts of the body (e.g., bloodstream, kidneys)
	+ Development of antimicrobial resistance
	+ Increased risk of sepsis and mortality
* Acute renal failure:
	+ Progression to chronic kidney disease
	+ Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders
	+ Potential for need for dialysis
* Hypertension:
	+ Development of target organ damage (e.g., heart failure, stroke, kidney disease)
	+ Increased risk of cardiovascular events
	+ Potential for need for antihypertensive medications

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 29.8 K/uL
* Elevated lactate levels at 1.6 mmol/L
* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST) with values of 9-29 IU/L and 92/0.8 IU/L, respectively
* Abnormal kidney function tests (Cr) with a value of 1.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies indicate:

* A chest X-ray showing bilateral pleural effusions
* A CT scan of the abdomen showing a small amount of ascites

The patient's medications include:

* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for UTI
* Vancomycin for skin flora coverage
* Morphine for pain management
* Prednisone for pustular psoriasis
* Clobetasol for skin care
* Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
* IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
* Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
* Vanc for empric coverage of skin flora
* Zosyn for GN coverage
* f/u culture data from OSH and Hospital1 19
* Cont OSH CVL for now. Need to keep for access.
* Wound care per dermatology recommendations
* Follow-up with dermatology and infectious disease services"

   This is a 64 yo female with a history of pustular psoriasis here with
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Resolved, hemodynamially stable. Currently stable
   without any pressor requirements. Upon presentation, patient met SIRS
   criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with suspected source psoriasis flare with
   superinfection.  Other possible infectious etiologies include urinary
   source.  Of note, acute generalized pustular psoriasis in it of itself
   can cause a similar presentation of acute inflammatory response.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Vanc (started [**8-10**]) for empric coverage of skin flora
   - Cipro (coverage since [**8-10**]) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u culture data from OSH and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Cont OSH CVL for now. Need to keep for access.
   .
   # Acute eruption of Pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, feel that
   this is more consistent with pustular psoriasis flare with
   superinfection than generalized pustular psoriasis.  Had slurred
   speech, flushing and pruritic reaction post-Soriatane. Says normal for
   her.
   - Continue  Soriatane 50. f/u with derm about soriatane side effects
   before next dose.
   - Prednisone 10 mg daily (started [**8-10**])
   - Continue Clobetasol
   - Continue Morphine PRN for pain
   - Wound care per dermatology recommendations
   .
   Staph aureus in blood: On vanco
   --Continue Vanco and f/u on Osh sensitivities
   --Will check TTE for endocarditis.
   UTI: growing GNR in urine. Pan sensitive Klebsiella from OSH
   --Follow speciation at [**Hospital1 19**].
   --On Cipro (started [**8-10**])
   # Acute renal failure: Initially,  likely [**2-13**] ATN in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis.  Had low UOP despite boluses. Increase in Cr today
   from 1.1
   - Increase maintainence fluids to NS @200 cc/hr.
   - Consider collod>crystalloid.
   - Continue to trend Cr

* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (normal range: 9-25 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 96% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 29.8 K/Î¼L (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/Î¼L)
* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 315 K/Î¼L (normal range: 150-450 K/Î¼L)
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 125 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's medical history is significant for pustular psoriasis, and she is currently taking Soriatane, Prednisone, and Clobetasol. She has also been experiencing pain, which is being managed with Morphine.

The patient's current medications include:

* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Vancomycin
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Morphine Sulfate
* Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis)
* Cipro (started on 8/10)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to septic shock and hypotension
* Hypertension due to septic shock and medication
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and septic shock
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver failure)
* Endocarditis due to Staph aureus in blood
* UTI due to GNR in urine
* Pustular psoriasis flare-up due to Soriatane
* Hypocalcemia due to prolonged hypotension and septic shock

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
* IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
* Check mixed venous saturation if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
* Vanc (started on 8/10) for empric coverage of skin flora
* Cipro (started on 8/10) for Klebsiella coverage
* Follow-up culture data from OSH and Hospital1

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch-tall male who weighs 109 kg. He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of intermittent chest pain lasting 10 minutes, which is reproducible on the left side of the chest and does not radiate. He also has pruritis post-Soriatane, which is being managed with Benadryl.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin. He has also been receiving anticoagulation therapy with Heparin Sodium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 157/98 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. His temperature is 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. His blood cultures are pending, but urine cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNR) and Klebsiella, which is pan-sensitive.

The patient's physical examination is significant for impaired skin integrity, and he has a code status of full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated WBC count and LDH levels, as well as the presence of Gram-negative rods and Klebsiella in his urine culture, there is a high risk of sepsis.
2. Shock: The patient's low urine output and elevated lactate levels suggest that he may be at risk of shock.
3. DVT: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with Heparin Sodium is prophylactic, but there is still a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
4. VAP: The patient's nasogastric tube and mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's ICU stay and mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing stress ulcers.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases his risk of developing pressure ulcers and other skin complications.
7. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain and acute pain from his Soriatane therapy may lead to chronic pain syndrome.
8. Pruritis: The patient's pruritis from his Soriatane therapy may lead to scratching and skin breakdown.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing sepsis, shock, and other complications related to his underlying medical conditions and ICU care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, 109 kg (admission: 99.5 kg) individual with a chief complaint of intermittent chest pain lasting 10 minutes on the left side of the chest, which is reproducible but does not radiate. The patient has also experienced pruritis post-Soriatane, which is managed with Benadryl. Additionally, the patient has reported verbal slurring post-Soriatane, but says it is normal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 59 bpm (53-84 bpm), blood pressure of 157/98 mmHg (111-157/98 mmHg), and respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute. The patient's SpO2 is 96%, and their heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient has received various medications, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Pantoprazole (Protonix), Morphine Sulfate, and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 29.8-12.2 K/uL
* Hct: 29.7-24.0%
* Plt: 429-315 K/uL
* Cr: 1.8-1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 125-121 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.9/25.9/1.2, ALT / AST: 9-29, Alk Phos / TBili: 92/0.8, Differential-Neuts: 94.2%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 4.1%, Mono: 1.5%, Eos: 0.1%, Lactic Acid: 1.6 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.9 g/dL, LDH: 177 IU/L, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient has had several cultures taken, including urine and blood cultures, which have yielded GNR in the urine, no growth in the blood, and Staph aureus in two of four blood culture bottles.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock due to the patient's low UOP shifts and CVP of 17 mmHg
* DVT due to the patient's immobility and the use of prophylactic heparin
* Stress ulcer due to the patient's critical illness and the use of corticosteroids
* VAP due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of antibiotics
* Impaired skin integrity due to the patient's immobility and the use of invasive lines and devices
* Chronic pain due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of opioids
* Pruritis due to the patient's use of Soriatane and the development of allergic reactions

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications from arising."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
   This is a 64 yo female with a history of pustular psoriasis here with
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Currently stable without any pressor requirements.
   Upon presentation, patient met SIRS criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with
   suspected source psoriasis flare with superinfection.  Other possible
   infectious etiologies include urinary source.  Of note, acute
   generalized pustular psoriasis in it of itself can cause a similar
   presentation of acute inflammatory response.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Vanc (started [**8-10**]) for empric coverage of skin flora
   - Zosyn (started [**8-10**]) for GN coverage given UTI with plans to narrow
   coverage pending cultures
   - f/u culture data from OSH and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Cont OSH CVL for now. Need to keep for access.
   .
   # Acute eruption of Pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, feel that
   this is more consistent with pustular psoriasis flare with
   superinfection than generalized pustular psoriasis.
   - Need to obtain Soriatane 50.
   - Prednisone 10 mg daily (started [**8-10**])
   - Continue Clobetasol
   - Continue Morphine PRN for pain
   - Wound care per dermatology recommendations
   .
   UTI: growing GNR in urine.
   --Follow speciation
   --On Zosyn (started [**8-10**])
   # Acute renal failure: Acute renal failure, resolved.  Likely [**2-13**] ATN
   in setting of hypotension/sepsis.
   - Continue to trend Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock. She has been treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management. Her condition is currently stable, but she remains at risk for complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock has led to acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The growing GNR in her urine and the presence of skin flora in her blood culture suggest that she may have multiple infections, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's chest pain and tachypnea may indicate early signs of ARDS, which could progress to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
5. Wound infection: The patient's skin lesions may be infected, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may exacerbate her condition and increase her risk of complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may indicate early signs of respiratory failure, which could progress to respiratory arrest if not managed promptly.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications due to her septic shock, infections, and underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]
s note above and I
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  She is doing very well
   indeed with continued hemodynamic stability and no evidence of
   continued sepsis.  Her bld cx is growing [**Last Name (STitle) 336**] and her urine cx growing
   2 sensitive species of Klebsiella. The plan is to Rx the former with
   nafcillin IV for 14 days, for which a PICC will be needed.  The latter
   organisms are and will be treated with Cipro.
   She
s gotten a lot of IVF for resuscitation over the past 3 days and is
   total body fluid overloaded.  She has mild SOB, CVP of 15, and even her
   mild increase in Creat we think may be due to her being on the
   descending limb of her cardiac Starling curve with decreased forward
   flow to her kidneys (vs some ATN from prior sepsis).  We will thus Rx
   with lasix today, aiming for net I/O of neg 1-2 liters today.
   We think she is stable and well enough to go to the floor, where TTE
   should be done in the next couple of days.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]
s note above and I
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  She is doing very well
   indeed with continued hemodynamic stability and no evidence of
   continued sepsis.  Her bld cx is growing [**Last Name (STitle) 336**] and her urine cx growing
   2 sensitive species of Klebsiella. The plan is to Rx the former with
   nafcillin IV for 14 days, for which a PICC will be needed.  The latter
   organisms are and will be treated with Cipro.
   She
s gotten a lot of IVF for resuscitation over the past 3 days and is
   total body fluid overloaded.  She has mild SOB, CVP of 15, and even her
   mild increase in Creat we think may be due to her being on the
   descending limb of her cardiac Starling curve with decreased forward
   flow to her kidneys (vs some ATN from prior sepsis).  We will thus Rx
   with lasix today, aiming for net I/O of neg 1-2 liters today.
   We think she is stable and well enough to go to the floor, where TTE
   should be done in the next couple of days.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis, admitted to the ICU with septic shock. She has been treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, and pressors, and is currently hemodynamically stable. Her laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and decreased albumin and calcium levels. She has also developed acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and sepsis. Her urine culture is growing two species of Klebsiella, which are sensitive to ciprofloxacin. She has been started on nafcillin for 14 days and ciprofloxacin for 10 days.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying condition and the presence of Klebsiella in her urine and blood cultures.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased, and she is at risk of developing AKI due to her underlying condition and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk of developing hypertension-related complications, such as cardiac failure and stroke.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low, and she is at risk of developing hypocalcemia-related complications, such as muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Pustular Psoriasis Flare: The patient is at risk of developing a pustular psoriasis flare due to her underlying condition and the use of medications such as soriatane.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to her underlying condition and the presence of Klebsiella in her urine and blood cultures.
7. Renal Failure: The patient is at risk of developing renal failure due to her underlying condition and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiac failure and arrhythmias, due to her underlying condition and the use of medications such as nafcillin and ciprofloxacin."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
   This is a 64 yo female with a history of pustular psoriasis here with
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Resolved, hemodynamially stable. Currently stable
   without any pressor requirements. Upon presentation, patient met SIRS
   criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with suspected source psoriasis flare with
   superinfection.  Other possible infectious etiologies include urinary
   source.  Of note, acute generalized pustular psoriasis in it of itself
   can cause a similar presentation of acute inflammatory response.  OSH
   Bcx growing MSSA.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses / off Levophed since [**8-10**]
   - Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Changed from Vanco to Nafcillin (started [**8-12**]) for MSSA
   - Cipro (coverage since [**8-10**]) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u culture data from OSH and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Cont OSH CVL for now. Need to keep for access.
   .
   # Acute eruption of Pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, feel that
   this is more consistent with pustular psoriasis flare with
   superinfection than generalized pustular psoriasis.  Had slurred
   speech, flushing and pruritic reaction post-Soriatane. Says normal for
   her.
   - Continue  Soriatane 50. f/u with derm about soriatane side effects
   before next dose. Benadryl prn for itching.
   - Prednisone 10 mg daily (started [**8-10**])
   - Continue Clobetasol
   - Continue Morphine PRN for pain
   - Wound care per dermatology recommendations
   .
   # Staph aureus in blood: OSH BCx with MSSA.
   --Continue nafcilin
   --f/u TTE for endocarditis.
   .
   #UTI: growing 2 GNRs in urine. Pan sensitive Klebsiella from OSH
   --Follow speciation at [**Hospital1 19**].
   --On Cipro (started [**8-10**])
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely [**2-13**] ATN in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis.  Had low UOP despite boluses. Increase in Cr today
   from 1.0->1.5. Given maint IVF 200cc/hr, boluses, 1U prbc
   - Increase maintainence fluids to NS @200 cc/hr.
   - Continue to trend Cr

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who has developed septic shock. She has been diagnosed with acute pustular psoriasis with superinfection, and her blood cultures have grown MSSA. She has also been found to have urinary tract infections with two Gram-negative rods, and her urine culture has grown Klebsiella.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/76 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 91%. She has bibasilar crackles and mild expiratory wheezes on lung examination.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, with diffuse erythematous scaly plaques on her skin. She has also developed acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient has been treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain medication. She has also been prescribed prednisone for her skin condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of septic shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if she develops further complications or if her antibiotics are ineffective.
2. Development of endocarditis: The patient's OSH blood culture growing MSSA may indicate a risk of developing endocarditis.
3. Progression of acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if she develops further complications or if her antibiotics are ineffective.
4. Development of urinary tract infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may worsen if she develops further complications or if her antibiotics are ineffective.
5. Skin complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as skin necrosis or abscesses.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if she develops further complications or if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may be inadequate, leading to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate may increase if she develops further complications or if her oxygen saturation is not adequately maintained.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."
