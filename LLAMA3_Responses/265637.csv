 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who presented with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. She was started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and antibiotics, and her condition improved with diuresis and BIPAP. However, she experienced a sudden episode of tachypnea and hypoxia last night, which responded to Lasix and BIPAP.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s, and her lactate level is within normal limits. She has a fever, but it is controlled with Tylenol. Her physical examination is notable for crackles at the lung bases, and her urine output is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's episode of tachypnea and hypoxia last night could recur, and she may require further respiratory support.
2. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's flash pulmonary edema could be caused by cardiogenic factors, which need to be explored.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pyelonephritis could seed the lungs and cause a new pneumonia.
4. Congenital Heart Defects: The patient's age and symptoms could suggest congenital heart defects, which need to be evaluated.
5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's symptoms could be caused by cardiomyopathy, which needs to be ruled out.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis could worsen if not managed properly.
7. Sepsis-Induced Renal Failure: The patient's sepsis could cause renal failure, which needs to be monitored.
8. Right Renal Abscess: The patient's pyelonephritis could develop into a right renal abscess, which needs to be monitored.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and diuresis to manage pyelonephritis and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide further respiratory support if needed.
3. Evaluate the patient's cardiac status with a TTE and rule out cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema.
4. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and provide appropriate management.
5. Monitor the patient's urine output and kidney function to prevent sepsis-induced renal failure.
6. Consider repeat CT scan if the patient's condition worsens and there is concern about a right renal abscess."

 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection.  She received 8
   liters of normal saline in the emergency and antibiotic coverage with
   ciprofloxacin and flagyl.  Currently her systolic blood pressures are
   in the 90s.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Currently no foley to
   measure urine output.  Physical exam is notable for crackles at the
   lung bases.
   - place foley for closer monitoring of urine output
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - follow final read of CT scan
   - trend lactate
   - repeat urinalysis once foley placed given presence of epithilial
   cells on sample from ER
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who was admitted to the ICU with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. She developed hypotension, fever, and respiratory distress. She was started on non-invasive ventilation and received antibiotics. Her CT scan showed striated nephrogram on the right indicative of right pyelonephritis. She was given IV antibiotics and lasix to manage her pulmonary edema. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation, with a PS of 8, PEEP of 5, and FiO2 of 40%. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/48 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Right renal abscess: The patient's CT scan showed striated nephrogram on the right indicative of right pyelonephritis, which may progress to a right renal abscess.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, particularly with her underlying lung disease.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of cardiac compromise, which could worsen with the progression of her sepsis.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and decreased organ function.
5. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs, which could worsen her clinical condition.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobility and underlying risk factors may increase her risk of developing venous thromboembolism, particularly deep vein thrombosis.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient's UTI may lead to infection-related complications, such as bacteremia, sepsis, and organ failure.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to neurological complications, such as altered mental status, seizures, and stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Consider repeat CT scans to monitor the progression of the patient's pyelonephritis and potential development of a right renal abscess.
3. Adjust the patient's antibiotic therapy as needed based on the results of her urine and blood cultures.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory distress with non-invasive ventilation and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and consider echocardiography to rule out cardiac compromise.
6. Manage the patient's metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate therapy and consider sodium bicarbonate infusions if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her fluid and electrolyte therapy as needed.
8. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism.
9. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function closely and consider proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Consider neurological monitoring and consider neuroimaging studies if the patient develops altered mental status or neurological symptoms."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
 Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA
 Continue to replete.  Monitor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to acute pulmonary edema in the context of volume resuscitation and marked positive fluid balance. Doubt pulmonary edema, pneumonia. Improved following net diuresis since onset. Follow-up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. No evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation, or pulmonary embolism. Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg. [Month (only) 11] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS. Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion. Will assess cardiac function to assess for valvular disease.
4. Sepsis Syndrome: The patient's sepsis syndrome is attributed to urinary source. Continue current level of support. [Month (only) 11] require central line. Monitor for evidence of ARDS. Continue antimicrobials.
5. Pyelonephritis, Right: The patient's pyelonephritis, right, is supported by abd CT. No contrast seen beyond right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone. Would check renal US. No immediate plans for Urology. Urine culture with GNR await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has volume resuscitation. Allow net negative. Monitor UO, I/O. Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
7. Hypocalcemia, Hypophosphatemia, and Hypomagnesemia: The patient has repleted these electrolyte imbalances. Monitor.
8. Potential for ARDS: The patient is at risk for ARDS due to pulmonary edema and sepsis syndrome. Monitor for evidence of ARDS.
9. Potential for Sepsis-related Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis syndrome may lead to sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or cardiovascular instability. Monitor for evidence of organ dysfunction.
10. Potential for ICU-related Complications: The patient is in the ICU and at risk for ICU-related complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, or pressure ulcers. Monitor for evidence of these complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and address potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt pulmonary
   edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.  Improved following net
   diuresis since onset.  Follow up CXR, as pt at risk for ARDS.
   HYPOTENSION  -- improved with fluid resussitation.  Attributed to
   sepsis and hypovolemia.  No evidence or concern for other etiologies
   such as GI bleed, cardiac decompensation or pulmonary embolism.
   Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP,
   SvO2 monitoring if remains hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Continue current
   level of support.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line.  Monitor for evidence of
   ARDS.  Continue antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.
   FLUIDS
 volume resussitated.  Allow net negative.  Monitor UO, I/O.
   Monitor electrolytes during active diuresis.
   NUTRITONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA
 Repleted. Monitor.
   HYPOMAGNESEMIA

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has experienced an episode of respiratory distress, which was managed with mask ventilation, Lasix, and diuresis, resulting in good clinical improvement. The patient's right flank pain has also improved.

The patient has a history of urinary tract infection, which is likely the source of the sepsis. The patient has been receiving antimicrobial therapy, and a urine culture is pending to identify the causative organism and determine antibiotic sensitivities.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has experienced acute pulmonary edema, which was likely caused by volume resuscitation and marked positive fluid balance. The patient is at risk for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, which is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and the plan is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which is attributed to cardiogenic causes, although the possibility of ARDS cannot be ruled out. The patient's cardiac function is being assessed to evaluate for valvular disease.
4. Pyelonephritis: The patient has a diagnosis of pyelonephritis, which is supported by an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient is at risk for further complications, such as kidney stones or obstruction.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has experienced fluid overload, which is being managed with diuresis. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which are being managed with repletion therapy.
7. Nutrition: The patient is at risk for malnutrition, and enteral nutrition is being encouraged.

The patient is being treated in the ICU and is receiving close monitoring and management of their condition. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.
   - trend bicarbonate for now
   - check PM electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 PULMONARY EDEMA
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PYELONEPHRITIS
   21 year old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections
   here with pyelopephritis and severe sepsis.
   Respiratory Distress
   Patient had episode of tachypneic and hypoxia last night from flash
   pulmonary edema.  Responded to Lasix 40 mg IV x 1.  Good urine output.
   Differential for causes of the respiratory distress include volume
   overload, cardiogenic pulmonary edemak, pneumonia, congenital heart
   defects, cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary edema from volume overload is
   possible in light of low albumin, possibly because of sepsis.
   Cardiogenic causes should be explored as flash pulmonary edema in a
   relatively healthy 21 year old is very uncommon.  In light of her
   pyelonephritis, she has a source for possible bacteremia which may seed
   the lungs causing a new pneumonia.  Other considerations are congenital
   defects of the heart, genetic conditions such as HOCM, or
   cardiomyopathies.  Patient
s symptoms responded to diuresis and BIPAP
   which speak more towards pulmonary edema rather than PEs or other
   noncardiogenic causes.
   - add on albumin to today
s labs
   - TTE scheduled for today to evaluate cardiac structure and function
   Severe Sepsis/Pyelonephritits:  Patient with fevers and hypotension in
   the setting of complicated urinary tract infection, but afebrile and
   normal leukocytes today  She received 8 liters of normal saline in the
   emergency and antibiotic coverage with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
   Currently her systolic blood pressures are in the 90s.  Lactate is
   within normal limits.  Currently no foley to measure urine output.
   Physical exam is notable for crackles at the lung bases.
   - likely adequately fluid resusciated at this time, if persistent
   hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion will place central line to
   allow for levophed and measurement of CVP and ScvO2
   - target UOP > 30 cc/hr, SBP > 90
   - continue zosyn for antibiotic coverage for complicated pyelonephritis
   - follow urine and blood cultures
   - if concerns of right renal abscess developing, consider repeat CT
   scan if patient worsens clinically
   - UTI prevention counseling
   Metabolic Acidosis:  On presentation serum bicarbonate was 20 with
   anion gap of 12.  Lactate is within normal limits.  Ketones present in
   urine.  Likely related to small degree of starvation ketosis.  Venous
   blood gas on arrival to ICU with pH of 7.38.
   - trend bicarbonate for now
   - check PM electrolytes

Summary:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) who presents to the ICU with pyelonephritis and severe sepsis. She has developed respiratory distress, with flash pulmonary edema, and is being treated with diuresis and BIPAP. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99-100°F, SaO2 of 92% on 2-3L NC, and blood pressure in the 90s. She has a low-grade fever, coughing light yellow sputum, and pink-tinged. Her physical examination is notable for crackles at the lung bases, and her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory distress and pink-tinged sputum suggest the possibility of pneumonia, particularly given her history of UTIs and pyelonephritis.
2. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's flash pulmonary edema and response to diuresis and BIPAP suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema as a possible cause of her respiratory distress.
3. Sepsis-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis and pyelonephritis may lead to sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction, which could worsen her respiratory distress.
4. Right Renal Abscess: The patient's pyelonephritis and sepsis may lead to the development of a right renal abscess, which could worsen her condition.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction.
6. UTI Prevention: The patient's history of frequent UTIs and pyelonephritis suggests the need for UTI prevention measures, such as proper hygiene and antibiotics, to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis and BIPAP to manage the patient's respiratory distress.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any worsening of her condition.
3. Consider repeating a CT scan if the patient's condition worsens clinically to rule out a right renal abscess.
4. Continue antibiotics for complicated pyelonephritis and consider adding on albumin to the patient's labs.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
6. Provide UTI prevention counseling and consider adding a Foley catheter to monitor the patient's urine output."

   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt
   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F) with a current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 56-104 bpm
* Blood pressure: 103/63 mmHg with a range of 72-108/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (insp/min) with a range of 15-29 insp/min
* Oxygen saturation: 90%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress, no signs of overweight or obesity, no signs of anxiety or diaphoresis
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils are round and reactive to light), no signs of conjunctival edema or scleral edema
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse, no signs of hyperdynamic circulation
* Respiratory: Normal breath sounds, no signs of crackles, wheezes, or rhonchorous breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: trace, left lower extremity edema: trace, no signs of cyanosis or clubbing
* Skin: Warm, no signs of rash or jaundice
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, with purposeful movement and normal tone

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.5-13.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 32.4-37.9%
* Platelet count: 139-246 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 7-8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 98-127 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 13.4/33.9/1.1, Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.1 g/dL, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory distress attributed to acute pulmonary edema in the context of volume resuscitation and marked positive fluid balance. The patient is supported by radiographs and is expected to improve with follow-up chest X-ray.
* Hypotension resolved, attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. The patient's blood pressure will be monitored, and a central line will be inserted for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring if the patient remains hypotensive.
* Pulmonary edema attributed to cardiogenic and less likely ARDS. The patient's cardiac function will be assessed to rule out valvular disease.
* Sepsis syndrome attributed to urinary source. The patient's antibiotics will be continued.
* Pyelonephritis, right, supported by abdominal computed tomography (CT). The patient's urine culture will be awaited to identify the causative organism and determine antibiotic sensitivities.
* Fluids: Volume resuscitated, with a plan to allow net negative fluid balance. The patient's urine output and input will be monitored, as well as electrolytes during active diuresis.
* Nutritional support: Encouragement of oral intake.
* Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia: Repleted and monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac failure
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia
* Pyelonephritis-related complications, such as obstruction or stone formation
* Urinary tract infections
* Infective endocarditis
* Septic shock"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to acute pulmonary edema in context
   of volume resussitation, marked postive fluid balance.  Doubt
   non-cardiogneic pulmonary edema, pneumonia.  Supported by radiograph.
   Continues to improve, now spontaneously diuresing.  Follow up CXR.
   HYPOTENSION  -- Resolved.  Attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia.  No
   evidence or concern for other etiologies such as GI bleed, cardiac
   decompensation or pulmonary embolism.  Monitor BP, Maintain MAP >60
   mmHg.  [**Month (only) 11**] require central line for CVP, SvO2 monitoring if remains
   hypotensive
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to cardiogenic, less likely ARDS.
   Pulmonary edema in setting of volume repletion.  Will assess cardiac
   function to assess for valvular disease.
   SEPSIS SYNDROME -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved.  Continue
   antimicrobials.
   PYELONEPHRITIS, RIGHT -- supported by abd CT.  No contrast seen beyond
   right renal pelvis, suggesting possible obstruction such as stone -->
   would check renal US.  No immediate plans for Urology.  Urine culture
   with GNR
 await identification and antibiotic sensitivities.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of pyelonephritis, right, and pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has improved, and they are now spontaneously diuresing. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and their oxygen saturation is 90%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.5, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 139. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which have been repleted. 

The patient's medications include piperacillin, heparin sodium, and an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's lines include an 18-gauge and 20-gauge central line, and prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing antimicrobial therapy for sepsis, close monitoring of fluid balance, and continued nutritional support. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor once their condition stabilizes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Continued sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pulmonary edema, which can worsen and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Pyelonephritis, which can lead to kidney damage and chronic kidney disease.
4. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.
5. Electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
6. DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
7. VAP, which can lead to pneumonia and death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure the best possible outcome."
