   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.

   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, intubated for airway protection, and diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient's mental status is still altered, and he is being treated for infection, arrhythmia, and retention of CO2. He is also being monitored for potential complications such as stroke, seizure, and carcinomatous meningitis.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%. His hemodynamic status is also stable, with a blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 beats per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin level, which may be due to renal failure rather than myocardial infarction. His creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, and his hemoglobin level is 9.6 g/dL. His white blood cell count is 5.1 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 162 x 10^9/L.

The patient's medical plan includes treatment for aspiration pneumonia, arrhythmia, and retention of CO2. He will also undergo further evaluation for potential complications such as stroke, seizure, and carcinomatous meningitis. His code status is full code, and he is being treated with prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to his aspiration of food and liquids.
2. Arrhythmia: The patient's arrhythmia may worsen, and he may require further treatment.
3. Carcinomatous meningitis: The patient's carcinomatous meningitis may progress, and he may require further treatment.
4. Stroke: The patient is at risk for developing a stroke due to his altered mental status and potential blood clotting disorders.
5. Seizure: The patient may develop a seizure due to his altered mental status and potential electrolyte imbalances.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further treatment to prevent renal failure.
7. Bleeding: The patient may develop bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy and potential blood clotting disorders.
8. Infection: The patient may develop an infection due to his altered mental status and potential blood clotting disorders."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at 10:00 PM, which did not show improvement in their condition. The patient remains intubated and tolerates 0/5. Neurological status is being monitored with EEG, MRI, and consideration of a lumbar puncture (LP). The patient was more awake this morning. Medications include vancomycin, piperacillin, pantoprazole, naloxone, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a central venous catheter and is receiving fluid resuscitation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and invasive medical devices increase the risk of infection. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate a mild infection.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is being closely monitored, and further deterioration could occur if the underlying condition is not effectively treated.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and their partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is 280 mmHg, which may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.3, which may indicate a coagulopathy.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is 0.3 mmol/L, which may indicate metabolic acidosis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, and their magnesium level is slightly decreased, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
8. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, which may indicate renal failure.
9. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of antibiotics may indicate sepsis.
10. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated D-dimer level and presence of heparin sodium may indicate DIC."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and sedated, with no significant improvement in their condition over the past 24 hours. They are tolerating 0/5 and are more awake this morning. Despite attempts at lumbar puncture, it was unsuccessful. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg. Their respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode, with a PS of 5 cmH2O and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals an intubated and sedated individual with occasional rhonchi in the lungs and no wheezes. They have excoriations over both lower extremities and trace edema of the feet. Neurological examination shows spontaneous movement of all extremities, withdrawal to noxious stimuli, and a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 155 K/uL. Other notable laboratory results include a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.08 ng/mL, and lactate of 0.3 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is ongoing, and they require close monitoring for any signs of worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest possible sepsis, which requires prompt evaluation and management.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status has not improved over the past 24 hours, and they may be at risk for further deterioration.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is low, and they are receiving anticoagulant therapy, which increases their risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's urinary catheter and central venous lines may be at risk for infection, which requires regular monitoring and maintenance.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal examination is normal, but they may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or bleeding.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate fluid overload or inadequate fluid replacement.

These potential complications require close monitoring and management to prevent worsening of the patient's condition."

   MRI: read pending
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings.
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKSs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings.
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKSs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway protection. He has been treated for aspiration pneumonia, and his respiratory status has been stable. However, he continues to have arrhythmias, including accelerated idioventricular rhythm and PVCs. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, but his ejection fraction is normal. He has a history of renal insufficiency and is currently on hemodialysis. He has also had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma and has been experiencing hematuria.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's arrhythmias, including accelerated idioventricular rhythm and PVCs, may require further monitoring and treatment.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for aspiration pneumonia, but he may still be at risk for developing further complications, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
4. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria may require further evaluation and treatment, including a urology consult and possible intervention.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency may require further monitoring and treatment, including dialysis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation may put him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be related to his underlying medical conditions, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac arrhythmias and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
3. Continue to evaluate the patient's hematuria and consider a urology consult if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal insufficiency and adjust his dialysis regimen as needed.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's cardiovascular and neurological complications.
6. Consider a multidisciplinary approach to the patient's care, including input from cardiology, urology, and neurology specialists."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, successfully extubated yesterday.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Still remains unclear what prompted acute
   mental status change. Most likely was secondary to infection +/- COPD
   with CO2 retention. Differential at time of admission included
   infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source in setting
   of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia, seizure, retention
   of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of admission AFTER
   intubation demonstrated hypercarbia), or stroke
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens, on
   vanco/zosyn/azithromycin (day 4 of abx)
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
none noted
   - Culture data negative to date
   - Appreciate Neuro assistance
   - MRI brain: no evidence of acute stroke or lesions
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; should
   likely re-attempt to rule out leptomeningeal spread of malignancy,
   although this is less likely to account for acute change given
   improvement without significant intervention.
   - EEG did not suggest seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status, successfully extubated yesterday.
   -          Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent
   admission), added azithromycin today (today is day 4 of vanco/zosyn),
   will complete 7 day course.
   -          When patient was seen on rounds, appeared to have some
   wheezes. In conjunction with CXR, appears more of a fluid
   overloaded/pulm edema state, so will diuresis (home dose 20 mg lasix)
   with 40 mg IV lasix, change albuterol nebs to standing and PRN, and
   consider steroids if wheezing is not improved with diuresis.
   -          Checking urinary legionella antigen.
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. Old
   EKGs demonstrate this is not a new finding. He has been ruled out for
   MI.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia and diuresis today
   (and wheezing), will add back BB if BP tolerates today or tomorrow
   given history of CAD.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, currently on slower CBI without
   any hematuria.
   - Appreciate urology assistance, recommended CBI until urine clear/pink
   (with TCC resection, CBI better to help scar form and stop hematuria)
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home. Ruled out for MI.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded,
   but CXR could be consistent with CHF
   - Given CXR and wheezing this AM, giving IV lasix with goal of net out
   today.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides. Today is improved to 1.3.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Slightly down today. Will hold off on transfusion as he does
   not have significant hematuria, but transfuse if <25 or symptoms. Given
   B12 was borderline low, will check MMA. Continuing iron
   supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #) FEN: Concern for aspiration by nursing staff, requesting speech and
   swallow evalutation.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI (changing to PO given no evidence of GIB).
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, successfully extubated yesterday.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Still remains unclear what prompted acute
   mental status change. Most likely was secondary to infection +/- COPD
   with CO2 retention. Differential at time of admission included
   infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source in setting
   of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia, seizure, retention
   of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of admission AFTER
   intubation demonstrated hypercarbia), or stroke
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens, on
   vanco/zosyn/azithromycin (day 4 of abx)
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
none noted
   - Culture data negative to date
   - Appreciate Neuro assistance
   - MRI brain: no evidence of acute stroke or lesions
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; should
   likely re-attempt to rule out leptomeningeal spread of malignancy,
   although this is less likely to account for acute change given
   improvement without significant intervention.
   - EEG did not suggest seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status, successfully extubated yesterday.
   -          Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent
   admission), added azithromycin today (today is day 4 of vanco/zosyn),
   will complete 7 day course.
   -          When patient was seen on rounds, appeared to have some
   wheezes. In conjunction with CXR, appears more of a fluid
   overloaded/pulm edema state, so will diuresis (home dose 20 mg lasix)
   with 40 mg IV lasix, change albuterol nebs to standing and PRN, and
   consider steroids if wheezing is not improved with diuresis.
   -          Checking urinary legionella antigen.
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. Old
   EKGs demonstrate this is not a new finding. He has been ruled out for
   MI.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia and diuresis today
   (and wheezing), will add back BB if BP tolerates today or tomorrow
   given history of CAD.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, currently on slower CBI without
   any hematuria.
   - Appreciate urology assistance, recommended CBI until urine clear/pink
   (with TCC resection, CBI better to help scar form and stop hematuria)
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home. Ruled out for MI.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded,
   but CXR could be consistent with CHF
   - Given CXR and wheezing this AM, giving IV lasix with goal of net out
   today.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides. Today is improved to 1.3.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Slightly down today. Will hold off on transfusion as he does
   not have significant hematuria, but transfuse if <25 or symptoms. Given
   B12 was borderline low, will check MMA. Continuing iron
   supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #) FEN: Concern for aspiration by nursing staff, requesting speech and
   swallow evalutation.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI (changing to PO given no evidence of GIB).
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition appears to be stable, with some improvement in their mental status. They were extubated around 230 pm and remained on the sleepy side for the rest of the day. The preliminary EEG results were normal, and the MRI did not show any evidence of acute infarct or enhancing brain lesion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show some variability, but overall, their hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count are within normal ranges. Their creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.5 mg/dL, but their troponin-T level is normal at 0.08 ng/mL.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis and glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that may arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive sputum culture suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to their prolonged immobility and the use of anticoagulant therapy.
4. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of stress ulcer prophylaxis medications suggests that they are at risk for stress ulcer development.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases their risk for VAP.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of cardiac disease and the use of anticoagulant therapy increase their risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting their treatment plan as necessary to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.
