   Assessment and Plan
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents with UTI on [**7-18**].  He then developed fevers and hypotension
   overnight on [**7-19**] and has coag + SA in his blood cultures.  On exam, has
   new fullness of R jaw and tenderness to palpation, concerning for
   possible abscess.
   .
   # Bacteremia - has new staph aureus bacteremia, source unknown at this
   time, but concerning for facial abscess.  Hemodynamics unstable on the
   floor with hypotension but since admission to MICU have been stable.
   CT scan showed submandibular enlargement and stranding.  Has R IJ
   thrombus.  Possible Lemmiere
s syndrome.
   - ENT consult today
   - neurosurg consult for possible removal of shunts as they run through
   infected neck space
   - cont vanco
   - cont Zosyn for anaerobe and gram neg coverage from mouth flora
   - surveillance blood cultures
   .
   # RIJ thrombophlebitis
 will start heparin gtt once procedures
   completed
   .
   # Hypotension - in the setting of high grade bacteremia, responded to
   fluid boluses on the floor, continues to be mildly hypotensive on the
   floor.
   - IVFs as needed
   - monitor urine output
   - monitor respiratory status for fluid overload, stable now
   - will obtain central access for possible need of pressor support
   .
   # UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process
   from the staph aureus bacteremia
   - stopped ceftriaxone, Zosyn will cover proteus [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
   - foley changed and negative urine cx since change
   - does not have indwelling foley, once stabalized, consider d/c'ing
   foley and using home diapers
   .
   # Cough/SOB - CXR without evidence of pneumonia, no obvious source.
   Patient passed a speech and swallow.
   - has risk of septic pulmonary embolic
   - heparin and abx as above
   - otherwise no obvious source for cough at this time, no hypoxic
   .
   # Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, would need to consider seeding, no
   evidence of altered mental status at this time, though.
   - head CT without change from last year
   - would need to consider lumbar puncture or shunt tap if the suspected
   source of bacteremia is negative
   - f/u neurosurg recs
   .
   # Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   # Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who presents with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and later develops fevers, hypotension, and bacteremia. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: 101.2°F
* Hypotension: Blood pressure in the 80s/50s range
* Bacteremia: Staphylococcus aureus, source unknown
* Facial abscess: Possible abscess in the right jaw, concerning for Lemierre's syndrome
* RIJ thrombophlebitis: Thrombus in the right internal jugular vein
* UTI: Pan-proteus UTI, likely a separate process from the staph aureus bacteremia
* Cough/SOB: No obvious source, risk of septic pulmonary embolism
* Hydrocephalus: Known hydrocephalus with a non-working shunt, potential seeding of bacteria
* Seizures: Stable, last seizure one year ago
* Contractures: Stable, need to keep left arm restrained
* FEN: NPO for now, passed speech and swallow, can have regular diet when hemodynamically stable

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock due to bacteremia
* Pulmonary embolism due to septic pulmonary embolism
* Lemierre's syndrome due to facial abscess
* Seeding of bacteria in the shunt, potentially leading to meningitis or abscess
* Contracture progression due to immobility
* Malnutrition due to NPO status
* Hypoglycemia due to glycemic control issues

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition, including:

* Antibiotics for bacteremia and UTI
* Fluid management for hypotension
* Monitoring of respiratory status for fluid overload
* Surveillance blood cultures
* Neurosurgical consult for possible removal of shunts
* ENT consult for possible abscess drainage
* Heparin therapy for RIJ thrombophlebitis
* Close monitoring of seizures and contractures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypotension and bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 87 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 91/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient has a history of:

* Encephalomalacia and parenchymal atrophy on head CT
* Suggestive findings of right internal jugular (RIJ) thrombosis on neck CT
* Fever and bacteremia, treated with zosyn

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.0%
* Platelet count: 358
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 102 mg/dL
* Other labs show elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical condition, and no specific findings are noted.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to bacteremia
* Thrombosis and thrombophlebitis of the RIJ, which may lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis
* Hypotension and cardiovascular instability
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation
* Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis
* Liver and kidney dysfunction due to elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Antibiotic therapy for bacteremia
* Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Administration of IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
* Respiratory support with oxygen therapy
* Monitoring of glucose levels and insulin therapy as needed
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention
* Nutritional support with enteral feeding"

   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents with UTI on [**7-18**].  He then developed fevers and hypotension
   overnight on [**7-19**] and has coag + SA in his blood cultures.  On exam, has
   new fullness of R jaw and tenderness to palpation, concerning for
   possible abscess.
   .
   # Bacteremia - has new staph aureus bacteremia, source unknown at this
   time, but concerning for facial abscess.  Hemodynamics unstable on the
   floor with hypotension but since admission to MICU have been stable.

   - consider CVL if needed later tonight
   - echo in the AM to rule out endocarditis
   .
   # Hypotension - in the setting of high grade bacteremia, responded to
   fluid boluses on the floor.
   - IVFs as needed
   - monitor urine output
   - trend lactates if worrisome, normal this afternoon; elevated on
   admission
   - monitor respiratory status for fluid overload, stable now
   .
   # UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process
   from the staph aureus bacteremia
   - cont ceftriaxone for 7 day complicated UTI course, day [**2-20**]
   - foley changed and negative urine cx since change
   - does not have indwelling foley, once stabalized, consider d/c'ing
   foley and using home diapers

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of bacteremia, sepsis, and possible abscess.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.2°F, blood pressure 91/60 mmHg, heart rate 87 beats per minute, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure has been trending down, and he has been responding to fluid boluses.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 3,240 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with a balance of 570 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin is 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count is 358 K/uL. His blood cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus, and he has a new fullness of the right jaw and tenderness to palpation, concerning for possible abscess.
* Imaging studies: A head CT scan showed no significant change from the previous scan, with enlargement of the whole ventricular system, fragment of shunts, encephalomalacia, and parenchymal atrophy. A neck CT scan showed findings suggestive of likely right internal jugular thrombosis, with vein wall enhancement and peri-venous inflammation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Abscess: The patient's new fullness of the right jaw and tenderness to palpation are concerning for possible abscess, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory distress, sepsis, and death.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's right internal jugular thrombosis can lead to further complications such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and cerebral thrombosis.
4. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia can lead to endocarditis, which can cause further complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death.
5. Hydrocephalus: The patient's known hydrocephalus and shunt can lead to further complications such as shunt failure, hydrocephalus, and cerebral edema.
6. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures can lead to further complications such as status epilepticus, which can cause respiratory and cardiac arrest.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and hemodynamic instability, and has been diagnosed with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 101.2°F, T-current 98.9°F, HR 87 bpm, BP 91/60 mmHg, RR 19 breaths/min, SpO2 99%.
* Physical examination: The patient is chronically ill appearing, with new fullness of the right jaw and tenderness to palpation, concerning for possible abscess.
* Laboratory results: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine levels, and decreased albumin and hemoglobin levels.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia, which is concerning for facial abscess and possible endocarditis.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has responded to fluid boluses.
3. UTI: The patient has a pan- Proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from the staph aureus bacteremia.
4. Hydrocephalus: The patient has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt.
5. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, which are currently stable.
6. Contractures: The patient has contractures in the upper extremities, which are stable.
7. FEN (Feeding): The patient is NPO for now, with plans to resume regular diet when hemodynamically stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Facial abscess: The patient's new fullness of the right jaw and tenderness to palpation are concerning for possible abscess.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia and shunt in place increase the risk of endocarditis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated lactate levels increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and possible abscess increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's bacteremia and elevated lactate levels increase the risk of cardiac arrest.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Trend fever curve
2. Add diff on to labs
3. Continue vancomycin for staph coverage
4. CT neck with contrast
5. ENT consult if abscess
6. IVFs as needed for hypotension, tachycardia
7. Monitor urine output
8. Trend lactates if worrisome, normal this afternoon; elevated on admission
9. Monitor respiratory status for fluid overload, stable now
10. Continue ceftriaxone for 7-day complicated UTI course
11. Foley changed and negative urine cx since change
12. Consider d/c'ing foley and using home diapers once stable
13. Continue to monitor for airway compromise in setting of possible abscess
14. Continue to monitor continuous O2 sat

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), persistently vegetative state, and a recent diagnosis of sepsis. He has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to severe hypotension and positive blood cultures.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Fever (38.4°C) and tachycardia (95 bpm)
2. Mild hypotension (BP: 98/56 mmHg) responsive to fluids
3. Respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygenation
4. Abnormal laboratory results, including:
	* Elevated white blood cell count (10.3 K/uL)
	* Decreased platelet count (311 K/uL)
	* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (168 IU/L)
	* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT: 24 IU/L, AST: 20 IU/L)
	* Elevated creatinine (0.5 mg/dL)
5. Imaging studies, including:
	* Head CT: unchanged
	* Chest X-ray: right lower lobe opacity, stable
	* Neck CT: possible right internal jugular thrombus and neck collection
6. Microbiology results, including:
	* Positive blood culture for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (BCX)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continuation of vancomycin and consideration of adding Zosyn for presumed polymicrobial infection
2. Anticoagulation therapy
3. Neurosurgery and ENT consult for further evaluation and management
4. Consideration of PE-pretocol CT for septic emboli
5. ID consult for antibiotic choice and duration of therapy
6. Seizure prophylaxis with Keppra
7. Temporary femoral tunnel for access
8. ICU care, including glycemic control, nutrition, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, respiratory failure)
2. Thrombophlebitis and septic emboli
3. Bacteremia and sepsis
4. Neurological deterioration
5. Respiratory failure
6. Cardiovascular instability
7. Gastrointestinal complications (e.g., bowel obstruction, perforation)
8. Wound complications (e.g., infection, dehiscence)
9. Nutritional deficiencies
10. Psychological and emotional distress for the patient and family

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the management plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of TBI, presenting with sepsis, UTI, and suspected suppurative thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for presumed polymicrobial infection. The patient has a history of seizures and is being monitored for seizure activity. He is also being treated for a UTI and has a Foley catheter in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/56 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a nasal cannula in place. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies show a right-sided neck collection and possible R IJ thrombus.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Suppurative thrombophlebitis: The patient's suspected suppurative thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein can lead to septic emboli and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. UTI-related complications: The patient's UTI can lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and other complications if not properly treated.
4. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizures and current treatment with keppra can lead to seizure activity, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but can deteriorate if not properly monitored and treated.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but can fluctuate if not properly managed, leading to cardiovascular instability.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated lactate levels and potential UTI-related complications can lead to renal failure if not properly managed.
8. Infection-related complications: The patient's polymicrobial infection can lead to infection-related complications, including sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death."

   Septic thrombophlebitis, right submandibular space infection
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-7-21**].
   - ID consulted.  They recommended narrowing coverated to Zosyn alone as
   it covers gram negative, anaerobes and has good MSSA coverage.  They
   agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg.  They are recommending
   consideration of TEE.
   - ENT consulted; recommended sour candy/[**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate
   submandibular secretions and to monitor for neck fullness
   - Neurosurg consulted;  They will remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt
   on Friday after talking to the family.
   - Femoral line placed
   - Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming
   febrile.  He was given 3LNS and then started on Levophed.  An a-line
   was also placed.  Remains on Levophed 0.08.
   - Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in
   setting of hypotension.
   - Radiology confirmed that one shunt is a V-P shunt and the other shunt
   is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ
   - Per family, patient had a shunt placed in [**2091**] due to seizure
   activity.  He had no improvement with the first shunt, so a second was
   place, and seizures resolved.  Will need to obtain these records from
   [**Hospital 927**] [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State **]
   - more episodes of sinus bradycardia to 50s overnight while sleeping;
   vagal tone while sleeping +/- neck pressure from neck swelling
   - worsening neck swelling --> CT scan versus ENT eval in AM?

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with septic thrombophlebitis and a right submandibular space infection. He has a history of seizures and had two shunts placed, with the second shunt resolving his seizures. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a fever, hypotension, and bradycardia. He has a swollen jaw and increased right jaw swelling. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic thrombophlebitis and right submandibular space infection may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be indicative of septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and elevated lactate levels may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac tamponade.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of seizures and current encephalopathy may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or cerebral edema.
6. Infectious Complications: The patient's septic thrombophlebitis and right submandibular space infection may lead to further infectious complications, such as bacteremia or meningitis.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's inability to provide a history due to sedation and encephalopathy may lead to nutritional complications, such as malnutrition or dehydration.
8. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may indicate hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Administer antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of sepsis or septic shock.
3. Manage the patient's respiratory status and ventilator settings as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, to evaluate the patient's neurological and cardiovascular status.
7. Consider consulting with a neurosurgeon to evaluate the patient's shunts and potential complications.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to develop a plan for the patient's nutritional needs.
10. Continuously reassess the patient's treatment plan and adjust as necessary to ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph
   bacteremia.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - f/u RUE ultrasound to confirm presence of occlusive thrombus
   - consider CTA to look for septic pulmonary emboli if develops
   respiratory symptoms
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the
   studies
   .
   # Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg more urgent removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   # UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process
   from the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   # Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, would need to consider seeding, no
   evidence of altered mental status at this time, though.
   - head CT without change from last year
   - would need to consider lumbar puncture or shunt tap if the suspected
   source of bacteremia is negative
   - f/u neurosurg recs
   .
   # Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   # Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now, has passed speech and swallow and can have regular
   diet when he proves to be hemodynamically stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures, who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has now developed septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular (IJ) vein and an adjacent submandibular space infection. He has a Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ, which is suspected to be infected given the presence of staph aureus bacteremia. The patient has significant right jaw swelling, worsening over the past 36 hours, with no drainable fluid collection and an intact airway.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Septic shock: likely caused by the infected V-A shunt and adjacent submandibular infection.
2. UTI: with a pan-proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from the staph aureus bacteremia.
3. Hydrocephalus: with a known shunt that was last imaged a year ago, showing a non-working shunt.
4. Seizures: stable, last seizure one year ago.
5. Contractures: stable, with contractures of the feet bilaterally.
6. FEN (feeding): NPO for now, with plans to start a regular diet when hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications:

1. Airway compromise: due to worsening tongue swelling and potential for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: given the presence of staph aureus bacteremia and suspected infection of the V-A shunt.
3. Septic pulmonary emboli: given the presence of staph aureus bacteremia and potential for septic thrombophlebitis.
4. Worsening of hydrocephalus: given the presence of staph aureus bacteremia and potential for shunt infection.
5. Neurological complications: given the presence of staph aureus bacteremia and potential for meningitis or encephalitis.

Plan:

1. Continue Zosyn for MSSA coverage and coverage of oral GNRs and anaerobes.
2. Serial clinical exams to monitor for signs of airway compromise and worsening of jaw swelling.
3. Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock.
4. ID following to monitor for bacterial growth and potential for antibiotic resistance.
5. Awaiting removal of V-A shunt, which is presumed to be infected given the presence of staph aureus bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic thrombophlebitis.
6. Heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus.
7. F/U RUE ultrasound to confirm presence of occlusive thrombus.
8. Consider CTA to look for septic pulmonary emboli if develops respiratory symptoms.
9. Continue Levophed and IVF boluses to wean pressors.
10. Discuss with neurosurg more urgent removal of V-A shunt given worsening of clinical status."

   Septic thrombophlebitis, right submandibular space infection
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-7-21**].
   - ID consulted.  They recommended narrowing coverated to Zosyn alone as
   it covers gram negative, anaerobes and has good MSSA coverage.  They
   agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg.  They are recommending
   consideration of TEE.
   - ENT consulted; recommended sour candy/[**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate
   submandibular secretions and to monitor for neck fullness
   - Neurosurg consulted;  They will remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt
   on Friday after talking to the family.
   - Femoral line placed
   - Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming
   febrile.  He was given 3LNS and then started on Levophed.  An a-line
   was also placed.  Remains on Levophed 0.08.
   - Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in
   setting of hypotension.
   - Radiology confirmed that one shunt is a V-P shunt and the other shunt
   is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ
   - Per family, patient had a shunt placed in [**2091**] due to seizure
   activity.  He had no improvement with the first shunt, so a second was
   place, and seizures resolved.  Will need to obtain these records from
   [**Hospital 927**] [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State **]
   - more episodes of sinus bradycardia to 50s overnight while sleeping;
   vagal tone while sleeping +/- neck pressure from neck swelling
   - worsening neck swelling --> CT scan versus ENT eval in AM?

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-7-21**].
   - ID consulted.  They recommended narrowing coverated to Zosyn alone as
   it covers gram negative, anaerobes and has good MSSA coverage.  They
   agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg.  They are recommending
   consideration of TEE.
   - ENT consulted; recommended sour candy/[**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate
   submandibular secretions and to monitor for neck fullness
   - Neurosurg consulted;  They will remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt
   on Friday after talking to the family.
   - Femoral line placed
   - Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming
   febrile.  He was given 3LNS and then started on Levophed.  An a-line
   was also placed.  Remains on Levophed 0.08.
   - Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in
   setting of hypotension.
   - Radiology confirmed that one shunt is a V-P shunt and the other shunt
   is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ
   - Per family, patient had a shunt placed in [**2091**] due to seizure
   activity.  He had no improvement with the first shunt, so a second was
   place, and seizures resolved.  Will need to obtain these records from
   [**Hospital 927**] [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State **]
   - more episodes of sinus bradycardia to 50s overnight while sleeping;
   vagal tone while sleeping +/- neck pressure from neck swelling
   - worsening neck swelling --> CT scan versus ENT eval in AM?
   - WBC trending upward

   Assessment and Plan
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph
   bacteremia.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - f/u RUE ultrasound to confirm presence of occlusive thrombus
   - consider CT chest to look for septic pulmonary emboli if develops
   respiratory symptoms
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the
   studies
   - will discuss with ENT re: direct visualization of the airway given
   worsening clinical exam
   .
   Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg more urgent removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from
   the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.
   - discuss with neurosurg re: removal of hardware
   .
   Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has developed septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular (IJ) vein associated with a Ventricular-Atrial shunt. He has also developed a submandibular infection and has high-grade Staph aureus bacteremia. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 36 hours, with worsening right jaw swelling and signs of airway compromise.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.4°C (101.2°F)
* Heart rate: 84 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 120/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.0%
* Platelet count: 358 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* LDH: 182 IU/L

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Swollen jaw
* Increased right jaw swelling
* Contractures of the feet bilaterally
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Normal bowel sounds

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient's worsening right jaw swelling and signs of airway compromise put him at risk of airway obstruction, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic thrombophlebitis and submandibular infection, combined with his high-grade Staph aureus bacteremia, put him at risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ failure.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's Ventricular-Atrial shunt and infected V-A shunt in the right IJ vein put him at risk of developing endocarditis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and hydrocephalus put him at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or cerebral edema.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory rate and oxygen saturation put him at risk of developing respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's septic shock and hypotension put him at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
7. Renal failure: The patient's high-grade Staph aureus bacteremia and septic shock put him at risk of developing renal failure.
8. Multi-organ failure: The patient's septic shock, septic thrombophlebitis, and submandibular infection put him at risk of developing multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   Septic thrombophlebitis, right submandibular space infection
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-7-21**].
   - ID consulted.  They recommended narrowing coverated to Zosyn alone as
   it covers gram negative, anaerobes and has good MSSA coverage.  They
   agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg.  They are recommending
   consideration of TEE.
   - ENT consulted; recommended sour candy/[**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate
   submandibular secretions and to monitor for neck fullness
   - Neurosurg consulted;  They will remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt
   on Friday after talking to the family.
   - Femoral line placed
   - Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming
   febrile.  He was given 3LNS and then started on Levophed.  An a-line
   was also placed.  Remains on Levophed 0.08.
   - Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in
   setting of hypotension.
   - Radiology confirmed that one shunt is a V-P shunt and the other shunt
   is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ
   - Per family, patient had a shunt placed in [**2091**] due to seizure
   activity.  He had no improvement with the first shunt, so a second was
   place, and seizures resolved.  Will need to obtain these records from
   [**Hospital 927**] [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State **]
   - more episodes of sinus bradycardia to 50s overnight while sleeping;
   vagal tone while sleeping +/- neck pressure from neck swelling
   - worsening neck swelling --> CT scan versus ENT eval in AM?
   - WBC trending upward

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and subsequently developed septicemia, hypotension, and submandibular space infection. He has a ventricular-atrial shunt and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, both of which run through the right internal jugular vein.

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

1. Septicemia: He has a new staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and the source is unknown. He has a risk of developing septic pulmonary embolism.
2. Submandibular space infection: He has a submandibular abscess, which is causing swelling and tenderness in the right jaw.
3. Hypotension: He has been hypotensive, requiring fluid boluses and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
4. UTI: He has a pan-proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from the staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
5. Hydrocephalus: He has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last imaged one year ago, showing a non-working shunt.
6. Seizures: He has a history of seizures, but has been stable for one year.
7. Contractures: He has contractures in his feet and needs to keep his left arm restrained to prevent biting.
8. Gastrointestinal (GI) issues: He is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now and has passed a speech and swallow test.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and bacteremia put him at risk for developing septic shock.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's risk of septic pulmonary embolism is high due to his bacteremia and immobility.
3. Abscess formation: The patient's submandibular space infection can lead to abscess formation, which can be life-threatening.
4. Shunt failure: The patient's shunts may fail, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Seizure recurrence: The patient's history of seizures and current bacteremia put him at risk for seizure recurrence.
6. Contracture worsening: The patient's contractures can worsen if he is not kept mobile and active.
7. GI complications: The patient's GI issues can lead to complications such as constipation, diarrhea, or bowel obstruction.

The plan of care includes:

1. Continuation of antibiotics for staphylococcus aureus and pan-proteus UTI.
2. Heparin therapy to prevent thrombosis.
3. Surveillance blood cultures to monitor for bacteremia.
4. CT scan of the head to evaluate for abscess or shunt failure.
5. Neurosurgical consultation to consider removal of shunts.
6. ENT consultation to evaluate for abscess or facial swelling.
7. Regular insulin sliding scale to manage blood glucose levels.
8. Monitoring of urine output and respiratory status for fluid overload.
9. Consideration of central access for possible need of pressor support.
10. Holding of baclofen if hypotensive.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU overnight."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), several shunts, and presents with right internal jugular (RIJ) thrombophlebitis and sepsis caused by Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

The patient's condition has been complicated by recurrent fever and hypotension overnight, which is concerning for ongoing sepsis, likely due to a foreign object. The patient is currently receiving zosyn, norepinephrine, and heparin, and is awaiting removal of the VA shunt by neurosurgery.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.4°C (101.2°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 117/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress, thin
* Eyes/Conjunctiva: Pupils dilated, unequal, minimally reactive
* Neck: Swelling progressing
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Respiratory/Chest: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds, shallow breaths
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender
* Extremities: Right: Trace, Left: Trace
* Neurologic: No attentive, no follows simple commands, responds to painful stimuli, no oriented, no movement, no tone

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3-12.0 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 31.3-33.0%
* Platelet count: 358-393 K/uL
* Blood cultures: Positive for MSSA
* Other labs: Elevated lactate, alkaline phosphatase, and liver enzymes

Imaging studies show:

* Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): No comment on catheter
* Ultrasound: Pending

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Ongoing sepsis and septic shock
2. Complications from RIJ thrombophlebitis, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis
3. Neurological deterioration due to TBI and shunt malfunction
4. Respiratory failure due to shallow breathing and possible pneumonia
5. Cardiac complications due to hypotension and potential cardiac tamponade
6. Infections related to foreign objects, such as central lines and catheters
7. Gastrointestinal complications due to prolonged NPO status and possible stress ulceration
8. Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances due to ongoing sepsis and possible liver dysfunction

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies, and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple shunts, who presented with right internal jugular (RIJ) thrombophlebitis and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. He has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress, and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's condition is concerning for ongoing sepsis and septic shock, likely related to a foreign object. The plan is to continue antibiotics, monitor vital signs, and await source control surgery to remove the VA shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ongoing Sepsis and Septic Shock: The patient's fever and hypotension suggest ongoing sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's TBI and encephalopathy may lead to neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, or seizures.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and potential septic shock may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or myocardial infarction.
5. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's MSSA bacteremia may lead to infection-related complications such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis if not managed effectively.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the context of a bleeding diathesis.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's NPO status may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly if not managed promptly and effectively.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's NPO status and potential septic shock may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
9. Skin and Soft Tissue Complications: The patient's MSSA bacteremia may lead to skin and soft tissue complications such as cellulitis, abscesses, or necrotizing fasciitis if not managed effectively.
10. Endocrine Complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to endocrine complications such as adrenal insufficiency, thyroid dysfunction, or diabetes insipidus if not managed promptly and effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures, admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI), submandibular infection, and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular (IJ) vein. He has a ventricular-atrial (V-A) shunt that runs through the IJ, which is infected with high-grade staph aureus bacteremia. The patient has significant right jaw swelling, worsening over 36 hours, with no drainable fluid collection and an intact airway. He has a proteus UTI, likely a separate process from the staph aureus bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: The patient's tongue swelling is progressing, and there is a risk of airway compromise.
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic thrombophlebitis, submandibular infection, and staph aureus bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Endocarditis: The infected V-A shunt increases the risk of endocarditis.
4. Hardware infection: The shunt is likely infected, and there is concern for hardware infection.
5. UTI: The patient has a proteus UTI, which may not be fully treated with the current antibiotic regimen.
6. Septic shock: The patient's clinical status is worsening, and there is a risk of developing septic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk of developing neurological complications due to the infected shunt and sepsis.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening airway swelling and potential for airway compromise increase the risk of respiratory failure.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's sepsis and potential endocarditis increase the risk of cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and anaerobes.
2. Monitor for signs of airway compromise and consider direct visualization of the airway if worsening clinical exam.
3. Discuss with neurosurg/vasc re: removal of V-A shunt given worsening of clinical status.
4. Continue IVF boluses to wean pressors and levophed.
5. Consider panorex/dental c/s to evaluate for odontogenic disease/infection.
6. Discuss with ID re: repeat culture and antibiotic regimen.
7. Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock.
8. Consider echocardiogram to evaluate for endocarditis.
9. Discuss with neurosurg re: removal of hardware and potential neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures, who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and now presents with submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ) associated with a ventricular-atrial shunt.

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with worsening right jaw swelling and increasing facial edema. The patient has a high-grade Staph aureus bacteremia, and the source of infection is likely the infected ventricular-atrial shunt in the right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Septic thrombophlebitis of the right IJ with a high-grade Staph aureus bacteremia, which may lead to septic pulmonary emboli and airway compromise.
2. Submandibular infection with adjacent swelling and potential airway compromise.
3. UTI caused by Proteus, which is likely a separate process from the Staph aureus bacteremia.
4. Hydrocephalus with a non-working shunt, which may lead to hardware infection.
5. Seizures, which are stable at present but may worsen with infection.
6. Contractures of the feet, which may require physical therapy and orthotics.
7. Potential airway compromise due to swelling and inflammation in the submandibular space.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued administration of Zosyn to cover MSSA and oral anaerobes and GNS.
2. Serial clinical exams to monitor for signs of airway compromise and worsening of jaw swelling.
3. Heparin drip for the right IJ thrombus.
4. Follow-up RUE ultrasound to confirm the presence of occlusive thrombus.
5. Consideration of CT chest to look for septic pulmonary emboli if respiratory symptoms develop.
6. Deferral of panorex given the patient's inability to participate in the studies.
7. Discussion with ENT regarding direct visualization of the airway given the worsening clinical exam.
8. Urgent removal of the ventricular-atrial shunt given the worsening of the patient's clinical status.
9. Continued IVF boluses to wean pressors and levophed.
10. Discussion with neurosurg regarding removal of hardware due to concern for hardware infection.

The patient's disposition is ICU overnight, and the code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has been diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome, a thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein, and is at risk of developing septic shock. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa-based medications and has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and nafcillin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 162/150 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter and arterial line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels. The patient's coagulation studies are abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 116.7 seconds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to the presence of bacteremia and thrombophlebitis.
2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a central venous catheter in place, which increases the risk of VTE.
3. Central nervous system (CNS) complications: The patient has a shunt in place, which increases the risk of CNS complications, such as infection or hemorrhage.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving vasopressors, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
6. Infection: The patient has a central line and arterial line in place, which increases the risk of infection.
7. Hemorrhage: The patient has a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of hemorrhage.
8. Renal failure: The patient has a history of hypertension and is receiving vasopressors, which increases the risk of renal failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's condition is unstable, and there is a high risk of developing complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has now developed submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the Right Internal Jugular (RIJ) vein associated with a Ventricular-Atrial (V-A) shunt that runs through the RIJ with high-grade Staph aureus bacteremia.

The patient has significant right jaw swelling with RIJ thrombophlebitis and an adjacent submandibular space infection. He has worsening jaw swelling over the course of 36 hours, and his tongue swelling is progressing. The patient has a high-grade staph aureus bacteremia, and his blood cultures are positive.

The patient has a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures, and he is currently receiving treatment for his UTI, septic thrombophlebitis, and staph aureus bacteremia. He is also being treated for his seizures with Keppra, and he is receiving baclofen for his contractures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway Compromise: The patient's tongue swelling is progressing, and there is a risk of airway compromise if not monitored closely.
2. Septic Shock: The patient has a high-grade staph aureus bacteremia, and there is a risk of septic shock if not treated promptly and aggressively.
3. Hardware Infection: The patient's V-A shunt is likely infected, and there is a risk of hardware infection if not removed promptly.
4. Thrombosis: The patient has a RIJ thrombus, and there is a risk of thrombosis if not treated with anticoagulation therapy.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening clinical status and respiratory symptoms may lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's bacteremia and septic shock may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's seizures and worsening clinical status may lead to neurological complications such as cerebral edema or herniation.
8. Infection of the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt: The patient's V-A shunt is likely infected, and there is a risk of infection spreading to other parts of the body if not treated promptly.
9. Osteomyelitis: The patient's submandibular infection may lead to osteomyelitis if not treated promptly.
10. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and septic thrombophlebitis may lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue treatment for the patient's UTI, septic thrombophlebitis, and staph aureus bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's airway closely and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Consider removing the V-A shunt to prevent hardware infection and to treat the septic thrombophlebitis.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Consider intubation if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and provide treatment for any cardiovascular complications that arise.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide treatment for any neurological complications that arise.
9. Consider surgical drainage of the submandibular infection to prevent osteomyelitis.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall clinical status and provide treatment for any complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Peripheral vascular: Right DP pulse not assessed, left DP pulse not assessed
* Respiratory/Chest: Clear breath sounds, shallow breaths
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right: Trace, left: Trace
* Musculoskeletal: Muscle wasting, unable to stand
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Not attentive, not follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, not oriented, no movement or tone assessed

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3-12.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.1-9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 343-393 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25-28.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 102-127 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* LDH: 182 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL

Imaging studies reveal:

* Suboptimal enhancement of pulmonary arteries, no evidence of pulmonary emboli
* Known thrombosis of the right IJ vein, no extension into the brachiocephalic vein
* Bibasal atelectasis
* Tracheal bronchus supplementing the right upper lobe apical segment
* Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics (Zosyn) with ID following
* Continuing heparin gtt for now
* Goal to titrate to off pressors, MAP goal > 60
* Access: NGT for nutrition, PO meds
* Continuing Keppra
* ICU care: Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further progression of septic shock
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Development of acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Failure to control the source of infection
* Development of secondary infections (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection)
* Failure to wean from pressors
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding
* Development of neurologic complications (e.g., seizures, brain edema)

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to address these potential complications and ensure optimal management of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, and suppurative thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular (IJ) vein. He developed polymicrobial bacteremia and septic shock, requiring multiple antibiotics and vasopressors. The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing discussions about surgical procedures to remove the VA shunt and treat the suppurative thrombophlebitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Infection progression: The polymicrobial bacteremia may lead to further infection progression, including endocarditis, meningitis, or abscesses.
3. Thrombotic complications: The suppurative thrombophlebitis may lead to further thrombotic complications, including pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
4. Neurological complications: The TBI may lead to neurological complications, including increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, or seizures.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The septic shock may lead to cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, or bowel obstruction.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to respiratory complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
8. Renal complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to renal complications, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications early and initiate prompt interventions to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Septic Shock: The patient has septic shock due to the infected Ventricular-Atrial shunt and adjacent submandibular infection, which is likely to worsen if not properly managed.
2. Airway Compromise: The patient's airway is at risk due to swelling in the tongue and neck, which can lead to respiratory failure if not addressed promptly.
3. Infection of the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt: The presence of staph aureus bacteremia and the infected shunt increases the risk of further infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. UTI: The patient has a Proteus UTI, which may not be adequately covered by the current antibiotic regimen, and may lead to further complications.
5. Hydrocephalus: The patient has known hydrocephalus and a non-working shunt, which increases the risk of further complications if not addressed.
6. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on keppra, but the risk of further seizures remains due to the underlying medical conditions.
7. Contractures: The patient has contractures of the feet bilaterally, which can worsen if not managed properly.
8. Restraints: The patient requires restraints to manage aggressive behavior, which can lead to further complications if not used properly.
9. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is at risk due to the inability to tolerate oral intake and the need for IV nutrition.
10. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as constipation and bowel obstruction due to the prolonged use of bowel regimens.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the ICU team, including:

* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Aggressive management of septic shock and airway compromise
* Prompt removal of the infected Ventricular-Arial shunt
* Adequate coverage of UTI and other infections
* Management of hydrocephalus and seizures
* Proper management of contractures and restraints
* Nutritional support and gastrointestinal care
* Close communication with the patient's family and caregivers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a complex medical history, including traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He is currently admitted to the ICU with Lemierre's disease, which is a severe form of Ludwig's angina caused by an infection of the neck and throat.

The patient's condition has improved over the past 24 hours, with a trending downward fever curve and weaning off pressors. He has been treated medically rather than surgically, and the ID team has added vancomycin to cover coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Septic shock: The patient's source of infection is likely the infected Ventricular-Atrial shunt in his right internal jugular vein and adjacent submandibular infection. He has developed staph aureus bacteremia and CoNS bacteremia, which can lead to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on a ventilator for an extended period, which increases his risk of developing VAP. His chest X-ray shows bilateral consolidation, which may be indicative of pneumonia.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from his staph aureus bacteremia. He has been treated with Zosyn, but repeat cultures have been negative.
4. Hydrocephalus: The patient has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last imaged showing a non-working shunt. In the setting of new bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.
5. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently taking Keppra. He has been seizure-free for over a year, but the risk of seizure recurrence is still present.
6. Contractures: The patient has contractures of his feet bilaterally, which can lead to skin breakdown and other complications if not properly managed.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a nasogastric tube (NGT), but his nutritional status is not optimal.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, Zosyn, enoxaparin, and heparin. He is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and has a prophylactic anticoagulation regimen in place.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to be transferred to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures who was admitted with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and later developed a submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular (IJ) vein associated with a Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Septic thrombophlebitis/submandibular infection: The patient has significant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an adjacent submandibular space infection. The infection is likely caused by high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
2. Septic shock: The patient is in septic shock, and the source of infection is likely the infected V-A shunt in the right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.
3. UTI: The patient has a Proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from the Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
4. Hydrocephalus: The patient has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last imaged showing a non-working shunt. There is concern for hardware infection due to the new bacteremia and foreign body.
5. Contractures: The patient has stable contractures, but there is a need to keep the left arm restrained due to the patient's habit of biting on it.
6. FEN (Fever, Endotracheal Nutrition): The patient is NPO for now due to neck/airway swelling, but has passed speech and swallow and can have a regular diet when hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Airway compromise: The patient's worsening tongue swelling and airway compromise pose a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and bacteremia can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Infection of the V-A shunt: The infected shunt can lead to further complications, including hardware infection and meningitis.
4. UTI progression: The patient's Proteus UTI can progress to a more severe infection, including pyelonephritis or sepsis.
5. Contracture progression: The patient's contractures can worsen, leading to further mobility limitations and potential pressure ulcers.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and potential need for further surgery or medical interventions can lead to malnutrition and related complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: Continue Zosyn to cover MSSA, coag-neg staph, and oral anaerobes and GNS.
2. Fluid management: Continue IVF boluses to wean pressors.
3. Hemodynamic monitoring: Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Surgical intervention: Discuss with neurosurg/vasc re: removal of V-A shunt given worsening clinical status.
5. Airway management: Monitor for signs of airway compromise and consider direct visualization of the airway if worsening clinical exam.
6. Nutrition: Continue repletion with fiber and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), ventriculoperitoneal (VP) and ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, who presented with septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient is currently improving on medical management without surgical intervention.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 110 bpm (normal range: 76-114 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/79 mmHg (normal range: 94-145/65-132 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-25 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.3-12.0 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.3-10.0 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count (Plt): 358-393 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.5-0.6 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood glucose: 89-127 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: No acute distress, thin
* Eyes and conjunctiva: Pupils unequal, stable
* Head, ears, nose, and throat: Normocephalic, NG tube, neck improved
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse present, left radial pulse present
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left radial pulses absent
* Musculoskeletal: Muscle wasting, unable to stand
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds to pain

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continuation of antibiotics, including vancomycin, awaiting sensitivity results
* No surgical intervention
* Continued use of lovenox indefinitely, possible transition to coumadin if reliable oral access
* Management of hypotension with fluid boluses as needed
* Monitoring of AST elevation and potential need for CK-MB testing
* Use of nasogastric tube for dysphagia
* Reassessment of swallow function when transferred to the floor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), ventriculoperitoneal (VP) and ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, who presented with septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient's condition has improved without surgical intervention.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/79 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving lovenox and vancomycin infusions, and has been switched from piperacillin/tazobactam to vancomycin.

The patient's physical examination reveals unequal pupils, stable, and normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. The patient's respiratory examination is normal, with symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. The patient's abdominal examination is normal, with soft and non-tender abdomen, and present bowel sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.0 K/uL, and an elevated platelet count (Plt) of 393 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are elevated. The patient's coagulation studies, including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are pending. The patient's microbiology results, including blood cultures, are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continued antibiotic therapy, including vancomycin, pending sensitivity results
* No surgical intervention
* Indefinite continuation of lovenox, with possible transition to coumadin if reliable oral access is established
* Hypotension: lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal, with fluids given as needed
* AST elevation: check creatine kinase (CK) levels
* Dysphagia: nasogastric tube (NGT) for now, with reassessment of swallow function when the patient is transferred to the floor
* ICU care: tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism
* Bacteremia and endocarditis
* Liver and kidney dysfunction
* Neurological complications, including seizures and stroke
* Respiratory failure and ventilator dependence
* Cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure
* Gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
* Skin and soft tissue infections

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."
