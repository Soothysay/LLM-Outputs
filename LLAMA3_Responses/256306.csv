You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #2)
   - Could check cortisol, TSH (not yet done)
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derrangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. He has a recent episode of hypotension, which responded to fluid bolus. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and abnormal liver function tests. He has a history of diarrhea, which is likely contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. He also has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to splenic sequestration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concern for sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and cirrhosis increase the risk of liver failure, which could lead to further complications such as bleeding and infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and recent dialysis session increase the risk of acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and liver failure increase the risk of bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and recent diarrhea increase the risk of malnutrition, which could lead to further complications such as weakness, fatigue, and impaired immune function.
8. Amyloidosis: The patient's history of PEs and splenomegaly increase the risk of amyloidosis, which could lead to further complications such as kidney failure and heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Consider repeating the patient's blood cultures to rule out sepsis.
3. Continue to treat the patient's diarrhea with antibiotics and consider a GI consult to evaluate for possible causes.
4. Consider repeating the patient's liver function tests to evaluate for liver failure.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider repeating the patient's creatinine level to evaluate for acute kidney injury.
6. Consider repeating the patient's complete blood count to evaluate for further evidence of thrombocytopenia.
7. Consider repeating the patient's electrolyte levels to evaluate for electrolyte imbalances.
8. Consider referring the patient to a nutritionist to evaluate for malnutrition and provide recommendations for nutrition support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Two episodes of hypotension to 50s/30s overnight but patient
   was mentating well, given recent HD received gentle 250 cc bolus.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #2)
   - Could check cortisol, TSH (not yet done)
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derrangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis. The patient's history of ESRD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites, along with his recent HD, may increase his risk for sepsis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's ammonia level is low, his history of cirrhosis and ascites increases his risk for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypochloremia. The patient's recent HD may also contribute to electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of infection. The patient's history of PEs and ascites increases his risk for infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to splenic sequestration, given his history of portal hypertension and splenomegaly on US.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of ileal resection and diarrhea increases his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of ESRD increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's history of ESRD and recent HD may increase his risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and recent lack of appetite may contribute to his weakness and fatigue.
10. Amyloidosis: The patient's history of systemic amyloidosis, as expressed by the renal team, may contribute to his symptoms and complications.

The patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of his vital signs, electrolyte levels, and laboratory results. The patient should receive IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed. The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued, and he should receive a nutrition consult to address his malnutrition. The patient's code status should be discussed with him and his family, and he should be educated on his condition and treatment plan."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] re: utility of fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis.
   Briefly, he feels that amyloid is not likely secondary to ERSD, but
   that pt could have systemic amyloid of other etiology. Does not feel bx
   is urgent. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] does advise consulting GI re: mgmt of diarrhea as
   he feels the diarrhea is contributing to current sx and compromising
   overall care (pt unable to make it through an HD session without pause
   to use bathroom). Recommends considering contacting Dr. [**Name (NI) 2912**] (pt's
   hepatologist) as he may also have input.
   - Left message with dental service requesting advice on loose partial
   denture (no response yet)
   -Patient complaining of left shoulder pain today, reportedly after fall
   several days ago prior to admission.  Plain films obtained that showed

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Stop flagyl/CTX
   - f/u  cortisol, TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)

   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs. He was admitted from the ED with chief complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, and his troponin levels have been elevated. He also has thrombocytopenia and a distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concern for sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure and elevated ammonia levels could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which could cause confusion, disorientation, and even coma.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and chronic volume losses could lead to worsening renal function, which could require further dialysis and increase the risk of complications.
4. Infection: The patient's history of PEs and ascites increases his risk of developing an infection, which could be life-threatening.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and history of ileal resection increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and death.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could increase his risk of bleeding, especially in the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of PEs and chronic volume losses could increase his risk of developing another pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels could indicate cardiac damage, which could increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and even death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Administer fluids and electrolytes as needed to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Consider consulting a cardiologist to evaluate the patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac status.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if the count remains low.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider consulting a hepatologist if necessary.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist to evaluate the patient's renal function and chronic volume losses.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary status and consider consulting a pulmonologist if necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old admission to the ICU with a chief complaint of left shoulder pain after a fall several days prior to admission. The patient has a distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head. The patient is receiving antibiotics for an unknown infection and is experiencing diarrhea, which is compromising their care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 71/49 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen therapy, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.30. The patient's physical examination is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress, cardiovascular compromise, or abdominal tenderness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Amyloidosis: The patient's diagnosis of amyloidosis is uncertain, and the patient's symptoms may be exacerbated by the condition. The patient's diarrhea may be contributing to their overall poor condition, and the patient's inability to tolerate HD sessions may be a sign of malnutrition.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is compromising their care and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition. The patient's inability to tolerate HD sessions may be a sign of malnutrition.
3. Fracture: The patient's distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head may lead to respiratory compromise, cardiovascular compromise, or abdominal tenderness.
4. Infection: The patient's unknown infection may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to tolerate HD sessions and their diarrhea may lead to malnutrition, which may exacerbate their overall poor condition.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen therapy, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.30, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
7. Cardiovascular compromise: The patient's blood pressure is 71/49 mmHg, which may indicate cardiovascular compromise.
8. Abdominal tenderness: The patient's abdominal tenderness may indicate abdominal pathology, such as peritonitis or inflammatory bowel disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for the unknown infection.
2. Manage the patient's diarrhea with anti-diarrheal medications and consider consulting a gastroenterologist.
3. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of infection, malnutrition, or organ failure.
4. Consider consulting an orthopedic specialist to assess the patient's fracture and provide guidance on management.
5. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to assess the patient's diarrhea and provide guidance on management.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory support and consider adjusting therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider adjusting therapy as necessary.
8. Consider consulting a nutritionist to assess the patient's nutritional status and provide guidance on management."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #3)
   - f/u  cortisol, TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -Continue Abx for now
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Message left with dental consult.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Call out to floor if not extremely hypotensive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD

   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.

   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x

   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.

   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness and confusion. He has a leukocytosis and elevated lactate, which raises concern for sepsis. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which is thought to be contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. His troponin levels have been elevated, but the cardiac team believes it may be a new baseline in the setting of ESRD. The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to splenic sequestration. He also has upper gum pain, which is likely due to denture malalignment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to confusion, coma, and death.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he may require mechanical ventilation if his condition worsens.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of PEs increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and diarrhea increases the risk of malnutrition, which could lead to weakness, fatigue, and impaired wound healing.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of electrolyte abnormalities increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responeded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   - stopping midodrine today as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is hypotensive with a blood pressure (BP) of 72/45 mmHg. His heart rate is 95 bpm, and his respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute. He has a white blood cell count of 9.0 x 10^9/L and a lactate level of 3.8 mmol/L.

The patient has a history of chronic volume losses and diarrhea, which is likely contributing to his hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. He has also had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute to his weakness and confusion.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypotension is likely due to chronic volume losses and diarrhea, and he is being treated with fluid boluses and maintenance fluids to match his losses. The patient's weakness and confusion are likely due to metabolic derangements, infection, or malnutrition, and he is being treated with antibiotics and nutritional support. The patient's diarrhea is being treated with loperamide and stool studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis, particularly given his history of chronic volume losses and diarrhea.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites increases his risk of hepatic encephalopathy, particularly given his elevated ammonia level.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's history of malnutrition and chronic diarrhea may contribute to his weakness and confusion.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's history of chronic volume losses and diarrhea may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and sodium.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to splenic sequestration or chronic liver disease.
6. Infection: The patient's history of chronic volume losses and diarrhea increases his risk of infection, particularly urinary tract infection or peritoneal infection.
7. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of PE increases his risk of recurrent PE, particularly given his chronic volume losses and diarrhea.

Recommendations:

1. Continue fluid boluses and maintenance fluids to match the patient's losses.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as necessary.
3. Continue antibiotics for suspected infection.
4. Consider GI consult for further evaluation and management of the patient's diarrhea.
5. Consider restarting midodrine if the patient's BP remains low.
6. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusion if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responeded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. He has been experiencing hypotension, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia. His troponins have been elevated, but his CKs are flat, suggesting no acute/evolving process. He has a history of clavicle fracture and is being managed with a sling and pain control. He is also experiencing mouth pain, which is likely due to denture malalignment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis. His history of PEs and ascites requiring paracentesis also increases his risk.
2. Infection: The patient's high white count and increased lactate suggest the possibility of infection from a peritoneal, blood, pulmonary, or biliary source.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver failure and his elevated ammonia level raise concern for hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's history of ESRD and his decreased urine output suggest that he may be at risk for renal failure.
5. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient's frequent electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, may contribute to his weakness and confusion.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to splenic sequestration or other causes.
7. Diarrhea: The patient's voluminous diarrhea may be contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is significantly lower than normal, which may be contributing to his weakness and malnutrition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypotension, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia are likely due to a combination of his underlying medical conditions and his recent HD session. His elevated troponins are likely due to his ESRD and not an acute/evolving process. His mouth pain is likely due to denture malalignment. The patient's fluid status and electrolyte balance need to be closely monitored, and his diarrhea needs to be quantified and managed. He should be considered for GI consult and further evaluation for possible infections. His renal team will monitor his fluid status and BP carefully with his next HD session."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a dental procedure, partial dentures removed, and antimicrobial mouth rinse recommended. The patient was previously tachycardic after hemodialysis (HD) but responded to a 250cc IV fluid bolus. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 72/45 mmHg. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's dental procedure and antimicrobial mouth rinse suggest a risk of infection. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate an underlying infection.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, which may indicate inadequate perfusion of vital organs. This may be exacerbated by the patient's fluid overload and cardiac status.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia after HD and low blood pressure may indicate cardiac compromise. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac damage.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is high due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is increased due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which may indicate possible neurological compromise.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of infection, fluid overload, or cardiac complications.
2. Adjust the patient's fluid management to prevent fluid overload and optimize cardiac function.
3. Consider additional cardiac monitoring, such as echocardiography or cardiac enzymes, to assess the patient's cardiac status.
4. Implement strategies to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of the bed and using a sterile suction device.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider discontinuing anticoagulation therapy if bleeding is suspected.
6. Consider neurological consultation to assess the patient's neurological status and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors. Cortisol at
   3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-5-8**]:
   - Dental recs: Take out partial dentures permanently until mouth heals,
   or use only with meals if needed. Continue Orabase paste for mouth
   pain. Consider Peridex (sp?) mouth rinse if lesions develop
   (antimicrobial).
   - Called out to floor, got a bed, but rejected by floor team based on
   perceived nursing concern over SBPs in 60s-70s (patient was low to this
   range post-HD). So back in unit.
   - Tachycardic to 110s-120s post-HD, came down with 250 cc bolus of IVF

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, diarrhea, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has been receiving fluid boluses and maintenance fluids to match losses, and the renal team is monitoring fluid status and BP carefully with HD sessions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concern for sepsis, especially given the patient's history of PEs and ascites.
2. Volume Depletion: The patient's diarrhea and chronic volume losses may lead to further volume depletion, exacerbating hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's ammonia level is low, the patient's history of liver failure and cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of infection, which could be from a peritoneal, blood, pulmonary, or biliary source.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be due to splenic sequestration, given the patient's history of portal hypertension sequelae and splenomegaly on US.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is significantly lower than normal, which may contribute to weakness and other complications.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may exacerbate hypotension and other complications.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and history of ileal resection may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on the patient's progress note, it appears that the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors. Cortisol at
   3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated.
   - F/U final read of plain films
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who is admitted from the ED with chief complaints of weakness and confusion.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* HR: 95 bpm (84-123 bpm)
* BP: 72/45 mmHg (51-196/151 mmHg)
* RR: 17 inspirations per minute (12-23 inspirations per minute)

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 9.0-10.2 K/uL
* Hct: 37.7-45.6%
* Plt: 47-54
* Cr: 2.7-5.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.21-0.24 ng/mL
* Glucose: 88-152 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 22.3/40.7/2.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 40/3/0.23, ALT/AST: 14/23, Alk Phos/T Bili: 180/1.3, Differential-Neuts: 70.0%, Lymph: 24.6%, Mono: 4.8%, Eos: 0.4%, Lactic Acid: 3.8 mmol/L, LDH: 355 IU/L, Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Gen: Comfortable
* HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM
* PULM: CTAB no rales/rhonchi/wheezes
* CVS: RRR with normal S1 and S2. No m/g/r
* Abd: Soft/NT/ND
* Ext: No c/c/e, continued shoulder pain

The patient's medical conditions include:

* HYPOTENSION: Patient is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per outpatient records, baseline BP is in the 70's systolic. Patient is afebrile but has a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for sepsis.
* WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient has had a lack of appetite for the past few days. Possible causes include metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy or renal failure), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source, or malnutrition.
* DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.
* ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat) which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no acute/evolving process.
* THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
* MOUTH PAIN: Patient has upper gum pain which for him occurs with some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate raise concern for sepsis.
* Infection: The patient's high white count and increased lactate may indicate an underlying infection.
* Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated lactate and ammonia level may indicate hepatic encephalopathy.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and decreased urine output may lead to worsening renal failure.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Mucositis: The patient's mouth pain and diarrhea may indicate mucositis.
* GI bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to GI bleeding.

The patient's plan includes:

* Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to match losses.
* Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP carefully with HD sessions.
* F/U BCx - NGTD
* Off Abx
* F/U blood cultures (NGTD)
* Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain or persistent sx.
* Trend lactate
* Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
* Appreciate renal recs
* F/U Nutrition recs
* Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
* Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
* F/U stool studies (pending)
* Consider GI consult
* If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
* If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium or restart loperamide
* Plan for HD Tuesday
* Prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively, Renal Diet
* Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
* Access: peripherals
* Communication: Patient
* Code: Full (discussed with patient)
* Disposition: Likely stay in ICU for now given low BPs"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely stay in ICU for now given low BPs, consider call
   out as his BPs are stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 55/35 to 132/75 mmHg. This may lead to organ damage, including kidney damage, and increased risk of sepsis.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is voluminous and chronic, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and malnutrition. This could further exacerbate his weakness and hypotension.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may increase the risk of bleeding. This could be due to splenic sequestration or other underlying conditions.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which may indicate cardiac damage or stress. This could be related to his underlying conditions, including ESRD, or other factors such as sepsis or medication.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although the patient's ammonia level is low, he still has a history of liver failure and cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including infections or underlying conditions.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is significantly low, which may indicate malnutrition. This could contribute to his weakness, hypotension, and other medical complications.
8. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of PEs and is at risk for developing pneumonia, particularly given his chronic respiratory conditions.
9. DVT: The patient's risk of developing DVT is increased due to his immobility and underlying conditions, including ESRD and cirrhosis.
10. Infection: The patient's chronic diarrhea and leukocytosis raise concern for infection, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including C. diff, other bacterial or viral pathogens, or underlying conditions.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and treated accordingly. This may include adjusting his fluid and electrolyte management, antibiotics, and other medications, as well as considering further diagnostic testing and interventions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely stay in ICU for now given low BPs, consider call
   out as his BPs are stable.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of weakness and confusion. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure (BP) of 83/57 mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 107 bpm, and respiratory rate (RR) of 16 inspirations per minute. He has a leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and a troponin level of 0.24 ng/mL.

The patient's condition is complicated by diarrhea, which is thought to be contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. He has a history of ileal resection, which may be contributing to his chronic diarrhea. The patient's troponins have been elevated, but the levels are flat, suggesting a possible new baseline in the setting of ESRD. He has a clavicle fracture, thrombocytopenia, and mouth pain, which is likely related to denture malalignment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate hypovolemic shock, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which could cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated ammonia level and lack of asterixis on examination make hepatic encephalopathy less likely, but it should still be considered as a potential complication.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and hypotension may lead to acute kidney injury, which could worsen his renal function and require dialysis.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of PE may indicate underlying cardiovascular disease, which could lead to complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer fluid boluses as needed to maintain BP and renal function.
3. Consider a GI consult to evaluate the patient's diarrhea and potential underlying causes.
4. Continue to replete electrolytes aggressively to prevent further imbalances.
5. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and consider further evaluation for cardiac disease.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider further evaluation for thrombocytopenia.
7. Consider a neurology consult to evaluate the patient's weakness and confusion.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mouth pain and consider further evaluation for underlying dental issues."
