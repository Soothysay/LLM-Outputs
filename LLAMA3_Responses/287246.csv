   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated. Pressures slowly improved overnight.
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if hypotension improves and blood pressures
   stabilize
   - Cover with vanco alone for ?cellulitis until 48 hours negative
   culture data; no evidence for gram negative infections currently
   - Avoid further boluses, as appearing overloaded
   - Follow-up last set of pending cardiac enzymes to rule out MI
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia overnight that spontaneously
   aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at time of
   ventricular tachycardic episode.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input, for now they recommend additional 150 mg
   IV amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to
   400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam.
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Cover with vancomycin for now.
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and recent axillobifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU due to wide complex tachycardia, which was initially suspected to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but was later diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and dyspnea. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated BNP, and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows wide complex tachycardia, and his cardiac enzymes are elevated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT is a significant concern, and further episodes could lead to cardiac arrest or sudden death. The patient is at risk for recurrent VT due to the presence of pacer/ICD leads and potential new ischemia or stretch from volume overload.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be caused by sepsis, vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related hypotension. Further episodes of hypotension could lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Congestive heart failure: The patient's CHF with systolic dysfunction could worsen, leading to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or death.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be a sign of infection or hematopathology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
5. PVD with recent revascularization: The patient's PVD could lead to further complications, such as graft failure, bleeding, or infection.
6. Sacral decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus could lead to further complications, such as wound infection, sepsis, or organ dysfunction.
7. CAD: The patient's CAD could lead to further complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or death.
8. CKD: The patient's CKD could worsen, leading to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or end-stage renal disease.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's VT and hypotension in the ICU.
2. Cover the patient with vancomycin for potential cellulitis.
3. Replete magnesium and potassium aggressively.
4. Consider increasing the maintenance oral amiodarone dose to 400 mg twice daily.
5. Attempt diuresis when able to manage fluid overload.
6. Wean the patient off oxygen therapy as tolerated.
7. Continue beta blocker therapy.
8. Hold ACEI and alpha-blocker therapy until further evaluation.
9. Consider outpatient hematology workup for potential myelodysplasia.
10. Consult with vascular surgery and plastics for further evaluation and management of PVD and sacral decubitus.
11. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust therapy as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension and tachycardia. They have a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, decubitus ulcer, and supraventricular tachycardia. Overnight, the patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were treated with amiodarone and have since resolved. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Ventricular tachycardia may recur, potentially leading to ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
	* The patient's history of supraventricular tachycardia and critical limb ischemia may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they may require increasing levels of oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure may develop due to the patient's underlying conditions and immobility.
3. Infectious Complications:
	* The patient has an unknown allergy to penicillins and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase the risk of allergic reactions or antibiotic resistance.
	* The patient's decubitus ulcer may become infected, leading to sepsis or other complications.
4. Hemodynamic Complications:
	* The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate inadequate perfusion, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
	* The patient's critical limb ischemia may worsen, leading to tissue necrosis or gangrene.
5. Neurological Complications:
	* The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, and they may be at risk for neurological deterioration or seizures due to their underlying conditions.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent or mitigate these complications and improve their chances of recovery."

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient, an elderly male, is admitted to the ICU with hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, decubitus ulcer, and supraventricular tachycardia. The patient experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia overnight, which were treated with amiodarone. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are receiving respiratory support with oxygen therapy. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished lung sounds, decreased cardiac sounds, and severe peripheral edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's severe peripheral edema and the presence of vascular ulcerations and eschars on their legs and sacrum increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's lateral leg ulceration with minimal surrounding erythema and increased erythema in the proximal portion of the ulceration is concerning for cellulitis.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's bilateral heel ulcers are likely pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's diminished lung sounds and respiratory support with oxygen therapy increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased serum creatinine levels increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of critical limb ischemia and decubitus ulcer increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and peripheral edema increase the risk of DVT.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.

These potential medical complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or minimize their impact on the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; rehab rhythm appears to be
   Vtach.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Possible causes include sepsis/vasodilatory (given
   leukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers),
   cardiogenic (ACS or poor forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial
   effusion), most likely med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic
   agents for tachycardia).  Lactate not elevated.
   - Cover with vanco alone for ?cellulitis; no evidence for gram negative
   infections currently.  Will not continue levoflox but if unstable would
   provide more broad GNR coverage.
   - Avoid further boluses, as appearing overloaded.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Consider IV calcium or IV glucagon if continues to have low BPs.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia.  Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance
   is Vtach.  Discussed with cards at arrival to MICU.  Thought to be SVT
   at rehab given automatically generated ECG read.  Now back in sinus
   (vs. Apaced rhythm).  Seems to tolerate rhythm relatively well today as
   well as historically per cards (keeps pulses, asymptomatic).  Reason
   for recurrence of VT unclear - new ischemia, stretch from volume
   overload, further disruption of pacer leads leading to more irritation
   of ventricle.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Discussed with cardiology, will see in tonight.
   - If back in VT, may require further IV amiodarone load.  [**Month (only) 51**] not be
   great candidate for lido or other antiarrhythmics given poor systolic
   function.  Can also try IV beta block.
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   .
   # Hypoxia. On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam.
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic.
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  At baseline from prior admission.  Infection vs. other
   cause (with lots of monos, likely MDS or other bone marrow process).
   - Cover with vancomycin for now.
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   .
   # PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Will continue vanco with concern of ?cellulitis surrounding proximal
   ulcer.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   .
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   .
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.
   .
   # Ppx: HSQ and PPI.
   # FEN: regular low Na
   # Access: PIV x 3
   # Code: full (discussed with family at admit)
   # Disp: ICU overnight, if stable to floor cards vs. med.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; rehab rhythm appears to be
   Vtach.
   .
   # Hypotension.  Possible causes include sepsis/vasodilatory (given
   leukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers),
   cardiogenic (ACS or poor forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial
   effusion), most likely med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic
   agents for tachycardia).  Lactate not elevated.
   - Cover with vanco alone for ?cellulitis; no evidence for gram negative
   infections currently.  Will not continue levoflox but if unstable would
   provide more broad GNR coverage.
   - Avoid further boluses, as appearing overloaded.
   - Cycle enzymes.
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Consider IV calcium or IV glucagon if continues to have low BPs.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   .
   # Ventricular tachycardia.  Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance
   is Vtach.  Discussed with cards at arrival to MICU.  Thought to be SVT
   at rehab given automatically generated ECG read.  Now back in sinus
   (vs. Apaced rhythm).  Seems to tolerate rhythm relatively well today as
   well as historically per cards (keeps pulses, asymptomatic).  Reason
   for recurrence of VT unclear - new ischemia, stretch from volume
   overload, further disruption of pacer leads leading to more irritation
   of ventricle.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Discussed with cardiology, will see in tonight.
   - If back in VT, may require further IV amiodarone load.  [**Month (only) 51**] not be
   great candidate for lido or other antiarrhythmics given poor systolic
   function.  Can also try IV beta block.
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   .
   # Hypoxia. On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam.
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic.
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.  At baseline from prior admission.  Infection vs. other
   cause (with lots of monos, likely MDS or other bone marrow process).
   - Cover with vancomycin for now.
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   .
   # PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Will continue vanco with concern of ?cellulitis surrounding proximal
   ulcer.
   .
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   .
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the MICU with a history of PVD, recent axillobifemoral grafting, and a course of wide complex tachycardia. He was previously treated with multiple nodal agents for suspected SVT at rehab, but was found to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) on admission. He has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and dyspnea, with a recent episode of VT in the morning. The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, bilateral heel ulcers, and vascular ulcers on his legs, which are concerning for cellulitis. He has a history of CAD, CKD, and PVD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and gangrenous ulcers suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen his condition and lead to organ failure.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output could lead to cardiogenic shock, which would require immediate attention and treatment.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recurrent episodes of VT could lead to cardiac arrest or hemodynamic instability, requiring further treatment and management.
4. Cellulitis: The patient's vascular ulcers and gangrenous appearance suggest the possibility of cellulitis, which could spread and lead to serious complications.
5. Systolic Dysfunction: The patient's history of CAD and PVD, along with his current symptoms, suggest the possibility of systolic dysfunction, which could worsen his cardiac condition.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and pulmonary edema on CXR suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's history of CKD and decreased cardiac output could lead to worsening renal function, requiring further management and treatment.
8. Wound Infection: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer and vascular ulcers could become infected, leading to serious complications and requiring further treatment.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results, as well as manage his symptoms and treat any underlying conditions promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of ventricular tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/64 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (347 K/uL), lactate levels (0.8 mmol/L), and cardiac enzymes (CK / CKMB / Troponin-T). The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia (2.2 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (1.3 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia (3.4 mg/dL).

The patient's medical history is significant for cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has also undergone recent revascularization and has a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and hypotension increases the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and elevated respiratory rate increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and elevated creatinine levels increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of an underlying infection.
6. Myelodysplasia: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels may be indicative of myelodysplasia.
7. Cellulitis: The patient's concern of cellulitis surrounding the proximal ulcer increases the risk of further complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple comorbidities, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential medical complications."

   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 1 overnight
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if blood pressures stabilize
   - Continue vanco for ?cellulitis until 48 hours negative culture data;
   no evidence for gram negative infections currently
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09-0.10 stable
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach
   since admission.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV
   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400
   mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam. Sating 99-100% RA
   - Diuresis when able.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.

   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Cover with vancomycin for now.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent axillobifemoral grafting and was recently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for suspected ventricular tachycardia. He has been experiencing hypotension, which responded to a 250cc fluid bolus, and has a history of chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and acute on chronic congestion. He also has leukocytosis, likely due to infection or hematopathology, and has a sacral decubitus ulcer that requires wound care consult.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may be caused by sepsis, vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related hypotension. Further monitoring and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause and prevent further complications.
2. **Ventricular Tachycardia:** The patient's ventricular tachycardia may recur due to new ischemia, volume overload, or disruption of pacemaker leads. Aggressive management with magnesium and potassium repletion, as well as cardiology input, is necessary to prevent further episodes.
3. **Congestive Heart Failure:** The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to acute on chronic congestion, which may lead to further decompensation and decreased cardiac output.
4. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's leukocytosis may indicate infection or hematopathology, which may require further workup and treatment.
5. **Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:** The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected and require surgical intervention, which may increase the risk of further complications.
6. **Chronic Kidney Disease:** The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to decreased cardiac output and increased fluid overload, which may require further management and monitoring.
7. **Pulmonary Embolism:** The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and recent revascularization may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism, which requires close monitoring and prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his clinical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 1 overnight
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if blood pressures stabilize
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach
   since admission.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV
   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400
   mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam. Now sating 99-100% RA
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillobifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU for wide complex tachycardia, which was later diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which responded to a 250cc fluid bolus, and is being monitored closely in the ICU.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, vasodilatory agents, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related causes. The patient's lactate level is normal, which suggests that the hypotension is not due to sepsis.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT may be due to new ischemia, volume overload, or disruption of pacemaker leads. The patient has been receiving amiodarone and has been advised to take it orally.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to volume overload or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is being treated with diuresis and oxygen therapy.
4. Congestive heart failure: The patient has systolic dysfunction and acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure, which is evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to infection or hematopathology. The patient's cultures are negative, and he has been advised to undergo an outpatient hematology workup for possible myelodysplasia.
6. PVD: The patient's PVD may be causing his symptoms, and he is being followed by a vascular specialist.
7. Sacral decubitus: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is being treated with wound care.
8. CAD: The patient has coronary artery disease and is being treated with aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.
9. CKD: The patient has chronic kidney disease, which is being followed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring in the ICU for hypotension and VT.
2. Diuresis and oxygen therapy for hypoxia.
3. Discontinuation of vancomycin as treated and negative cultures.
4. Holding ACEI and alpha-blocker due to hypotension.
5. Continuing low-dose beta-blocker for arrhythmia.
6. Attempting diuresis later today if blood pressures stabilize.
7. Repleting magnesium and potassium aggressively.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old elderly male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of low blood pressure in the 70's, which responded to a 250cc fluid bolus. He has a history of peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, decubitus ulcer, and supraventricular tachycardia. He is currently receiving prophylactic heparin and is being monitored for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's history of decubitus ulcer and supraventricular tachycardia increases his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to his peripheral vascular disease and prolonged immobility.
3. Stress Ulcer: The patient's history of supraventricular tachycardia and decubitus ulcer increases his risk of developing stress ulcer.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases his risk of developing VAP.
5. Gangrene: The patient's dry gangrene lesions with dark eschar on his extremities increase his risk of developing gangrene.
6. Wound Infection: The patient's decubitus ulcer increases his risk of developing wound infection.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's supraventricular tachycardia and peripheral vascular disease increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory status increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to detect any potential complications.
2. Implement strategies to prevent DVT, such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin.
3. Monitor the patient's wound and decubitus ulcer for signs of infection or gangrene.
4. Consider antibiotics for the patient's decubitus ulcer to prevent infection.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider weaning the patient off mechanical ventilation and providing non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) if possible.
7. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to maintain tight glycemic control.
8. Consider referring the patient to a wound care specialist for further management of his decubitus ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a complex medical condition, including peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, decubitus ulcer, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory support is stable, with an ABG report showing adequate oxygenation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a range of abnormalities, including diminished lung sounds, carotid bruits, and bilateral pedal edema. The patient also has dry gangrene lesions with dark eschar on multiple extremities, including the left lateral lower extremity, which has an area of erythema surrounding it.

Laboratory results show a range of abnormalities, including an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased lactate levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with elevated potassium and magnesium levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening of peripheral vascular disease, leading to further limb ischemia and potential amputation.
2. Development of sepsis due to the presence of gangrene lesions and decubitus ulcer.
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential development of pneumonia.
4. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and potential electrolyte imbalances.
5. Neurological complications, such as confusion or stroke, due to the patient's underlying medical condition and potential electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to the patient's underlying medical condition and potential electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and critical limb ischemia. They have a decubitus ulcer present at admission and have experienced supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin-T level, indicating potential inflammation and cardiac damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and laboratory results suggest potential sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of SVT and elevated troponin-T level indicate potential cardiac damage, which could lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support via nasal cannula and elevated lactate level suggest potential respiratory compromise, which could lead to respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of decubitus ulcer and stress ulcer prophylaxis indicate potential gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
5. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's history of PVD and critical limb ischemia increases their risk of developing VTE, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential kidney damage, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and laboratory results suggest potential infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ dysfunction.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 1 overnight
   - Continue to monitor in ICU with possible call-out to cardiology
   service later today if blood pressures stabilize
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. No repeat episodes of v tach
   since admission.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Appreciate cardiology input- per cards, additional 150 mg IV
   amiodarone as well as maintenance oral amiodarone dose increase to 400
   mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD though not particularly
   wheezy on exam. Sating 99-100% RA
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Continue beta blocker, hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.  ? R chest hematoma however crit
   stable.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult; may need plastics intervention as well.
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and recent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU after experiencing multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which was initially thought to be supraventricular tachycardia but was later confirmed as ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been treated with multiple medications, including amiodarone, and has shown no repeat episodes of ventricular tachycardia since admission.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, which responded to a fluid bolus, and is being monitored closely. He also has evidence of congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and acute on chronic, as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. He is being treated with beta blockers and diuretics.

The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to infection or hematopathology. He has no evidence of infection, and his cultures are negative. He is being treated with antibiotics, and his fever has resolved.

The patient has a history of PVD with recent revascularization and is at risk for lower extremity wound complications. He also has sacral decubitus ulcers, which are being managed with wound care and may require plastic surgery intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related causes. Close monitoring and treatment with fluids and vasopressors may be necessary.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia may recur, and close monitoring with cardiac enzymes and ECGs is necessary. Treatment with antiarrhythmic medications and cardioversion may be necessary.
3. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's congestive heart failure may worsen, and treatment with diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors may be necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to infection or hematopathology, and close monitoring for signs of infection and treatment with antibiotics and supportive care may be necessary.
5. Lower Extremity Wound Complications: The patient's history of PVD and recent revascularization puts him at risk for lower extremity wound complications, including gangrene and amputation.
6. Sacral Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcers may worsen and require plastic surgery intervention.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and heart rhythm closely.
2. Continue treatment with beta blockers and diuretics for congestive heart failure.
3. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and treat with antibiotics and supportive care if necessary.
4. Provide wound care and consider plastic surgery intervention for sacral decubitus ulcers.
5. Consider outpatient hematology workup for myelodysplasia.
6. Follow up with vascular and plastic surgery services for wound care and potential intervention.
7. Consider cardioversion for ventricular tachycardia.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and ECGs for signs of cardiac dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia, leukocytosis, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 99/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for the presence of LE ulcers and cool skin. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and lactate levels, suggesting potential sepsis. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and recent revascularization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and lactate levels suggest potential sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and the presence of broad-complex tachycardia on the electrocardiogram (ECG) suggest a high risk of recurrent cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
3. Leukemia: The patient's persistent leukocytosis and bandemia may indicate the presence of leukemia, which can lead to bone marrow failure, infection, and bleeding.
4. Sternal Wound Infection: The patient's recent revascularization and the presence of LE ulcers suggest a high risk of sternal wound infection, which can lead to mediastinitis, sepsis, and death.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of elevated lactate levels suggest a high risk of kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of heart failure and the presence of elevated lactate levels suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and death.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and bandemia suggest a high risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent and treat these complications effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

* DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
* DYSPHAGIA
* PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITH CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
* DECUBITUS ULCER (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
* SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (SVT)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Further episodes of hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure
* Respiratory compromise due to dyspnea and potential respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal compromise due to dysphagia and potential aspiration
* Worsening of peripheral vascular disease, leading to limb loss or gangrene
* Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility
* Increased risk of infection due to decubitus ulcer and potential wound complications
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to underlying cardiac disease

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 2 overnight
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1. Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 1. CCU fellow at
   bedside.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Oral amiodarone dose increased to 400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Prednisone 60 mg q day.
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Beta blocker held for hypotension, continue as pressures tolerate,
   hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.  ? R chest hematoma however crit
   stable.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult
   - Continue wound care
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male admitted to the MICU with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and recent axillobifemoral grafting. He developed wide complex tachycardia, which was initially treated with multiple nodal agents, but the rhythm appears to be ventricular tachycardia. The patient had low blood pressure in the 70s while sleeping, which responded to fluid boluses. He also developed hypoxia, which was treated with nebs and solumedrol. The patient has leukocytosis, elevated BNP, and pulmonary edema on CXR, consistent with congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and acute on chronic. He has a history of CAD, CKD, and PVD with recent revascularization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia is a significant concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring and treating it aggressively.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still labile, and it is crucial to continue monitoring and treating it to prevent further episodes of hypotension.
3. Congestive heart failure: The patient's BNP is elevated, and he has pulmonary edema on CXR, which suggests ongoing congestive heart failure. It is essential to continue monitoring his cardiac function and treating his heart failure aggressively.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is concerning, and it is essential to continue monitoring his white blood cell count and considering outpatient hematology workup for possible myelodysplasia.
5. Wound complications: The patient has sacral decubitus and lower extremity wounds, which require ongoing wound care and monitoring for potential complications.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and history of PVD make him at risk for infection, and it is essential to continue monitoring for signs of infection and treating it aggressively if present.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's CKD is a concern, and it is essential to continue monitoring his renal function and adjusting his medications and fluids accordingly.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD and recent revascularization make him at risk for cardiovascular instability, and it is essential to continue monitoring his cardiac function and treating any episodes of instability aggressively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 2 overnight
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1. Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP converted to
   sinus rhythm using AICD.
   - Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Oral amiodarone dose increased to 400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Prednisone 60 mg q day.
   - Diuresis when able.

   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Beta blocker held for hypotension, continue as pressures tolerate,
   - hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and the potential causes include sepsis, vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related hypotension. The patient's lactate level is not elevated, which suggests that sepsis is less likely. However, the patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and recent axillobifemoral grafting increases the risk of complications.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia are concerning, and the causes are unclear. The patient's history of cardiac disease, including coronary artery disease, and recent revascularization procedures increase the risk of arrhythmias. The patient's pacemaker/ICD leads may be irritated, leading to further disruption of the ventricle.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with wheezing and dyspnea overnight. The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and volume overload exacerbate the risk of respiratory complications.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggest congestive heart failure. The patient's history of systolic dysfunction and acute on chronic heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or hematological disorder. The patient's negative cultures and lack of fever suggest that the leukocytosis may be related to a non-infectious cause.
6. Sacral Decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer is a potential source of infection and further complications.
7. Wound Care: The patient's lower extremity wounds and sacral decubitus ulcer require careful management to prevent infection and further complications.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust fluid management accordingly.
2. Re-evaluate the patient's pacemaker/ICD leads to assess for any changes or irritation.
3. Consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the patient's recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication accordingly.
6. Consider outpatient hematology workup to evaluate the patient's leukocytosis.
7. Continue to manage the patient's wounds and sacral decubitus ulcer with careful dressing changes and wound care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this
   morning. Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1, Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU after experiencing wide complex tachycardia, which is determined to be ventricular tachycardia (VT). He has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and recently underwent axillobifemoral grafting. He is also diagnosed with congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, hypoxia, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient's VT is likely related to new ischemia, volume overload, and disruption of pacer leads. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and potential treatment options.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis, vasodilatory shock, cardiogenic shock, or medication-related causes. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be necessary.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be related to volume overload, COPD, or respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to infection or hematopathology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and potential treatment options.
5. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF may worsen if not managed properly. Close monitoring of cardiac function and hemodynamics is necessary.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's CKD may worsen if not managed properly. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary.
7. Sacral Decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus may worsen if not managed properly. Close monitoring of wound care and pressure ulcer prevention is necessary.
8. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient's PVD may worsen if not managed properly. Close monitoring of wound care and vascular follow-up is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's VT and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Aggressively manage the patient's hypotension with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
3. Monitor the patient's hypoxia closely and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
4. Evaluate the patient's leukocytosis further to determine the underlying cause and potential treatment options.
5. Manage the patient's CHF closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's CKD closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Manage the patient's sacral decubitus closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's PVD closely and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU for wide complex tachycardia, which was initially thought to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but was later diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 70s while sleeping, but responded to fluid boluses. The possible causes of hypotension include sepsis, vasodilatory, cardiogenic, and medication-related factors.
2. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has had two episodes of VT, which was treated with amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and his troponin-T level has increased.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of COPD and was initially treated with non-rebreather mask (NRB) in the ED, but easily transitioned to nasal cannula (NC) in the ICU. He had increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight, which improved with the administration of solumedrol.
4. Congestive heart failure: The patient has elevated BNP levels and pulmonary edema on CXR, consistent with systolic dysfunction and acute on chronic heart failure.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history, and the cause is unclear, possibly due to infection or hematopathology.
6. PVD: The patient has a history of PVD with recent revascularization, and has a?R chest hematoma.
7. Sacral decubitus: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, and wound care consult is planned.
8. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and is taking aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker medications.
9. CKD: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and his kidney function is consistent with his recent baseline.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's VT and elevated cardiac enzymes increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Heart failure: The patient's systolic dysfunction and pulmonary edema increase the risk of heart failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and hypoxia increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lack of normal WBC count in recent history increase the risk of infection.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's PVD and?R chest hematoma increase the risk of hemorrhage.
7. Wound complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer and PVD increase the risk of wound complications.
8. Kidney failure: The patient's CKD and potential nephrotoxic medications increase the risk of kidney failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
2. Aggressive repletion of magnesium and potassium.
3. Oral amiodarone dose increase to 400 mg twice daily.
4. Pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
5. TTE to evaluate for any change in pacer/ICD leads or significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
6. Diuresis when able.
7. Wound care consult for sacral decubitus ulcer.
8. Outpatient hematology workup for?myelodysplasia.
9. Vascular following for PVD.
10. Continued medication management for CAD and CKD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1. Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 1. CCU fellow at
   bedside.
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Oral amiodarone dose increased to 400 mg twice daily
   - Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Prednisone 60 mg q day.
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Beta blocker held for hypotension, continue as pressures tolerate,
   hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.  ? R chest hematoma however crit
   stable.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillo-bifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU for wide complex tachycardia, which was initially thought to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but was later determined to be ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient had a previous episode of asymptomatic VT on the night of admission, which spontaneously aborted. He was given amiodarone 150 mg IV and lidocaine 75 mg IV to treat the VT.

The patient has several comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic, and CAD. He also has a history of COPD and PVD with recent revascularization.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Hypotension, which responded to fluid boluses
* Ventricular tachycardia, which is being treated with amiodarone and lidocaine
* Hypoxia, which is being treated with oxygen therapy and diuresis
* Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic
* Leukocytosis, which is being investigated for possible infection or hematopathology
* Sacral decubitus, which requires wound care
* PVD with recent revascularization, which requires vascular follow-up

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis and questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers, there is a possibility of sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction may lead to cardiogenic shock.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's CKD and recent use of nephrotoxic medications may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and recent use of oxygen therapy may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Wound infection: The patient's sacral decubitus and PVD with recent revascularization may increase the risk of wound infection.
6. Pacer/ICD lead failure: The patient's recurrent VT and history of PVD may increase the risk of pacer/ICD lead failure.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and history of cardiogenic shock may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of CHF, EF 20%, PVD, and recent axillary-bifemoral bypass surgery. He had a ventricular tachycardia episode overnight, which was converted with amiodarone and lidocaine. He also had persistent hypotension, which responded to fluid boluses. The patient has chronically elevated WBC counts.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/61 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 26 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 25.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: not reported
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.09 ng/mL
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and CHF increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and SOB may progress to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's chronically elevated WBC count and recent surgery increase his risk of developing sepsis.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of PVD may indicate kidney injury or damage.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's critical illness and history of CHF may lead to malnutrition if not managed promptly.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and critical illness increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's history of PVD and recent surgery increase his risk of developing thrombosis.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of CHF and recent surgery increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory status, and fluid balance. Further evaluation and treatment of his chronic conditions, such as CHF and COPD, are necessary to improve his overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT this
   morning. Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1, Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP
   converted to sinus rhythm via patient
s AICD.
   - Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   Needs eventual pacer/ICD lead replacement if appropriate candidate.
   - Will recheck TTE to eval for any change in the pacer/ICD leads or
   significant change in function to explain recurrent VT.
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated.
   - Hypotension responded to 250 cc fluid bolus x 2 overnight
   - D/c vanco as treated for 48 hours with continued negative culture
   data; Afebrile
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   - Attempt diuresis later today if BP stabilizes.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Prednisone 60 mg q day.
   - Diuresis when able.
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - Beta blocker held for hypotension, continue as pressures tolerate,
   - hold ACEI for now with hypotension.
   - hold PO lasix, will attempt to diurese once hemodynamic issues
   resolve.
   .
   # Leukocytosis.
   Patient has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. Infection
   vs. hematopatholgy.
   - Will d/c vanco as Afebrile, cultures negative
   - Consider outpatient hematology workup for ?myelodysplasia.
   # PVD with recent revascularization.
   - Vascular following.
   - Lower extremity wound care per vascular
   # Sacral decubitus.
   - Wound care consult
   - Continue wound care
   # CAD
   - ASA, statin, BB
   # CKD.  Consistent with recent baseline.  Will follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old male with a history of Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), and recent axillofemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU for wide complex tachycardia, which was later diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.2°C (97.1°F), HR: 84 bpm, BP: 118/70 mmHg, RR: 26 breaths per minute, SpO2: 97%
* Physical examination: The patient is alert and oriented, with no respiratory distress. He has diminished heart sounds, and his abdomen is soft and mildly distended. He has 2+ pitting edema of his dependent extremities and multiple dry gangrene lesions with dark eschar.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 19.1 x 10^9/L, and his platelet count is 109 x 10^9/L. His creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is 0.09 ng/mL.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has had two episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which was terminated with amiodarone and lidocaine. He has also been prescribed oral amiodarone and mexiletine to prevent further episodes.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and he has required fluid boluses to maintain a stable blood pressure.
* Hypoxia: The patient has had difficulty breathing, which has been attributed to volume overload and his history of COPD.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient has elevated BNP levels and pulmonary edema on CXR, which suggests systolic dysfunction and acute on chronic heart failure.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which may be due to infection or hematopathology.
* PVD with recent revascularization: The patient has a history of PVD and recent axillofemoral grafting.
* Sacral decubitus: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is taking aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker medications.
* CKD: The patient has CKD and is being followed.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and CAD increases his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Heart failure: The patient's history of systolic dysfunction and acute on chronic heart failure increases his risk of heart failure.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and sacral decubitus ulcer increase his risk of infection.
* Wound complications: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer and PVD with recent revascularization increase his risk of wound complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's CKD and history of recent axillofemoral grafting increase his risk of renal failure.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, hypotension, dyspnea, dysphagia, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, decubitus ulcer, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were terminated with amiodarone, lidocaine, and mexiletine. The patient has also received furosemide for diuresis, resulting in a slight increase in urine output overnight.

The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 118/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 409 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history includes a decubitus ulcer, which is present at admission, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may continue to progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and the use of anti-arrhythmic medications may increase the risk of future ventricular arrhythmias.
3. Decubitus ulcer progression: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as infection and sepsis.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's dyspnea and hypotension may be indicative of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Sepsis: The patient's decubitus ulcer and history of supraventricular tachycardia may increase the risk of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and recent axillobifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the MICU for wide complex tachycardia, which was initially thought to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but was later diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has had multiple episodes of VT, which have been treated with amiodarone, lidocaine, and mexiletine. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he has a slightly decreased ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hypotension, which may be related to sepsis, vasodilatory agents, or cardiogenic causes. He also has hypoxia, which is likely related to volume overload and his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic dysfunction and acute on chronic CHF, as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.

The patient has leukocytosis, which may be related to infection or hematopathology. He has a history of PVD with recent revascularization and is at risk for lower extremity wound complications. The patient also has sacral decubitus, which requires wound care. His medication regimen includes beta blockers, statins, and aspirin for his coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT may recur, and further treatment options may be needed to manage this condition.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis, vasodilatory agents, or cardiogenic causes, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may worsen if his volume overload is not managed effectively, and further treatment options may be needed to improve his oxygenation.
4. Congestive heart failure: The patient's CHF may worsen if his systolic dysfunction is not managed effectively, and further treatment options may be needed to improve his cardiac function.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to infection or hematopathology, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.
6. PVD: The patient's PVD may lead to further complications, such as lower extremity wound complications, and close monitoring and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
7. Sacral decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus may worsen if not managed effectively, and further treatment options may be needed to prevent further complications.

In conclusion, the patient has a complex medical condition with multiple ongoing issues, including VT, hypotension, hypoxia, CHF, leukocytosis, PVD, and sacral decubitus. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage these conditions and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 84M with history of PVD s/p recent axillobifemoral grafting with
   course c/b wide complex tachycardia; now admit to MICU after getting
   multiple nodal agents for ?SVT at rehab; however, rhythm appears to be
   ventricular tachycardia.
   # Ventricular tachycardia:
   Wide complex tachycardia but ECG appearance is Vtach.  Discussed with
   cards at arrival to MICU. Reason for recurrence of VT unclear - new
   ischemia, stretch from volume overload, and further disruption of pacer
   leads leading to more irritation of ventricle. Patient with episode of
   asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia on night of admission that
   spontaneously aborted. Patient also received amiodarone 150 mg IV at
   time of ventricular tachycardic episode. Repeat episode of VT [**3-9**] am.
   Given amiodarone 150 mg IV x 1, Lidocaine 75 mg IV x 2. EP converted to
   sinus rhythm via patient
s AICD.  No repeat episodes since that time.
   - Mexiletine 150 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Oral amiodarone 400 mg twice daily
   - Replete mag and potassium aggressively.
   - Per cards not a candidate for lead replacement, will continue medical
   management.
   - TTE [**3-9**] showed slightly inc EF (25-30%), slightly decreased left
   ventricular cavity size and slightly worse mitral regurg.
   - Will call out to cardiology today as no v tach x 24 hours and BPs
   stable
   # Hypotension:
   Possible causes include sepsis / vasodilatory (given leukocytosis and
   questionable appearance of gangrenous ulcers), cardiogenic (ACS or poor
   forward flow from CHF; less likely pericardial effusion), most likely
   med related (multiple nodal/negative inotropic agents for tachycardia).
   Lactate not elevated. Vancomycin d/c
d after 48 hours with continued
   negative culture data; Afebrile.
   - Pressures stable overnight.
   - Cardiac enzymes
 trop 0.09->0.10
   - Hold ACEI and alpha block, continue low dose beta block given
   arrhythmia as BPs tolerate.
   # Hypoxia:
   On NRB in ED but easily transitioned to NC in ICU.  Likely volume
   overload related.  Also with history of COPD. Sating 99-100% RA.
   Increased wheezing and dyspnea overnight without relief with nebs.
   Given solumedrol 125 mg IV with improvement.
   - Steroids and nebs d/c
   - Continue diuresis
   .
   # Congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, acute on chronic:
   Elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR.
   - BB dose increased o/n continue beta blocker as pressures tolerate
   - hold ACEI for now with hypotension.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 84-year-old male with a history of Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) who underwent recent axillobifemoral grafting. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after experiencing multiple episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which was initially diagnosed as Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT), but was later confirmed as Ventricular Tachycardia (VT).

The patient's current condition is stable, with no episodes of VT since the administration of amiodarone and lidocaine. However, he is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he is at risk for hypotension due to the use of multiple nodal agents for tachycardia and the presence of PVD.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of COPD and is at risk for hypoxia, particularly with the presence of pulmonary edema on CXR.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic Dysfunction, and Acute on Chronic: The patient's elevated BNP and pulmonary edema on CXR suggest CHF, and his systolic dysfunction is likely acute on chronic.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he has no normal recorded WBC count in recent history. This may indicate infection or hematopathology.
5. PVD with recent revascularization: The patient's PVD is a significant risk factor for complications, and his recent revascularization may have contributed to his current condition.
6. Sacral decubitus: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is a risk factor for infection and further complications.
7. CAD: The patient has a history of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), which increases his risk for cardiac complications.
8. CKD: The patient has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which may worsen his condition and increase his risk for complications.

The patient's current medications include amiodarone, lidocaine, mexiletine, and oral amiodarone, as well as diuretics and beta-blockers. He is also receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT and stress ulcer.

The patient's ICU care includes regular nutrition, low sodium/heart-healthy consistency, and glycemic control. His lines include a 22G line inserted on 3/9. He is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT and stress ulcer, and his code status is FULL."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old man with chronic systolic heart failure, admitted with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT). Today, he had multiple runs of VT, which responded to 150mg IV amiodarone. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84bpm, blood pressure of 118/70mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has anemia, but no other significant changes in his review of systems. His physical examination is normal, with no acute distress or signs of abuse. Laboratory results show stable chronic renal failure, with some fluctuations in his white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent VT: The patient's VT episodes may continue to recur, requiring further management and potentially increasing the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's DNR/DNI status and history of cardiac arrest may increase the risk of cardiac arrest if VT recurs.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, potentially leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infections.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, potentially leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of cardiac arrest may increase his risk of infection, potentially leading to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and immobility may increase his risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition may not be adequate, potentially leading to malnutrition and decreased immune function.
8. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels may fluctuate, potentially leading to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, and increasing the risk of complications."
