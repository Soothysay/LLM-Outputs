   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP, continue
   vanc/cefepime and DC flagyl  (terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN

   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above

    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who fell out of bed and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis and is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia has worsened, and she requires further evaluation and treatment.
2. Fall with multiple fractures and laceration: The patient has multiple fractures and lacerations, including an intraarticular right knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture, with associated head injury and deep laceration to the right arm and tear of the left leg.
3. Hypothermia: The patient was previously hypothermic, but the condition has been resolved. However, there is concern for possible infectious sepsis, and blood and urine cultures have been obtained.
4. AMS (Acute Mental Status Change): The patient is suspected to have multifactorial AMS, including toxic-metabolic abnormalities, hospital delirium, and/or infection that is being untreated.
5. Oliguria: The patient has intermittent oliguria during hospitalization, which may be related to poor PO intake and chronic kidney disease.
6. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved to 2.9, but she has acute on chronic renal failure, and her renal function will need to be closely monitored.
7. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient has a history of myelodysplastic disorder and has experienced acute blood loss due to multiple ecchymoses/hematomas.
8. Crohn's disease: The patient has diarrhea, which may be related to Kayexalate given for hyperkalemia.
9. Hx of PE/DVT: The patient has a history of PE/DVT and is currently at risk for bleeding due to significant lacerations and fractures.
10. Loss of vision/cataracts: The patient has lost vision in her left eye and has been recommended to continue home eye drops.
11. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer and is being followed by wound care.
12. FEN (Fluid, Electrolyte, and Nutrition): The patient requires careful monitoring of her fluid and electrolyte status due to her chronic kidney disease and recent blood loss.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Non-invasive ventilation with titration of FiO2 and PEEP to maintain SpO2 > 90%.
2. Antibiotics for suspected HAP and C. diff.
3. Pain management with scheduled Tylenol and PRN morphine.
4. Ortho recs for follow-up in 2 weeks.
5. Vitamin A and dressing changes as per Plastics.
6. Increased Decadron for hyperkalemia.
7. Monitor urine output and adjust IVF as needed.
8. Renally dose medications as appropriate.
9. Kayexalate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic.
10. Steroids for Crohn's disease.
11. Folate and B12 injections monthly.
12. Eye drops as per home regimen.
13. Wound care recs.
14. Prophylaxis for DVT and bowel regimen.
15. Insulin Sliding Scale while on increased Decadron.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending improvement, and consideration will be given to calling out if she becomes stable on PRN bipap."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP, continue
   vanc/cefepime and DC flagyl  (terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco.
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine
   prn
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  Upon transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.9 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP, continue
   vanc/cefepime and DC flagyl  (terrible diarrhea in the past)

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis. She has multiple fractures and lacerations, including a right knee and femur fracture, and a deep laceration to her right arm and tear of her left leg. The patient has been treated with non-invasive ventilation and antibiotics, and has been experiencing worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis may lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infectious Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infectious sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI, which could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to her acute kidney injury, leading to further complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.
5. Anemia: The patient's acute blood loss and history of myelodysplastic disorder may lead to further anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Crohn's Disease Flare: The patient's current diarrhea may be related to her Crohn's disease, which could worsen and lead to further complications.
7. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's history of PE and DVT may increase her risk of developing a new PE, which could be life-threatening.
8. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's immobility and pressure sores may lead to the development of decubitus ulcers, which could worsen and lead to further complications.
9. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening consequences.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen to cover potential infections.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Consider transfusing the patient with packed red blood cells to address her anemia.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's Crohn's disease and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further flares.
6. Consider ordering a CT scan to rule out PE and DVT.
7. Monitor the patient's decubitus ulcers and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further complications.
8. Consider ordering a urine culture to rule out infection.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The 83-year-old female patient is admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including Crohn's disease, bleeding, and clotting disorders. She has sustained multiple fractures and lacerations after falling out of bed, resulting in hypercarbic respiratory failure, respiratory acidosis, and oliguria.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP, continue
   vanc/cefepime and DC flagyl  (terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco.
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine
   prn
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  Upon transfer patient is getting D5/NS at 125mL/hr.
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.9 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - continue mesalamine once tolerating PO
    - could consider Mesalamine enemas if truly thought to be flair
    - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Mattress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN: IVF prn / Replete PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia / NPO while
   mental status poor
   # Prophylaxis:
    - DVT
 IVC filter, hold heparin/lovenox
    - Bowel regimen
    - PPI given steroids

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with worsened hypercarbia
   upon evaluation today.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given
   recent injury but last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that
   has been untreated but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at
   home.  Other considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture
   and off Lovenox) vs PNA.

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, multiple fractures, and ecchymosis. She was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Hypercarbic respiratory failure, worsened upon evaluation today. CXR shows new consolidation, and the patient is being treated for HAP with antibiotics.
* Cardiovascular status: Blood pressure is stable, but the patient has a history of PE/DVT and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.
* Renal status: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a baseline Cr of 2.2, which has improved to 2.9 today. The patient is receiving IVF and is being monitored for fluid balance.
* Hematological status: The patient has acute blood loss anemia and is receiving PRBC transfusions. The patient's Hct is being monitored daily.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has diarrhea and is being treated with mesalamine. The patient is also at risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
* Neurological status: The patient has AMS and is at risk for hospital delirium and/or infection. The patient's mental status is being monitored, and sedating medications are being avoided.
* Skin status: The patient has multiple lacerations and ecchymosis, and is at risk for decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, and the patient is at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of PE/DVT and current anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infections: The patient's multiple lacerations and ecchymosis may increase the risk of infection.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's diarrhea and inability to tolerate PO may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
7. Delirium: The patient's AMS may worsen, leading to delirium.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive non-invasive ventilation.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for HAP and C. diff infection.
3. Pain management: The patient will receive morphine PRN for pain management.
4. Fluid management: The patient will continue to receive IVF and will be monitored for fluid balance.
5. Nutritional support: The patient will receive enteral nutrition and will be monitored for nutritional deficiencies.
6. Wound care: The patient's multiple lacerations and ecchymosis will be monitored and treated by wound care.
7. Infection control: The patient will receive antibiotics for any suspected infections, and will be monitored for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, bleeding, and clotting disorders. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis.

The patient has experienced multiple complications, including:

1. Positive blood cultures with GPC in pairs and clusters, likely contaminant, already on vancomycin.
2. Fall with multiple fractures and lacerations, including intraarticular right knee and femur fractures, and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg.
3. Hypothermia, which has resolved, but concerns for possible infectious sepsis.
4. AMS (altered mental status) suspected multifactorial, including toxic-metabolic abnormalities, hospital delirium, and/or untreated infection.
5. Oliguria, with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization, likely related to poor PO intake and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Acute on chronic renal failure, with Cr improved to 2.7 today, baseline is 2.2.
7. Acute on chronic anemia, with history of myelodysplastic disorder, and acute blood loss due to multiple ecchymoses and hematomas.
8. Crohn's disease, with diarrhea, which may be related to Kayexelate given for hyperkalemia.
9. History of PE/DVT, with last DVT 5-8 months ago, and concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and fractures.
10. Loss of vision/cataracts, with per daughter lost vision in left eye 2 months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors.
11. Decubitus ulcer, being followed by wound care with multiple recommendations.

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, pantoprazole, morphine, and decadron. She is also receiving IVF and has a port.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 4.6-6.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of c-diff colitis. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and cefipime, with the most recent dose administered on [**2195-4-3**] 10:20 PM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 75 bpm (74-103 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 124/56 mmHg (73-131/62 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (13-30 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block

The patient is receiving respiratory support with a bipap mask, and their ventilation settings are:

* Ventilator mode: MMV/PSV/AutoFlow
* Tidal volume (set): 300 mL
* Tidal volume (spontaneous): 767 mL
* Peak inspiratory pressure: 25 cmH2O
* Positive end-expiratory pressure: 5 cmH2O
* Fraction of inspired oxygen: 30%

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 4.6-6.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.5-8.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 114-136 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.6 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR): 10.7/0.9
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 28.1 seconds

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in certain areas, such as peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the c-diff infection
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's respiratory support requirements
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's first-degree AV block
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels
* Worsening of the patient's c-diff infection due to the continued use of antibiotics

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - repeat CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, bleeding, and clotting disorders. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and oliguria. She has multiple fractures and lacerations, including a right femur fracture, right elbow fracture, and deep laceration to the right arm and tear of the left leg. She also has a history of positive blood cultures, hypernatremia, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition may worsen if her respiratory acidosis is not addressed.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and she may require further treatment for her renal failure.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is decreasing, and she may require further treatment to improve her kidney function.
4. Positive blood cultures: The patient's blood cultures are positive, and she may require further treatment for her bloodstream infection.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and she may require further treatment to address her hypernatremia.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is decreasing, and she may require further treatment to address her hypothermia.
7. AMS (Acute Mental Status): The patient's mental status is changing, and she may require further treatment to address her AMS.
8. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, and she may require further treatment to address her anemia.

10. Loss of vision/cataracts: The patient's vision is decreasing, and she may require further treatment to address her cataracts.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's respiratory acidosis needs to be addressed, and her renal function needs to be monitored closely. The patient's blood cultures need to be repeated, and she may require further treatment for her bloodstream infection. The patient's hypernatremia and hypothermia need to be addressed, and her AMS needs to be monitored closely. The patient's anemia needs to be treated, and her Crohn's disease needs to be managed. The patient's vision loss and cataracts need to be addressed, and her decubitus ulcer needs to be treated."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - repeat CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   - consider lasix in next several days
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics; confirm that they are
   changing the dressings (vs would like primary team to change
   dressings).
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: suspect
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco. Treat HAP as
   above.
   - f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - echo if high grade bacteremia
   # Hypernatremia
free water deficit 2.1 L
   - 1 L fluid bolus + PO intake.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.7 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  This AM Creatinine 2.4
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now as above
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine
   prn
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - mesalamine PO
   - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
 considering IVC filter
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.
    - eye gtts per home regimen
   # Decubitus ulcer: Being followed by wound care with multiple
   recommendations.
    - Atmos Air Mattress
    - Wound Care recs
   # FEN: hold IVF/ Replete PRN & monitor for hyperkalemia / start to
   advance diet today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, bleeding, and clotting disorders. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis due to non-invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple fractures, lacerations, and ecchymosis from a fall, and is experiencing pain, hypercarbia, and respiratory acidosis. She has a history of positive blood cultures, hypernatremia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, oliguria, hypothermia, and acute-on-chronic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and potentially requiring intubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and hypothermia suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine levels may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
5. Acute-on-chronic anemia: The patient's acute blood loss and anemia may worsen, leading to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and death.
6. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's immobility and pressure sores may worsen, leading to complications such as infection, sepsis, and death.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's positive blood cultures and respiratory acidosis suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and potentially require intubation.
8. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of DVT and PE, as well as her current immobility, may increase her risk of developing a DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and potentially require anticoagulation therapy.
9. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and hypothermia suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis and potentially require antibiotics and other supportive care.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess the severity of her hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.
2. Consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if the patient's hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis worsen.
3. Administer antibiotics and antifungal medications as needed to treat the patient's positive blood cultures and hypothermia.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider administering medications to correct hypernatremia and hypokalemia.
6. Consider transfusing blood products if the patient's anemia worsens.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's wound care and consider debridement and dressing changes as needed.
8. Consider administering anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and consider administering antibiotics and other supportive care as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   - consider lasix in next several days
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN
    - Ortho recs (will need follows in 2 weeks with [**Doctor Last Name 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11762**])
    - Vitamin A per Plastics
    - Take down brace once daily for skin checks
    - Avoid creams/lotions as may macerate skin further
    - Will need Plastics follow-up Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] @ [**Hospital3 290**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11763**]
    - Dressing changes Q3 days per Plastics
   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco. Treat HAP as
   above.
   - f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - echo if high grade bacteremia
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8
    - Continue abx as above
    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain
 morphine
   prn
    - Avoid unnessary wake-ups
   # Oliguria: Patient with intermittent oliguria during hospitalization.
   This has been in conjunction with poor po intake and [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD.
   Baseline Cr 2.2.  This AM Creatinine 2.4
    - Monitor urine output
    - Continue IVF for now
    - If poor urine output: Ulytes, UEos (multiple antibiotics exposures)
   - Goal for fluid is negative, continue to monitor and treat with lasix
   if needed
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr improved to 2.7 today, baseline is
   2.2. Per renal, somewhere between pre-renal and ATN. Renal ultrasound
   without hydronephrosis.
    - cont to monitor
    - Renally dose as appropriate
    - Kayexelate PR/PO if newly hyperkalemic
   # Acute on chronic anemia: History of myelodysplastic disorder, now
   with acute blood loss [**3-3**] to multiple eccymoses /  hematomas.  CT
   abdomen negative for RP bleed.  S/p 4U PRBC prior to transfer to the
   ICU.
    - Steroids as above (increased dosing)
    - PPx Bactrim once taking improved PO
    - monitor Hct daily
    - T&S
    - B12 injections monthly, Folate
   # Crohn's: Currently with diarrhea, though may be related to Kayexelate
   given for hyperkalemia
    - mesalamine PO
   - Increased steroids as above
    - f/u C. Diff culture, hold flagyl
   # Hx of PE/DVT: last DVT [**5-8**] with PICC. Was on lovenox at home, but
   now concern for bleeding in setting of significant lacerations and
   fractures. Lovenox held briefly while inpatient for acute blood loss
   anemia.   She has IVC filter.
    - follow Hct
   - hold lovenox for now
 considering IVC filter
   # Loss of vision/cataracts: per daughter lost vision in left eye 2
   months ago, no eye evaluation since due to unable to get to doctors
   [**Name5 (PTitle) **].  Ophthalmology consulted while inpatient and recommended
   continuation of home eye drops.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Crohn's disease, bleeding, and clotting disorders. She was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, fall-related injuries, and positive blood cultures.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: Hypocarbia improved, but still requires non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) with a goal of pH < 7.2 or CO2 > 65.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, hypertension, and hypotension are noted.
* Neurological: The patient's mental status is unclear due to the presence of pain, sedatives, and potential sepsis.
* Renal: Acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and oliguria.
* Hematological: Acute blood loss anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 114 K/uL.
* Infections: Positive blood cultures, likely due to GPC, and possible sepsis.
* Wounds: Multiple fractures, lacerations, and decubitus ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require invasive mechanical ventilation if her condition deteriorates.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and potential sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
4. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding disorders and anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of invasive lines and devices can increase the risk of secondary infections.
6. Wound complications: The patient's multiple wounds and decubitus ulcers can lead to further complications, including infection, necrosis, and death.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia, hypertension, and hypotension can indicate cardiovascular instability, which can worsen her overall condition.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal status. She should be treated with antibiotics, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy as necessary. The patient's wounds should be closely monitored, and decubitus ulcers should be prevented and treated promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   - consider lasix in next several days
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued
   [**2195-4-2**]
    - Pain management: Tylenol scheduled (PR while NPO), Morphine PRN

   # Positive Blood Cultures: GPC in pairs and clusters, [**2-2**]: likely
   contaminant, will await speciation, already on vanco. Treat HAP as
   above.
   - f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - echo if high grade bacteremia
   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.
    - Decadron 4mg IV Q8

    - Send C.diff x 3
    - CXR to evaluate for pulmonary process --> with e/o new
   consolidation, will treat for HAP as above
    - Follow-up cultures
   # AMS: Suspect multifactorial including toxic-metabolic abnormalities
   (hypercarbia, infection); hospital delirium and/or infection that is
   being untreated.  UA from catheter concerning infection, awaiting urine
   culture.
    - Infectious work-up as above
    - Avoid sedating medications while trying to control pain

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including Crohn's disease, who was admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, multiple fractures, and lacerations. She has been treated with antibiotics, pain management, and has undergone various diagnostic tests. Her current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure with improved VBG
* Pain management with Tylenol and Morphine PRN
* Infections, including HAP, sepsis, and possible PNA
* Renal failure, with a baseline Cr of 2.2 and current Cr of 2.4
* Anemia due to acute blood loss and myelodysplastic disorder
* Diarrhea and possible C. Diff infection
* Oliguria and possible acute kidney injury
* Hypothermia, which has resolved
* AMS, possibly due to toxic-metabolic abnormalities, hospital delirium, and/or untreated infection

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as respiratory acidosis and respiratory arrest.
2. Infections: The patient's infections, including HAP, sepsis, and possible PNA, may progress and lead to septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as cardiovascular disease, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Oliguria: The patient's oliguria may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia may recur if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and death.
7. AMS: The patient's AMS may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as delirium, confusion, and decreased ability to respond to medical interventions.
8. Decubitus ulcer: The patient's decubitus ulcer may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as infection, tissue necrosis, and sepsis.
9. C. Diff infection: The patient's C. Diff infection may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.
10. Loss of vision: The patient's loss of vision may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as decreased quality of life, depression, and anxiety."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with very complicated medical history including
   Crohn's disease, with both bleeding and clotting who fell out of bed
   and sustained multiple fractures and ecchymosis; transferred to the ICU
   [**2195-4-2**] for hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis for non-invasive
   ventilation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with improved VBG this
   morning.  Initially suspected [**3-3**] narcotics use given recent injury but
   last dosing was [**3-28**].  Could also consider OSA that has been untreated
   but daughter states patient rarely uses CPAP at home.  Other
   considerations include PE (given history, femur fracture and off
   Lovenox) vs PNA.
    - CXR --> with e/o new consolidation, will treat for HAP
   -  continue vanc/cefepime (No flagyl d/t terrible diarrhea in the past)
    - Hold CTA, Ddimer given ARF/CKD
   -  follow VBG
 start noninvasive if pH< 7.2 or CO2> 65
   - consider lasix in next several days
   # Fall with mulitple fractures and laceration: Intraarticular right
   knee/femur fracture and right elbow fracture with associated head
   injury and deep laceration to right arm and tear of left leg. Pt became
   more sleepy with oxycodone, so this was discontinued.  She was then
   treated with 7 days of Cefazolin per Ortho recs.  This was discontinued

   # Hypothermia: Noted [**2195-4-2**], now resolved.  Concern for possible
   infectious sepsis.  Blood and urine cultures were obtained.  She was
   bolused with NS and treated with increased Dexamethasone given she's
   chronically on steroids for her Crohn's disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Crohn's disease, bleeding, and clotting disorders. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis, and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. She has multiple fractures, ecchymosis, and a deep laceration on her right arm, as well as a tear on her left leg. She has also developed a decubitus ulcer and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying conditions.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures and is at risk for sepsis. She is also at risk for pneumonia and other infections due to her prolonged hospitalization and immobility.
3. Kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying chronic kidney disease.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute blood loss and is at risk for further anemia due to her underlying myelodysplastic disorder.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and is at risk for further thromboembolic events due to her immobility and underlying conditions.
6. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer and is at risk for further complications, including infection and tissue necrosis.
7. Pressure injuries: The patient is at risk for pressure injuries due to her immobility and underlying conditions.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk for nutritional deficiencies due to her prolonged hospitalization and limited oral intake.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has Crohn's disease and is at risk for gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea, constipation, and malnutrition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan should focus on addressing her respiratory failure, infection, kidney injury, anemia, thromboembolic events, decubitus ulcer, pressure injuries, nutritional deficiencies, and gastrointestinal complications. This may involve adjusting her medications, providing additional supportive care, and implementing measures to prevent further complications."
