   Assessment and Plan
   61F w/ ongoing Crohn's flare refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira
   induction, with RUE DVT and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through
   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding
   # Acute blood loss anemiaCrohn's disease wtih intermittant
   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  no melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; slowly trending down still.  Patient is still
   hemodynamically stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - cont Q6 HCT check for now; d/w GI whether any other studies
   necessary; seems to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to
   evaluate for small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H
   - not getting any PO meds right now; may consider restarting POs today-
   since likely no other imaging studies right now.
   - given a dose of MTX yesterday per GI.  Also recently started on
   Humira- got 2 doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - on IV levothyroxine until able to take POs.  will change once
   tolerating POs
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient. Will hold
   anti-hypertensives for now in the setting of large GI bleed. Continues
   to be very hypertensive
   - titrated up on Hydral to 30 mg IV Q6H with prn labetaolol IV
   - will restart PO medications this AM- atenolol and moexipril
   # Osteoporosis: On Alendronate q Sunday and vitamin D/Calcium
   supplementation.
   - Continue outpatient regimen
   # Access: Currently has left sided PICC in place with dual lumen.
   # FEN: Patient is on TPN as an outpatient due to her malnutrition.
   - Continue TPN as per nutrition recs
   - Clear liquid diet
   - ISS given TPN and steroids
   - Follow amylase, lipase and LFTs on TPN
   # PPX: Pneumoboots, no heparin given GI bleed, not on ppi as outpatient
   but given duodenitis on EGD, will start protonix q24H

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, anemia, and melena. She underwent a colonoscopy with ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease and was started on ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and methotrexate. The patient remains hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 189/71 mmHg. She has a rectovaginal fistula and is experiencing persistent bloody diarrhea. The patient has a DVT in her right upper extremity and is unable to be anticoagulated due to her active GI bleed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's ongoing bleeding and anemia may lead to hemorrhagic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's fluid loss due to diarrhea and bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to Crohn's disease and ongoing bleeding may increase her risk of infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may lead to sepsis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may lead to thrombocytopenia.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may exacerbate her hypothyroidism.
7. Hypertension: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may exacerbate her hypertension.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may exacerbate her malnutrition.
9. Osteoporosis: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may exacerbate her osteoporosis.
10. DVT: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infection may exacerbate her DVT.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and hematocrit levels closely.
2. Administer blood products as needed to maintain the patient's hematocrit levels.
3. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding with ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and methotrexate.
4. Consider restarting PO medications, including proton pump inhibitors, to help manage the patient's bleeding and potential infection.

   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding

   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  no melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; slowly trending down still.  Patient is still
   hemodynamically stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - repeat HCT this PM; d/w GI whether any other studies necessary; seems
   to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to evaluate for
   small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H
   - not getting any PO meds right now; may consider restarting POs today-
   since likely no other imaging studies right now.
   - given a dose of MTX yesterday per GI.  Also recently started on
   Humira- got 2 doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - on IV levothyroxine until able to take POs.  will change once
   tolerating POs
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient. Will hold
   anti-hypertensives for now in the setting of large GI bleed. Continues
   to be very hypertensive
   - titrated up on Hydral to 30 mg IV Q6H with prn labetaolol IV
   - will restart PO medications this AM- atenolol and moexipril

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, anemia, and melena. She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease, but no active sites of bleeding. She was started on ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and methotrexate, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored due to hypertension. The patient has a rectovaginal fistula and is experiencing persistent bloody diarrhea. She has a DVT in her right upper extremity and is being treated with heat packs and elevation of her arm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of melena and is experiencing persistent bloody diarrhea, which may lead to further bleeding and anemia.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and she is at risk for further hypertension complications, such as cardiac issues or stroke.
3. DVT: The patient has a DVT in her right upper extremity, which may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunosuppressed state and the presence of a rectovaginal fistula.
5. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving TPN, which may lead to malnutrition if not managed properly.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis and is at risk for further bone loss, particularly with prolonged bedrest and malnutrition.
7. Thyroid issues: The patient has hypothyroidism and is at risk for further thyroid complications, particularly if her medication is not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and anemia, and consider transfusing her as necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's DVT with heat packs and elevation of her arm, and consider anticoagulation therapy once the bleeding has resolved.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and consider antibiotics if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's malnutrition with TPN, and consider enteral nutrition if possible.
6. Continue to manage the patient's osteoporosis with outpatient medication, and consider bisphosphonates if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's thyroid issues with outpatient medication, and consider adjusting her medication as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female admit with ""blood diarrhea"" in the setting of difficult to
   control Crohn's disease.  She has had continued bleeding with
   evaluation showing source at IC junction with bleeding scan but
   negative angio and colonscopy to try to identify treatable new acute
   source of bleeding.  She has had diffuse ulcerative disease as perhaps
   most likely explanation--encouraging is the she has had no further
   acute bleeding but does retain continued slow blood loss.
   GI Bleed-
   -Patient without bowel movements since colonscopy
   -Will follow HCT q 6 hours today to assure stability

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed, specifically blood diarrhea, in the setting of difficult-to-control Crohn's disease. She has undergone colonoscopy, angio, and bleeding scan to identify the source of bleeding, with no acute source identified. She has had diffuse ulcerative disease, and her bleeding has slowed but not stopped. The patient has been receiving PPI and antibiotics, and her blood products have been stable. She has been receiving TPN and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's bleeding has slowed but not stopped, and there is a risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, or even death.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for an acute course, but there is still a risk of infection, particularly with the prolonged use of antibiotics and the patient's underlying Crohn's disease.
3. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving TPN, but there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin and mineral deficiencies, if the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism and will need to transition to oral dosing of synthroid.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and will need to be monitored for signs of deep vein thrombosis.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and will need to return to outpatient medications and have her blood pressure monitored.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying disease and the use of respiratory support.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications, particularly arrhythmias, due to her underlying disease and the use of medications.
9. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications, particularly seizures, due to her underlying disease and the use of medications.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, undergoing Humira induction, and presenting with a refractory flare, RUE DVT, and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through a rectovaginal fistula. She has an acute blood loss anemia and has undergone an EGD and angiogram without identifying an active source of bleeding. She is currently being managed with TPN, steroids, and anti-diarrheal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing bloody diarrhea and rectovaginal fistula increase the risk of further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy, and other complications.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's persistent bleeding and anemia could lead to hypovolemic shock, which could be exacerbated by the patient's hypertension.
3. DVT extension: The patient's RUE DVT could extend proximally or distally, leading to increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis could worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of fractures and other complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding could lead to gastrointestinal complications such as perforation, obstruction, or abscesses.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing bleeding could increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to tolerate food orally and reliance on TPN could lead to malnutrition and related complications.
9. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension could lead to end-organ damage, including cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular complications.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient's ongoing bleeding and anemia could lead to coagulopathy, which could exacerbate bleeding complications."

   61F w/ ongoing Crohn's flare refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira
   induction, with RUE DVT and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through
   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Crohn's disease wtih intermittant
   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - Repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  No melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; stable at this time.  Patient is still hemodynamically
   stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - Repeat HCT this PM; d/w GI whether any other studies necessary; seems
   to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to evaluate for
   small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H. No
   further imaging studies for now per GI.
   - Patient restarted on home PO meds including supplements.
   - Given a dose of MTX per GI.  Also recently started on Humira- got 2
   doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - Restarted on PO levothyroxine yesterday as patient is tolerating POs.
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient.  Were holding
   anti-hypertensives in the setting of large GI bleed. Restarted
   antihypertensives yesterday morning as patient was persistently
   hypertensive.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Can uptitrate PO meds today if necessary
   # Osteoporosis: On Alendronate q Sunday and vitamin D/Calcium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with refractory Crohn's disease who presented with acute blood loss anemia due to a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has been experiencing persistent bloody diarrhea and was found to have a rectovaginal fistula. Despite undergoing an endoscopy and angiogram, the source of the bleeding remains unknown. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) levels have been trending down, and she has been transfused with blood products. She is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been restarted on her home medications, including supplements. She has also been started on infliximab (Humira) induction therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleed is a significant concern, and further bleeding can lead to hemodynamic instability, hypovolemic shock, and even death.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, and further transfusions may be necessary to maintain her hemoglobin levels.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to Crohn's disease and her recent antibiotic use increases her risk of infection.
4. DVT: The patient has a recent history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if her levothyroxine dose is not adjusted properly.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not adequately controlled, leading to cardiovascular complications.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of fractures.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition due to her GI disease and lack of oral intake may lead to further complications, such as impaired wound healing and increased risk of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and transfuse as necessary to maintain a safe level.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotic regimen to minimize the risk of infection.
3. Monitor the patient's DVT and consider anticoagulation therapy once the GI bleed has resolved.
4. Adjust the patient's levothyroxine dose to ensure proper thyroid hormone replacement.
5. Monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust her antihypertensive medications as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's osteoporosis with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
7. Consider further imaging studies, such as capsule endoscopy, to evaluate for small bowel AVMs or other sources of bleeding.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider enteral nutrition if necessary."
