You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and recent pseudomonas bacteremia. She presented with nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory failure, and has been diagnosed with a right anterior MCA infarct, likely cardioembolic in origin. The patient's family has elected not to pursue aggressive care, but rather comfort care.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9, indicating a moderate to severe level of impairment. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg.

The patient has a history of stroke, with a previous CT scan demonstrating a midline shift and a high risk of herniation. She is at high risk for hemorrhagic transformation, and Coumadin has been held for 5-10 days. The patient's right upper extremity has a palpable radial and ulnar pulse, but anticoagulation is not possible due to the risk of hemorrhage.

The patient's rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and her rate has been lowered to 80-100 beats per minute. Her blood pressure is currently controlled, but she is at risk for hypotension and hypothermia.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. Her urine output is decreased, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal and embolic causes. She is also hypothyroid, and is receiving levothyroxine.

The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as she has failed speech and swallow, and is currently NPO. Her family does not want a nasogastric tube placed for nutrition, and will wait to see how she does before considering further interventions.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she will be treated with no aggressive measures. Her family has been contacted and informed of her condition and treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic transformation: The patient is at high risk for hemorrhagic transformation due to her recent stroke and the use of anticoagulation.
2. Hypotension and hypothermia: The patient is at risk for hypotension and hypothermia due to her recent stroke and the use of vasopressors.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is a concern, and she may require further interventions to manage her renal function.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may require further treatment and monitoring.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's failure to thrive and her inability to take oral medications and fluids may lead to nutritional deficiencies if not addressed.
6. Infection: The patient's recent bacteremia and her current respiratory failure make her at risk for further infections.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   89 year old woman with hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
   aortic stenosis, recent pseudomonas bacteremia, presenting with nausea,
   vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical
   condition. [**2121-10-24**] patient experienced R anterior MCA infarct.
   .
   # STROKE: CTA with perfusion prelim report demonstrates right
   hemispheric infarct of the anterior middle cerebral artery
   distribution. Occlusion of the intracranial right internal carotid
   artery. Most likely cardioembolic related to A Fib. Neurology Stroke
   service following and appreciate recommendations.
   - Continue ASA 325mg daily
   - Coumadin should be held for 5-10 days due to high risk of hemorrhagic
   transformation
   - CT scan demonstrates R hemisphere mass effect R lateral ventricle and
   4 mm leftward shift midline structures - discuss with neuro
   - Allow BP autoregulation - Keep SBP < 220
   - Tight glycemic control and maintain T < 100.5
   .
   # Right upper extremity arterial clot: Palpable radial pulse. Physical
   exam mildly improved since yesterday. No urgent need to embolectomy
   which would require general anesthesia. Can not anticoagulate due to
   acute stroke and high risk of hemorrhage
   - Vascular surgery following and appreciate recommendations
   - Continue to follow with exam
   .
   # Rhythm: Currently in A Fib with RVR.
   -- Continue Esmolol ggt for RVR Goal HR 100-120 with SBP not < 150 in
   setting of acute stroke.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION / HYPOTHERMIA: Resolved, etiology most likely sepsis.
   Patient currently hypertensive in setting of acute stroke. Tmax 99.8,
   WBC 14.7.
   -- Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn, per ID continue Cipro
   -- urine culture final no growth
   -- blood culture no growth so far
   .
   # URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Final urine culture no growth.
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: improving, currently 0.9. Decreased
   urine output, differential includes pre-renal vs. embolic. Continue to
   monitor.
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   .
   #FEN: Failed speech and swallow. NPO including meds and ice chips.
   Currently on IV meds. Patient's family discussed wishes not to have NG
   placed for nutrition. Confirm with family can feed patient in setting
   of high aspiration risk.
   .
   #Code: DNR/DNI. Palliative care spoke with family yesterday. Family
   expressed comfort oriented care. Need to discuss with family specific
   medications and there continuation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and recent pseudomonas bacteremia. She is currently in critical condition with respiratory failure, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and hypotension.

The patient has experienced a right anterior MCA infarct, which is likely cardioembolic related to her atrial fibrillation. She has a right upper extremity arterial clot, but it is not urgent to perform an embolectomy due to the high risk of hemorrhage. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with esmolol to control her heart rate.

The patient has a history of acute kidney injury, which is improving, but she still requires close monitoring. She has also experienced hypothyroidism, which is being treated with levothyroxine. The patient has failed speech and swallow, and her family has chosen not to place a nasogastric tube for nutrition. She is currently receiving IV medications and will need to be fed in the setting of high aspiration risk.

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) order, and her family has expressed comfort-oriented care. The patient's family has been spoken with regarding specific medications and their continuation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke: The patient's atrial fibrillation and high risk of hemorrhage make her susceptible to hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke.
2. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and respiratory failure make her susceptible to sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if she experiences further dehydration or inadequate treatment.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's failure to pass a speech and swallow evaluation and her high aspiration risk make her susceptible to aspiration pneumonia.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response make her susceptible to other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if she is not adequately treated with levothyroxine.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and bacteremia make her susceptible to pneumonia.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."
