   pleural effusion.  No CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line, but will be in touch with renal re: speciation.
   -cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - Will hold off on abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or
   obstruction though patient is s/p cholecystectomy given down trending
   LFT
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) Coagulopathy: Pt coagulopathic with INR 1.6 and bleeding from line
   sites.  Likely from liver failure.  Will give 2mg PO vit K and follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with 2 days of onset of dyspnea and fever.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 65 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/32 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient is on non-invasive ventilation with a nasal cannula and is receiving oxygen at 50% FiO2. He has a right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity on chest X-ray, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.9%
* Platelet count: 190 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are as follows:
	+ PT/PTT/INR: 18.2/32.2/1.6
	+ ALT/AST: 18/21
	+ Alkaline phosphatase/T bilirubin: 149/1.3
	+ Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
	+ LDH: 174 IU/L
	+ Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
	+ Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
	+ Phosphate: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

* Fever: possible etiology includes pneumonia, bacteremia, or abdominal source
* Hypoxia: patient on oxygen therapy, but no clear evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray
* Hypotension: patient became hypotensive during the night, possibly due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock
* PVD: patient has a history of PVD and is at risk for further complications
* ESRD on HD: patient needs HD today and has hyperkalemia without ECG changes
* CAD s/p CABG: patient has a history of CAD and CABG, and is at risk for further complications
* Cirrhosis: patient has cirrhosis thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis, and has AMS today of unclear cause
* Coagulopathy: patient is coagulopathic with an INR of 1.6 and bleeding from line sites, likely due to liver failure

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for HAP and possible legionella
* Trend LFTs
* Hold off on abdominal US to evaluate for cholelithiasis or obstruction
* Consider chest CT if no improvement
* BiPAP for now, wean as tolerated
* Check ABG
* Continue fluid boluses to a maximum of 2.5L
* Start levophed and titrate to MAP >45
* Continue clopidogrel and ASA
* Monitor pulses
* Wound care consult for LE ulcers
* Continue nephrocaps
* Continue ASA and b-blocker
* Consider diagnostic para for SBP
* Give 2mg PO vit K and follow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77 kg individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They were started on non-invasive ventilation and dialysis catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 84/32 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a Vt of 250 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 190 K/uL. Their renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 31 mEq/L. The patient's liver function is also abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 21 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 18 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may progress, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infection.
3. Infection: The patient's impaired immune function and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing a hospital-acquired infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase their risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and impaired gut function may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's impaired gut function and prolonged use of anticoagulants may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Sepsis: The patient's impaired immune function and prolonged hospitalization may increase their risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death."

   CXR: [**2118-5-20**]
   Somewhat limited study due to patient position and respiratory motion.
   Persitent right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, possibly
   representing atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded.  Small left
   pleural effusion.  No CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or obstruction given elevated
   t.bili though patient is s/p cholecystectomy
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or obstruction given elevated
   t.bili though patient is s/p cholecystectomy
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD, and afib, who presented with 2 days of dyspnea and fever in the ER. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation and dialysis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 65 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/32 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 12.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 190 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results: PT/PTT/INR: 18.2/32.2/1.6, ALT/AST: 18/21, Alk Phos/T Bili: 149/1.3, Albumin: 3.0 g/dL, LDH: 174 IU/L, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results are:

* CXR: The CXR is somewhat limited due to patient position and respiratory motion. There is a persistent right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, possibly representing atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded. There is also a small left pleural effusion. No CHF is noted.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Fever: The patient has a possible etiology of pneumonia, bacteremia, or abdominal source. Blood cultures grew gm+ cocci in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture. The patient will continue to receive vancomycin, Zosyn, and azithromycin for HAP and possible legionella.
* Hypoxia: The patient is on O2 via NC. No clear convincing evidence of PNA is noted on CXR, but it could be infectious, volume overload, or PE.
* Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive during the night with pressures in the 80s/30s, which were transiently responsive to fluid initially and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses. The patient has an HD catheter in place, which can be utilized as temporary access if needed.
* PVD: The patient has s/p angio and was discharged on [**5-13**]. The patient will continue to receive clopidogrel and ASA.
* ESRD on HD: The patient needs HD today. The patient will continue to receive nephrocaps.
* CAD s/p CABG: The patient is currently CP-free. The patient will continue to receive ASA and b-blocker.
* Cirrhosis: The patient has AMS today of unclear cause. The patient will receive lactulose for BMs and will continue to receive rifaximin.
* F/E/N: The patient is NPO for now while on BiPAP. The patient's lytes will be repleted as needed.
* PPx: The patient will receive hep sc and PPI.
* Contact: The patient's wife has been notified.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis from pneumonia or bacteremia
* Respiratory failure from pneumonia or atelectasis
* Cardiac arrest from hypotension or cardiogenic shock
* Renal failure from inadequate dialysis or volume overload
* Gastrointestinal bleeding from cirrhosis or stress ulcer
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism from PVD
* Infection from HD catheter or other lines
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia from inadequate glycemic control

The patient's care plan should include close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and radiology results, as well as prompt treatment of any complications that arise."

   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea
   - blood cx, sputum culture
   - check viral DFA
   - droplet precautions
   - trend LFTs
   - abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or obstruction given elevated
   t.bili though patient is s/p cholecystectomy
   2) Hypoxia: currently on BiPAP to keep sats up.  No evidence of PNA on
   CXR buy may be poor film.  Could be infectious, volume overload given
   need for HD, PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture, viral DFA
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   4) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   5) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   6) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   7) F/E/N: NPO for now while on BiPAP; replete lytes PRN
   8) PPx: hep sc, PPI
   9) Access: PIVs
   10) DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient and wife

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD) placement, and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented to the emergency room with 2 days of onset of dyspnea and fever.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD)
* Hypoxia, currently managed with BiPAP
* Fever, possible etiologies include pneumonia (PNA), bacteremia, abdominal source, and unlikely urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Hypotension, managed with boluses of vasopressors
* Hyperkalemia, managed with renal recommendations and nephrocaps
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), managed with lactulose and rifaximin
* Abnormal electrolyte levels, managed with repletion as needed
* Abnormal blood glucose levels, managed with glycemic control
* Abnormal coagulation profile, managed with prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed properly
* Sepsis, which may develop if the patient's fever and hypotension are not adequately managed
* Renal failure, which may worsen if the patient's hyperkalemia is not managed properly
* Liver failure, which may develop if the patient's abnormal LFTs are not managed properly
* Cardiac arrhythmias, which may develop if the patient's atrial fibrillation is not managed properly
* Infection, which may develop if the patient's abnormal white blood cell count and fever are not managed properly
* Bleeding, which may develop if the patient's abnormal coagulation profile is not managed properly

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with frequent assessments of his respiratory, renal, and cardiac status."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including bacteremia, respiratory failure, and end-stage renal disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy, with a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of bacteremia, with a white blood cell count of 12.1 and a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL. Their renal function is severely impaired, with a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. They also have a history of diabetes, with a blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showing a pH of 7.28 and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 28 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical illness, with no assessment of their peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status.

The patient's laboratory results also show evidence of liver dysfunction, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Their albumin level is 3.0 g/dL, indicating malnutrition.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated white blood cell count suggest a high risk of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk of developing respiratory failure due to their underlying lung disease.
3. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) puts them at high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of their renal function.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest liver dysfunction, which may worsen their overall condition.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's low albumin level indicates malnutrition, which may impair their immune function and increase their risk of complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the potential medical complications, and the patient's code status, the plan of care should focus on managing their bacteremia, respiratory failure, and renal failure, while also addressing their malnutrition and liver dysfunction."

   Echo ([**5-21**])The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8-cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
   filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a moderate sized (1.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears loculated.
   IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction
   and elevated filling pressures. Dilated right ventricle. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate sized loculated pericardial effusion
   located posterior to the inferior wall.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s/p CABG, s/p PPM/ICD
   placement, afib who presents with 2 days onset of dyspnea and fever in
   ER.
   1) Fever:
   - 2 blood cultures growing out GPC
 one has been speciated at coag+
   staph aureus
   - echo showed no evidence of endocarditis
   - cont vanco/zosyn
   - f/u remaining cultures (including catheter tip)
   - trend LFTs
   - dialysis catheter tip pulled yesterday.
   - on vanc and rifaximin
 vanc level 8.1
 renal recommends giving 1gm
   vanc IV
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.
   - continue to check ABG
   - improved, per pt
   - possibly get a PA and lateral chest film today to better evaluate for
   an infiltrate
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) Coagulopathy: Pt coagulopathic with INR 1.6 and bleeding from line
   sites.  Likely from liver failure.  Will give 2mg PO vit K and follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* White blood cell count: 12.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 190 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL

The patient's echocardiogram shows:

* Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures
* Dilated right ventricle
* Moderate pulmonary hypertension
* Severe aortic stenosis
* Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation
* Moderate-sized loculated pericardial effusion located posterior to the inferior wall

The patient's clinical status is:

* Fever: The patient has a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F) and is receiving antibiotics for treatment.
* Hypoxia: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has improved oxygen saturation.
* Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is thought to be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock. The patient is receiving levophed and fluid boluses.
* PVD: The patient has a history of PVD and is receiving clopidogrel and aspirin.
* ESRD on HD: The patient is in need of HD today and has hyperkalemia without ECG changes.
* CAD s/p CABG: The patient has a history of CAD and CABG and is receiving aspirin and beta-blocker therapy.
* Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis and is receiving lactulose and rifaximin.
* Coagulopathy: The patient is coagulopathic with an INR of 1.6 and is receiving vitamin K therapy.

   Echo ([**5-21**])The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8-cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
   filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a moderate sized (1.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears loculated.
   IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction
   and elevated filling pressures. Dilated right ventricle. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate sized loculated pericardial effusion
   located posterior to the inferior wall.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and rifaximin for his bacteremia. He is also being treated for hypoxia with oxygen therapy and is being monitored for hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia can progress to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Endocarditis: Although the echocardiogram did not show evidence of endocarditis, the patient's bacteremia can still lead to endocarditis, especially if the infection is not adequately treated.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory rate can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe diastolic dysfunction, and elevated filling pressures can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD and ongoing bacteremia can lead to worsening renal function and even acute kidney injury.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.4 and the presence of bacteremia can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's cirrhosis and bacteremia can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or abscesses.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and improve his outcomes."

   Echo ([**5-21**])The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8-cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
   filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a moderate sized (1.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears loculated.
   IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction
   and elevated filling pressures. Dilated right ventricle. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate sized loculated pericardial effusion
   located posterior to the inferior wall.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension (HTN), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a 2-day history of dyspnea and fever. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. The patient's blood cultures grew out GPC, coag+ Staph aureus. The echocardiogram shows moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe diastolic dysfunction, and elevated filling pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is likely caused by the dialysis catheter, which was pulled yesterday. Further monitoring is required to ensure the infection is controlled.
2. Endocarditis: Although the echocardiogram did not show any evidence of endocarditis, the patient's history of CAD and ICD placement makes it a potential complication.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis and severe diastolic dysfunction may lead to cardiac failure, which requires close monitoring.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension may lead to respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring.
5. Pericardial effusion: The patient's moderate-sized loculated pericardial effusion may require further evaluation and management.
6. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD on HD may worsen due to the infection and cardiac complications, which requires close monitoring of renal function.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.4 may increase the risk of bleeding, which requires close monitoring.
8. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which requires close monitoring.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status (AMS) may be related to the infection, cardiac complications, or hepatic dysfunction, which requires close monitoring.
10. Vascular complications: The patient's PVD may lead to vascular complications, such as peripheral artery occlusion or embolism, which requires close monitoring."

   Echo ([**5-21**])The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
   atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on
   the aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8-cm2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
   vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
   filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a moderate sized (1.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
   The effusion appears loculated.
   IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Moderate
   global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction
   and elevated filling pressures. Dilated right ventricle. Moderate
   pulmonary hypertension. Severe aortic stenosis. Moderate to severe
   tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate sized loculated pericardial effusion
   located posterior to the inferior wall.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He presented to the emergency department (ER) with two days of onset of dyspnea and fever.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is somnolent but arousable and oriented x3.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 12.1
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 190
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 16.1/31.9/1.4, ALT/AST: 18/25, Alk Phos/TBili: 160/1.0, Albumin: 3.0 g/dL, LDH: 206 IU/L, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 4.2 mg/dL

The patient's echocardiogram shows:

* Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures
* Dilated right ventricle
* Moderate pulmonary hypertension
* Severe aortic stenosis
* Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation
* Moderate-sized loculated pericardial effusion located posterior to the inferior wall

The patient has a history of bacteremia, with two blood cultures growing out Gram-positive cocci (GPC), one of which has been speciated as coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is receiving vancomycin (Vanc) and will continue to receive it.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Endocarditis, despite the patient's echocardiogram showing no evidence of endocarditis
* Sepsis, given the patient's bacteremia and fever
* Respiratory failure, given the patient's hypoxia and need for oxygen therapy
* Cardiac failure, given the patient's moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis and severe diastolic dysfunction
* Renal failure, given the patient's ESRD and need for hemodialysis
* Coagulopathy, given the patient's elevated INR and need for continued monitoring
* Wound complications, given the patient's peripheral vascular disease and need for wound care consult
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, given the patient's history of stress ulcer and need for prophylaxis.

The patient's plan includes continued vancomycin therapy, monitoring of laboratory results, and consideration of dialysis tomorrow. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is to be transferred to the floor."

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Fever: possible etiology includes PNA given dyspnea, bacteremia
   given HD patient, abdominal source, unlikely urinary since patient does
   not make urine.  Blood cultures 1 of 2 aerobic bottles grew gm+ cocci
   in pairs and clusters from peripheral puncture on [**5-19**] @9am.  This may
   represent contaminant as the most likely source would be expected to be
   the HD line, but will be in touch with renal re: speciation.
   -cont vanco/zosyn/azithro for HAP and possible legionella given fevers
   and dyspnea and inability to clearly view lung fields [**12-20**] to ICD
   (bilat) obscuring film.
   - blood cx (as above), sputum culture
   - trend LFTs
   - Will hold off on abdominal US to eval for cholelithiasis or
   obstruction though patient is s/p cholecystectomy given down trending
   LFT
   2) Hypoxia: Pt on O2 via NC.  No clear convincing evidence of PNA on
   CXR but as stated above film of limited utility.  Could be infectious,
   volume overload given need for HD or PE though less likely.
   - HD per renal for volume removal
   - antibiotics as above
   - sputum culture
   - consider chest CT if no improvement
   - BiPAP for now; wean as tolerated.  DNR/DNI confirmed
   - check ABG
   3) Hypotension:  Pt became hypotensive during the night with pressures
   in the 80
s/30
s which were transiently responsive to fluid initially
   and then became unresponsive to repeated fluid boluses (thought small
   at only 250cc at a time).  Pt has HD catheter in place R subclavian
   which can be utilized as temporary access if need for immediate
   pressors.  Would prefer to have new independent line for pressor.
   Hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, cardiogenic
   shock.
   - Continue fluid boluses to a max of volume removed at HD yesterday
   (2.5L)
   - Start levophed and titrate to MAP>45
   4) PVD: s/p angio by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9494**], discharged [**5-13**]
   - vascular to f/u patient
   - cont clopidogrel/ASA
   - monitor pulses
   - wound care consult for LE ulcers
   5) ESRD on HD: needs HD today. also with hyperkalemia without ECG
   changes
   - renal recs
   - cont nephrocaps
   6) CAD s/p CABG: CP free currently. no ECG changes. unlikely hypoxia to
   be secondary to ischemic event without symptoms or ECG changes
   - cont ASA
   - cont b-blocker
   7) Cirrhosis: thought to be secondary to steatohepatitis.  has AMS
   today of unclear cause per ER, but per wife, patient has had normal
   mental status and currently is completely clear.
   - ABG as above
   - lactulose for BMs; cont rifaximin
   - treat infection as above
   - consider diagnostic para for SBP
   8) Coagulopathy: Pt coagulopathic with INR 1.6 and bleeding from line
   sites.  Likely from liver failure.  Will give 2mg PO vit K and follow.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) for chronic kidney disease. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), cirrhosis secondary to steatohepatitis, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing fever, hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which may represent a contaminant or a source of bacteremia.

The patient's physical examination is significant for bilateral lower extremity (LE) ulcers, and the patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bacteremia and sepsis: The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a source of bacteremia. The patient's fever, hypotension, and coagulopathy suggest that the patient may be developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and the patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.28, which is slightly acidic. The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, volume overload, or PE.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to fluid reduction at HD, infection, or cardiogenic shock. The patient's MAP is currently below 45, which is a concern.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 1.6, which is elevated. The patient's bleeding from line sites may be due to liver failure.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and liver failure may be causing hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by altered mental status and confusion.
6. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The patient's PVD and immobility make the patient at risk for developing DVT and PE.
7. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest that the patient may be developing an infection. The patient's blood cultures and sputum culture should be monitored to identify the source of the infection.

The patient's care plan should focus on treating the patient's infections, managing the patient's hypotension and coagulopathy, and preventing further complications such as DVT and PE."
