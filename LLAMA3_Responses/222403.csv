Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD, presenting with shortness of breath and somnolence for three days. The patient has been treated with bipap, nebs, and solumedrol, and is currently receiving cardiac diet and cardiac medications. He has a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg and a pulmonary artery pressure of 25 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered wheezes and rales at the right base, and his chest x-ray shows volume overload. His laboratory results show a BNP of 2600, indicating cardiac decompensation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and respiratory acidosis may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
2. Cardiac decompensation: The patient's CHF and volume overload may worsen, leading to cardiac decompensation and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent antibiotics may increase his risk of infection.
4. Delirium: The patient's hypercarbic state and steroid use may exacerbate his delirium, which can lead to increased risk of falls and other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's cardiac diet and medications may lead to electrolyte imbalance, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and hypercoagulable state may increase his risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating that he does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the event of cardiac arrest."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour admission to the ICU with a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is being ventilated with a Venti mask and is receiving oxygen therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F (36.7°C), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 40% FiO2. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and their tidal volume is 441 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.31, bicarbonate level of 80 mmol/L, and lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to their underlying COPD and acute exacerbation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases their risk of developing VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may indicate the presence of sepsis.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD and the use of mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing ARDS.
5. Pneumothorax: The patient's underlying COPD and the use of mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing a pneumothorax.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's underlying COPD and the use of mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing cardiac arrest.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing a DVT due to their immobility and the use of heparin prophylaxis.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing a stress ulcer due to their underlying COPD and the use of mechanical ventilation.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition is being managed, but they are at risk for malnutrition due to their underlying COPD and the use of mechanical ventilation.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's underlying COPD and the use of mechanical ventilation may cause psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The patient presents with Shortness of Breath (SOB) and somnulence for three days.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98°F, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a venti mask.

The patient's respiratory support includes continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 80 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 174 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for scattered wheezes and rales at the right base of the lung, and the patient is alert but confused and speaking only Farsi.

The patient's laboratory results show a carbon dioxide (CO2) level of 42 mmHg, and an lactic acid level of 0.9 mmol/L. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows volume overload.

The patient's medications include:

* Solumedrol 80 IV tid for hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Nebulizers for bronchodilation
* BIPAP for respiratory support
* Lasix 80 mg PO daily for CHF
* Metoprolol daily for CHF
* Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia
* Abilify, risperdal, and artane for delirium
* Haldol PRN for delirium
* Restraints for patient safety

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD exacerbation
* Cardiac failure due to volume overload and CHF
* Delirium due to hypercarbia and steroids
* Infection due to recent PNA and potential consolidation on CXR
* Anemia due to ongoing bleeding and lack of adequate iron supplementation
* Electrolyte imbalance due to autodiuresis and diuretic therapy
* Worsening of COPD exacerbation due to inadequate treatment and management.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to adjust treatment and management accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted with shortness of breath and somnolence. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has been treated with bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP). The patient's delirium has been managed with antipsychotics and sedatives. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and they are receiving cardiac diet. The patient's anemia is being treated with iron supplements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's COPD exacerbation and hypercarbic respiratory failure may increase the risk of pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection may progress to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's CHF and electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, leading to increased agitation and confusion.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
8. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis and other complications.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's CHF and electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Renal Failure: The patient's CHF and electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of renal failure."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of agitation, which was effectively managed with zyprexa and haldol. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema with an acute exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 159/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total intake of 580 mL and a total output of 4,505 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion may be a sign of delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as medication, infection, or underlying medical conditions. Delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, respiratory complications, and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD may lead to respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's age and underlying medical conditions. Respiratory failure can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fluid balance and laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
4. Bleeding Risk: The patient's platelet count is 182, which is slightly low. The patient is also receiving heparin prophylaxis, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of omeprazole (Prilosec) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of chronic use and underlying medical conditions.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 270, which is slightly elevated. The patient is receiving nutrition support, which may not be adequate to manage hyperglycemia.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results suggest the possibility of electrolyte imbalance, particularly with regards to potassium and sodium levels. Electrolyte imbalance can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has been receiving treatment with bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP), steroids, and other medications. His condition has been stable, with improvements in oxygenation and ventilation. However, he remains at risk for complications such as delirium, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to the hypercarbic environment and the use of steroids.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the underlying COPD and CHF, which could lead to respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's CHF and COPD may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of chronic illnesses may increase his risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's CHF and COPD may lead to fluid overload, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and steroids may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to his underlying chronic illnesses and the use of anticoagulants.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and anticoagulants may lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
9. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's CHF and COPD may increase his risk of developing renal insufficiency.
10. Cardiovascular Collapse: The patient's underlying CHF and COPD may lead to cardiovascular collapse, which could be life-threatening."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted with acute exacerbation of COPD and somnulence. The patient has been receiving oxygen therapy, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and steroids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 159/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 94% and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's PaCO2 level of 38 mmHg indicates hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Volume Overload: The patient's CXR shows volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is exacerbated by hypercarbia and steroids, and may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT level of 26% indicates anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues if not managed properly.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and underlying medical conditions, and prophylactic heparin therapy is being administered.
6. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, and prophylactic antibiotics are being administered.
7. CHF: The patient's CHF is worsening, and further management is needed to improve cardiac function and reduce symptoms.
8. DM2: The patient's DM2 is not well-controlled, and further management is needed to improve glucose control and reduce the risk of complications.
9. HL: The patient's HL is not well-controlled, and further management is needed to improve lipid levels and reduce the risk of complications.
10. FEN: The patient's FEN is not well-controlled, and further management is needed to improve electrolyte levels and reduce the risk of complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of COPD, OSA/OHV, and schizophrenia. She was admitted with acute on chronic hypercarbic failure due to COPD exacerbation and volume overload. The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and has been treated with various medications, including lasix, alb/atrov nebs, advair, and solumedrol. She has also been receiving oxygen therapy and has been monitored for potential complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/48 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93%. Her neurological examination is normal, with no signs of sedation or paralysis.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is 7.2 K/uL, and her platelet count is 182 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 27.8 mg/dL, and her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and volume overload put her at risk for respiratory failure, which could lead to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension could indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or acute coronary syndrome.
3. Infection: The patient's increased white blood cell count and fever could indicate an infection, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of sepsis.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion could be a sign of delirium, which could be caused by her underlying schizophrenia, steroids, or other medications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and her use of anticoagulant medications put her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Worsening COPD: The patient's COPD exacerbation could worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and decreased oxygen saturation.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and electrolyte supplements could lead to electrolyte imbalance, which could worsen her cardiac status and increase her risk of arrhythmias.
8. Inadequate pain management: The patient's use of opioids and other pain medications could lead to inadequate pain management, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of respiratory failure."

   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - continue BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**5-4**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%
   .
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in
   [**2132-4-30**].
   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   - repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   Responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously, well to 2.5mg tonight.
   - hold Ultram, Rozerem, diphenhydramine
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Zyprexa prn for sundowning
   - restraints as needed
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - continue home glyburide

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - continue BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**5-4**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%
   .
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in
   [**2132-4-30**].
   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os

   - repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   Responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously, well to 2.5mg tonight.
   - hold Ultram, Rozerem, diphenhydramine
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues can arise:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's carbon dioxide levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This may require continued BiPAP therapy and weaning of steroids.
2. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest an exacerbation of COPD, but the precipitant is unclear. Further workup with CTA may be necessary to rule out underlying pulmonary embolism.
3. Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: The patient's CXR shows persistent cardiomegaly, and her BNP levels are elevated. This may indicate ongoing heart failure, which requires close monitoring and diuresis as needed.
4. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia, steroids, and underlying schizophrenia. Further management with antipsychotics and sedatives may be necessary.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, requiring continued management with insulin and close monitoring.
6. Constipation: The patient's bowel habits are not well-documented, but it is noted that she has been prescribed a bowel regimen.
7. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are stable but may require further monitoring.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid medication is stable, but further monitoring may be necessary.
9. FEN (Fever, Electrolyte imbalance, and Nutritional deficiencies): The patient's electrolytes are replete, but further monitoring may be necessary to ensure nutritional adequacy.
10. Potential aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration is increased due to her respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and management.

In terms of potential issues, the following may arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring further interventions such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure may worsen, requiring further diuresis and cardiac medications.
3. Infection: The patient's risk of infection is increased due to her respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status may worsen due to her respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and management.
5. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration may increase due to her respiratory failure and may require further evaluation and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - continue BiPAP at night per home settings

   -sleep c/s, awaiting recs
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.

   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in

   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF, admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially transferred to the floor on 4L O2 but was readmitted to the MICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia. Her current vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.1°C (97°F)
* HR: 83 bpm (58-105 bpm)
* BP: 134/43 mmHg (66-159/78 mmHg)
* RR: 20 inspirations per minute (10-26)
* SpO2: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Genital-PT confused, speaking nonsense
* HEENT-supple, no JVD, no LN
* CV-s1/s2 no MGR
* Pulm-coarse BS anteriorly b/l, no wheeze
* Abd-obese, soft, NTND
* Ext-b/l LE edema, [**Last Name (un) 307**] DP pulses

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 7.2-7.6 K/uL
* Hct: 28.3-33.6%
* Plt: 182-253
* Cr: 0.8-1.0
* TCO2: 42-54
* Glucose: 19
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Differential-Neuts, Lymph, Mono, Eos, Lactic Acid, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, PO4

Medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation, but the underlying precipitant is unclear. Further workup is needed to rule out an underlying PE.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: The patient's CXR shows persistent cardiomegaly, but improved pulmonary edema, suggesting euvolemia. However, her BNP was 2600 on admission, indicating cardiac strain.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation is likely multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids. Further management is needed to address this symptom.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, likely exacerbated by high-dose steroids. Tight glycemic control is necessary to prevent complications.
5. Constipation: The patient's constipation is likely due to her underlying medical conditions and medications. Further management is needed to address this symptom.
6. Delirium/confusion: The patient's confusion and disorientation are likely due to her underlying medical conditions and medications. Further management is needed to address this symptom.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest a possible underlying respiratory infection.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest a possible underlying PE.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's underlying CHF and cardiac strain increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's underlying medical conditions and immunosuppressive medications increase her risk of developing infections.
5. Sepsis: The patient's underlying medical conditions and immunosuppressive medications increase her risk of developing sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   -need to review all medications and OMR.  At present, the role of each
   is not clear.  For example, is the progestin meant to be primary
   treatment for her respiratory disease?  How did her psychiatric
   medication regimen get to present state.  Ask pharmacy to help.  If
   still an issue, consider psych consult for psychopharm mgmt assistance.
   -consider sleep consult for chronic management
   -wean steroids (help wtih neuropsych sxs)
   -spoke with daughter who was concerned that pt. was not on home BiPap
   settings and wanted to know that carbon dioxide was coming down;
   someone should touch base with her every day
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure:
    Patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest
   COPD exacerbation but unclear precipitant given lack of fever,
   infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF
   and volume overload were worse from baseline and were exacerbating
   respiratory symptoms but now euvolemic with developing metabolic
   alkalosis. Given 25% of COPD exacerbaions of unclear etiology can be
   triggered by an underlying PE, will pursue further workup with CTA.CO2
   of 105 on admit ABG, improved to 80s with BiPAP. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.   Will start to wean
   steroids since likely exacerbating agitation
   - Will change solumedrol 80 IV TID to 60mg Prednisone daily in am
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
   - BiPAP at night per home settings
   - home advair
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin for 5-day course, Day [**4-3**]
   - wean O2 as tolerated to baseline to maintain sats 90%
   .
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic:
   CXR from this am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary
   edema and has had trending up bicarb likely from diuresis and
   contraction alkaslosis. Currently appears euvolemic. Patient had been
   on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold for now given
   adequate diuresis and euvolemia. Yesterday had autodiuresed -4L UOP
   over the last 24hrs. BNP was 2600 on admission, up from previous 800 in
   [**2132-4-30**].
   - Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
   - hold additional lasix for now as autodiuresing
   - follow strict I/Os
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   - repeat EKG this AM
   .
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   Responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously, well to 2.5mg tonight.
   - hold Ultram, Rozerem, diphenhydramine
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Zyprexa prn for sundowning
   - restraints as needed
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and CHF. She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred to the floor on 4L O2. However, she was readmitted to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/43 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) 7.2-7.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb) 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt) 182-253 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) 0.8-1.0 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2) 42-54 mmol/L
* Glucose 19.0 mmol/L
* Lactic acid 0.9 mmol/L
* LDH 202 IU/L
* Ca++ 10.3 mg/dL
* Mg++ 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a CO2 level of 105 on admission, which improved to the 80s with BiPAP. She has a history of COPD exacerbation, and the current exacerbation is unclear. The patient's chest X-ray shows improved pulmonary edema, and she is currently euvolemic.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic. Her BNP was 2600 on admission, up from 800 in [**2132-4-30**]. She is currently on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but it will be held for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with agitation and delirium. She has a history of schizophrenia and is currently on home Abilify, risperdal, and Artane. She has responded well to 5 mg Zyprexa previously and 2.5mg tonight.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Prednisone 60mg qd
* Azithromycin for 5-day course
* Albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2
* BiPAP at night per home settings
* Home Advair
* Lasix prn SOB, e/o volume overload
* Metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter effect)
* Aspirin
* HISS with QID fingersticks
* Home glyburide
* Home simvastatin
* Home levothyroxine

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation
* Cardiac failure due to diastolic congestive heart failure
* Hyperglycemia due to high-dose steroids and diabetes mellitus II
* Hypothyroidism due to chronic medication
* Anemia due to chronic disease and medication
* Hypertension due to chronic disease and medication
* Electrolyte imbalance due to medication and chronic disease
* Aspiration due to altered mental status and swallowing dysfunction
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility and chronic disease
* Stress ulcer due to critical illness and medication
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation
* Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) due to indwelling catheter"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has a history of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 182 x 10^9/L. Her chest X-ray shows resolving pulmonary atelectasis. She is currently receiving BiPAP therapy and has been prescribed antibiotics and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation, but the lack of fever, infiltrate, and leukocytosis makes it unclear what is causing the exacerbation. The patient's euvolemia and developing metabolic alkalosis suggest that CHF and volume overload may be worsening her respiratory symptoms.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's CXR shows persistent cardiomegaly, and her BUN is trending up, suggesting diastolic congestive heart failure. Her euvolemia and bicarbonate trending up could be in part due to contraction alkalosis.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation is likely multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids and underlying schizophrenia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus II and current hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids require close monitoring and management.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit is high 20s to low 30s, and her most recent value was 28, which is stable. However, her anemia may worsen if she does not receive adequate treatment.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is well-controlled, but it may require adjustment if her condition changes.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is not currently causing any active concerns, but it may require management if her condition worsens.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation is not currently causing any active concerns, but it may require management if her condition worsens.
9. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids and underlying schizophrenia."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]
   - Continue steroid wean
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis, but more likely due to respiratory component.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure (CHF). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure and later transferred back to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has persistent hypercarbia, and her ABG results indicate chronic respiratory acidosis with developing metabolic alkalosis.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic, with cardiomegaly on CXR and trending up BUN likely due to diuresis and contraction alkalosis.
* Neurological: The patient has agitation, likely multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids versus underlying schizophrenia.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled, but currently has hyperglycemia exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a stable hematocrit of 28%.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has constipation (obstipation, fos) and is at risk of aspiration due to her eating despite understood risk.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to persistent hypercarbia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and underlying cardiac conditions
* Sepsis or septic shock due to untreated infections
* Worsening of COPD exacerbation
* Hyperglycemic emergencies due to uncontrolled diabetes
* Gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration or gastrointestinal bleeding
* Increased risk of falls and pressure ulcers due to agitation and immobility

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing BiPAP 18/10 for sleep
* Monitoring ABGs to assess improvement
* Continuing azithromycin for 4 days
* Weaning steroids
* Restarting Depakote 250mg PO qday
* Managing agitation with risperdal prn
* Monitoring and managing hyperglycemia
* Continuing home medications, including glyburide, simvastatin, levothyroxine, and metoprolol
* Monitoring and managing electrolyte imbalances
* Providing nutrition support with nectar thickened and aspiration precautions
* Providing stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI
* Providing DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF heparin

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending transfer to the floor."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission. Most recent ABG suggests chronic repiratory acidosis with
   developing concomitant metabolic alkalosis.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to

   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.

   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis, but more likely due to respiratory component.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was transferred back to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has persistent hypercarbia, with an ABG showing a pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 86, and pO2 of 59. She is on BiPAP 18/10 and has a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic, with cardiomegaly on CXR. Her BUN is trending up, likely due to diuresis and contraction alkalosis.
* Neurological: The patient has agitation, likely multifactorial, secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, well-controlled, but is currently experiencing hyperglycemia, likely exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, with a hematocrit of 28, and is on home levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's agitation can lead to delirium, confusion, or even seizures.
* Endocrine complications: The patient's hyperglycemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, or even coma.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, or even heart failure.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent potential complications and optimize her treatment."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. Will get ABGs after changes to
   monitor improvement. Sleep is following
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - continue azithromycin, day [**4-1**]
   - Continue steroid wean. Prednisone 10mg po [**8-21**] then stop.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - Depakote and amonia levels low. Patient
s daughter stated that she
   does not take Depakote at home. Will clarify with psych if she needs to
   be on it.
   - psych following
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - Have reduced steroids and stopped zyprexa. Increased sliding scale
   and will monitor blood sugar on SSI and glyberide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially treated with BiPAP and albuterol/ipratropium nebs, but was transferred back to the ICU due to agitation and persistent hypercarbia. The patient's symptoms suggest a COPD exacerbation, but the precipitant is unclear. She has been prescribed azithromycin and is being treated with steroids, but the dosage is being weaned.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if her COPD exacerbation is not effectively managed.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's CHF may worsen if her fluid status is not closely monitored, and her heart rate and rhythm are not closely monitored.
3. Infection: The patient's lack of fever and infiltrate suggests that the precipitant of her COPD exacerbation may be a viral syndrome, but the possibility of a bacterial infection cannot be ruled out.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if her steroid dosage is not weaned properly, and her insulin sliding scale is not adjusted accordingly.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration pneumonia is increased due to her COPD exacerbation and her decision to continue eating despite the risk of aspiration.
6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if her fluid status is not closely monitored, and her electrolyte levels are not adjusted accordingly.
7. Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion may worsen if her hypercarbia is not effectively managed, and her sleep disturbances are not addressed.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if her fluid status is not closely monitored, and her bowel habits are not closely monitored.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may worsen if her diet is not closely monitored, and her simvastatin dosage is not adjusted accordingly.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her hematocrit levels are not closely monitored, and her iron levels are not adjusted accordingly."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - changes in V6 only, not consistent with myocardial injury
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - Depakote and ammonia levels low. Patient
s daughter stated that she
   does not take Depakote at home. Will clarify with psych if she needs to
   be on it.
   - psych following
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - Have reduced steroids and stopped zyprexa. Increased sliding scale
   and will monitor blood sugar on SSI and glyberide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -talk with sleep and talk with daughter concerning level of care
   necessary and most appropriate next step in care.
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG unchanged following sleep
   recs of 88-90%SaO2 o/n.
   - f/u final blood cultures
   - Continue steroid wean. stop prednisone.
   - Unclear why patient is on MedroxyPROGESTERone. Will discuss with PCP
   and consider stopping as could be worsening her OHV.
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -talk with sleep and talk with daughter concerning level of care
   necessary and most appropriate next step in care.
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and chronic heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially transferred to the floor but was readmitted to the ICU due to persistent hypercarbia and agitation. Her recent sleep study recommended BiPap at 18/10 to help blow off CO2 and improve overall lung function and mental status.

Current Vital Signs:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 73 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 115/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 85%
* SpO2: 88-90%SaO2

Labs:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 6.9, Hct 27.8, Plt 186
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 30.8 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 291 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 141 mEq/L, K 3.8 mEq/L, Cl 92 mEq/L, Mg 2.2 mg/dL, PO4 3.3 mg/dL

Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of SOB, agitation, and hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation, but the precipitant is unclear.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient's agitation and disorientation may be secondary to hypercarbia and exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
3. Diabetes mellitus II: The patient's hemoglobin A1c is 6.8, and she is currently on home glyburide and HISS.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, but it is not an active concern.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline hematocrit is high 20s to low 30s, and her most recent value is 28.
6. Hypothyroid: The patient has hypothyroidism, but it is not an active concern.
7. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which may be exacerbated by her medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may progress to respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's CHF and euvolemia may lead to cardiovascular instability if not managed properly.
3. Infection: The patient's BUN and Cr values may indicate infection, which should be investigated and managed promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's constipation and use of anticoagulants may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Worsening of COPD: The patient's COPD exacerbation may worsen if not managed effectively, leading to respiratory failure.

Plan:

1. Continue BiPap at 18/10 and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
2. Wean steroids and consider stopping MedroxyPROGESTERone to improve the patient's respiratory status.
3. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her sliding scale insulin as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's constipation and consider adding fiber supplements.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications as needed.
6. Investigate and manage any potential infections promptly.
7. Consider acetazolamide if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
8. Consult with the patient's sleep team and pulmonologist to determine the best course of care.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath (SOB), somulence, and agitation, which suggest a COPD exacerbation.
* The patient's blood gas analysis shows a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 77 mmHg, indicating hypercarbia.
* The patient's heart rate is 76 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 75/20 mmHg, indicating hypotension.
* The patient's oxygen saturation is 89%, and she is receiving supplemental oxygen through a bipap mask.
* The patient's neurological status is impaired, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic function.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbia and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CHF and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of chronic diseases may increase the risk of infection, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
* Delirium: The patient's agitation and somulence may be indicative of delirium, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
* Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen her condition and increase the risk of bowel obstruction and other complications.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen her condition and increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and other complications.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen her condition and increase the risk of hypothyroidism-related complications.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypercarbia with bipap therapy and consider acetazolamide if her respiratory status does not improve.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications as needed to manage her CHF and hypotension.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her medications as needed to manage her agitation and somulence.
* Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust her medications as needed to manage her hyperglycemia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as needed to manage her hypothyroidism.
* Consider consultation with a pulmonologist and a cardiologist to further manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   73 y/o woman with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
   presents with SOB and somulence x3 days, admitted initially to the MICU
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure, transferred to the floor on 4L O2
   now transferred back to MICU with agitation, persistent hypercarbia.
   # Hypercarbic hypoxic resp failure: Patient's symptoms of SOB,
   agitation as well as hypercarbia suggest COPD exacerbation but unclear
   precipitant given lack of fever, infiltrate, leukocytosis, viral
   syndrome. Initial thought was that CHF and volume overload were worse
   from baseline and were exacerbating respiratory symptoms but now
   euvolemic with developing metabolic alkalosis. Daughter reports
   baseline CO2 70s but per review of records had been 40s to 50s last
   admission.
   - standing albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6, with prn q2 with home advair
   - continue BiPAP 18/10 per sleep recs. ABG improved wearing BIPAP all
   night.
   - final Bcx negative.
   - Prednisone stopped
   -S/S consulted and recommended NPO, patient/family disagreed and she
   continue to eat despite understood risk of aspiration, so compromise
   was made for soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
   - if transferred to floor, will have pulm continue to follow to monitor
   care
   -watch over night to let pt equilibrate in terms of respiratory
   status.  Consider acetazolamide tomorrow if respiratory status does not
   change.  Would need art line for acetazolamide.
   # 9 beat asymptomatic Vtach: Patient at baseline has ectopic atrial
   rhythm with PVCs, no new Vtach o/n.
   - No significant electrolyte abnormalities, will replete lytes as
   needed
   - Cont tele
   # Diastolic congestive heart failure, acute on chronic: CXR from this
   am with persistent cardiomegaly but improved pulmonary edema and has
   had trending up BUN likely from diuresis and contraction alkaslosis.
   Currently appears euvolemic. Bicarb trending up could be in part from
   contraction alkalosis.
   - Patient had been on home dose of lasix 80mg PO daily, but will hold
   for now given adequate diuresis and euvolemia.
   - continue metoprolol (change XL to short acting for titration, shorter
   effect), aspirin
   # Agitation: Likely multifactorial secondary to hypercarbia and
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids vs underlying schizophrenia.
   - continue home Abilify, risperdal, Artane
   - Risperdal prn for aggitation. Per home psych Zyprexa has caused
   hyperglycemia
   - restraints as needed
   - psych following
   # Diabetes mellitus II, well-controlled. Hemoglobin A1c of 6.8 in [**Month (only) 1996**]
   [**2132**]. Currently on home glyburide and HISS given hyperglycemia
   exacerbated by high-dose steroids.
   - Have reduced steroids and stopped zyprexa. Increased sliding scale
   and will monitor blood sugar on SSI and glyberide
   - HISS with QID fingersticks
   # Hyperlipidemia. No active concerns.
   - continue home simvastatin
   # Anemia. Baseline hematocrit high 20s to low 30s. Most recent was 28
   and stable.
   - continue to trend daily hematocrit
   # Hypothyroid. No active concerns.
   - continue home levothyroxine
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, soft solids and nectar thickened
   liquids
   # Communication: with daughter and patient via phone interpreter
   # Code status: DNR/DNI (confirmed with daughter, HCP)

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially transferred to the floor but was readmitted to the ICU due to persistent hypercarbia and agitation. The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, somnulence, and hypercarbia. She has a history of COPD exacerbation, CHF, and diabetes mellitus II.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 75/20 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 89% on a bipap mask. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, but no signs of infection or inflammation. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slight elevation in bicarbonate.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus II. She is currently taking medications for COPD, CHF, and diabetes, including albuterol/ipratropium nebs, metoprolol, aspirin, glyburide, and simvastatin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, somnulence, and hypercarbia suggest a worsening of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She may require mechanical ventilation to manage her respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and her current symptoms of shortness of breath and somnulence suggest that her cardiac function may be compromised. She may require treatment for CHF, including diuretics and vasodilators.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of fever suggest that she may have an infection. She may require antibiotics and further evaluation to rule out a serious infection.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slight elevation in bicarbonate. She may require electrolyte supplementation to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus II and her current symptoms of hyperglycemia suggest that she may require treatment for hyperglycemia, including insulin and oral medications.
6. Delirium: The patient's symptoms of agitation and confusion suggest that she may be experiencing delirium. She may require treatment with antipsychotic medications and further evaluation to rule out underlying causes of delirium."
