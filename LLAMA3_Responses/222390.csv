You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old female who was admitted with a diagnosis of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent placement. She was loaded with integrelin and heparin for cardioprotection and was started on low-dose captopril for cardioprotection. She was also started on atorvastatin, ASA, Plavix, and possibly niacin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 85/59 mmHg, heart rate of 55 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her respiratory support is with a nasal cannula, and her ABG shows a pH of 7.36, pCO2 of 40 mmHg, and pO2 of 76 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals a general condition of being well-nourished and in no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, with a pulse of 2+ in all extremities. Her lung examination shows bilateral wheezing and rhonchi, and her abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 171 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 132 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and chloride level of 105 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show increased bilateral peripheral and perihilar interstitial opacities, suggestive of fluid overload, and small bilateral pleural effusions with a small amount of fluid tracking into the minor fissure. There is also evidence of atelectasis and hyperexpansion compatible with underlying chronic lung disease.

The patient's medical history includes a history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is also on long-term estrogen therapy and has a history of MGUS.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's STEMI and PCI may lead to cardiac complications such as ventricular thrombus, LV aneurysmal formation, and other mechanical complications.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's fluid overload and pleural effusions may lead to respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's hypothyroidism and MGUS may lead to neurological complications such as cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of infection.
6. Contrast allergy: The patient's risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast may lead to severe allergic reactions.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 86-year-old woman who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with a bare metal stent in the mid LAD. She experienced hypotension overnight, which improved with captopril being held. She also had an episode of choking sensation, which was likely an allergic response. The patient has maintained normal sinus rhythm and has been started on various medications, including heparin, eptifibatide, and atorvastatin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Ventricular arrhythmias:** The patient's persistent ST elevations on ECG may indicate microvascular reperfusion injury, which can increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
2. **Left ventricular aneurysmal formation:** The persistent ST elevations may also increase the risk of left ventricular aneurysmal formation, which can lead to cardiac complications.
3. **Mechanical complications:** The patient's enlarged heart size and tortuous thoracic aorta with calcified plaque may increase the risk of mechanical complications, such as cardiac tamponade or aortic dissection.
4. **Fluid overload:** The patient's increased peripheral and perihilar interstitial opacities on imaging studies suggest fluid overload, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications.
5. **Contrast allergy:** The patient has a risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast, which can lead to life-threatening reactions.
6. **Hypothyroidism:** The patient's history of long-term estrogen therapy and hypothyroidism may require close monitoring and adjustments to thyroid replacement therapy.
7. **Hypoestrogenism:** The patient's recent discontinuation of estrogen therapy may lead to hypoestrogenism, which can have various effects on the body.
8. **Pain management:** The patient's chronic pain management with Tylenol may need to be adjusted to ensure adequate pain control while minimizing the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
9. **DVT prophylaxis:** The patient's risk of DVT may require continued anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic complications.
10. **VAP prophylaxis:** The patient's risk of VAP may require continued antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's ECG for signs of ventricular arrhythmias or ST elevation resolution.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy to minimize the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely to prevent fluid overload.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust thyroid replacement therapy as needed.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's pain management regimen to ensure adequate pain control while minimizing the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
6. Continue to provide DVT prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis as indicated."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - scant bibas rales
   Heart - soft HSM
   ext no edema.
   Medical Decision Making
   86 female her with anterion STEMI s/p successful revasc with BMS. We
   will push beta blockers as BP allows. Will add warfarin to prevent
   mural thrombus. Plavix and asa mandatory for one month and out to one
   year if possible. Lipito 80 mg QD per PROVE IT TIMI 22. Hopefully the
   wall motion is myocardial stunning as CK/MB rise was moderate for the
   degree of wall motion abnormality. Will resume ACEI when BP allow. Team
   had been told to watch for increase MR murmur and free wall rupture.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed with primary
   care physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   is not an uncommon phenomenon, present in 20-50% of pts in numerous

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - scant bibas rales
   Heart - soft HSM
   ext no edema.
   Medical Decision Making
   86 female her with anterion STEMI s/p successful revasc with BMS. We
   will push beta blockers as BP allows. Will add warfarin to prevent
   mural thrombus. Plavix and asa mandatory for one month and out to one
   year if possible. Lipito 80 mg QD per PROVE IT TIMI 22. Hopefully the
   wall motion is myocardial stunning as CK/MB rise was moderate for the
   degree of wall motion abnormality. Will resume ACEI when BP allow. Team
   had been told to watch for increase MR murmur and free wall rupture.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed with primary
   care physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Persistent ST elevations on ECG may indicate poor prognosis, microvascular reperfusion injury, or increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation.
	* The patient's history of dyslipidemia and STEMI with complete occlusion of the mid LAD may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* The patient's history of chronic lung disease and hyperexpansion on imaging may increase the risk of respiratory complications.
	* The presence of bilateral peripheral and perihilar interstitial opacities, small bilateral pleural effusions, and atelectasis may indicate fluid overload or respiratory distress.
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* The patient's history of nausea and vomiting may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hematological complications:
	* The patient's history of MGUS and hypothyroidism may increase the risk of hematological complications, such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
5. Infectious complications:
	* The patient's history of recent PCI and use of heparin and integrilin may increase the risk of infectious complications, such as sepsis or endocarditis.
6. Allergic reactions:
	* The patient's history of anaphylaxis to IV contrast and risk of anaphylaxis with future contrast exposure may increase the risk of allergic reactions.
7. Endocrine complications:
	* The patient's history of hypothyroidism and hypoestrogenism may increase the risk of endocrine complications, such as thyroid storm or adrenal insufficiency.
8. Neurological complications:
	* The patient's history of intermittent PVCs and risk of arrhythmias may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of these potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   - atorvastatin 80
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]
   - will consider ACE when BP improves
   # PUMP:  Pt now s/p STEMI with worsening STE on ECG s/p intervention.
   Perisistent STE after revascularization is not an uncommon phenomenon,
   present in 20-50% of pts in numerous trials assessing this marker of
   poor prognosis,  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation, possibly
   other mechanical complications.  She also recieved IV steroids w/in 24
   hrs of STEMI, some data suggests this may possibly increase risk of
   mechanical complication.   Post infarct ECHO shows 35% and pt has
   persistent hypotension, responding minimally to fluids.  Poor
   contractility is likely the cause of hypotension.  Doing well on
   Dopamine.
   - continue Dopa, wean as tolerated
   - follow UOP and O2 sats
   - contin heparin for ventricular thrombus
   - initiated coumadin 5mg  [**11-30**], can f/u in 3 months for repeat ECHO,
   and possible d/c at that time.
   # RHYTHM: Pt has maintained nl sinus rhythm throughout, intermittent

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman who presented with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with bare metal stent placement. She has been experiencing hypotension, and her blood pressure is being managed with dopamine and beta-blockers. She has also been started on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has persistent ST-segment elevation on her ECG.

The patient has a history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She is also taking medications for her conditions, including atorvastatin, aspirin, and metoprolol. She has a history of MGUS and is being followed as an outpatient.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a supple neck, normal cardiac examination, and bibasilar rales on lung examination. Her laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, anemia, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's persistent ST-segment elevation on her ECG and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing myocardial damage. She is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin increases her risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hematuria.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be exacerbated by her ongoing bleeding and may require transfusion.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be a sign of underlying cardiac or vasculature issues and may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase her risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
6. Thrombosis: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may indicate underlying renal insufficiency, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for these potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yof w/ h/o dyslipidemia p/w SSCP and nausea, STE on ECG, and
   complete occlusion of mid LAD, s/p bare metal stent placement.
   # CORONARIES - Pt s/p  bare metal stent.   She was loaded with
   integrellin and heparin.  She was also started on low dose captopril
   for cardioprotection.  BB was deferred given risk of vasovagal response
   and bradycardia with sheath removal.  She has remained hypotensive
   while asleep, normotensive when awake.  Given low nighttime blood
   pressures evening dose of captopril was held.  Continues to have HR in
   80s-90s.  BB for HR control may have better outcomes.  Does not require
   afterload reduction at present
   - atorvastatin 80
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - will hold BB until BP improves.
   - will consider ACE when BP improves
   # PUMP:  Pt now s/p STEMI with worsening STE on ECG s/p intervention.
   Perisistent STE after revascularization is not an uncommon phenomenon,
   present in 20-50% of pts in numerous trials assessing this marker of
   poor prognosis,  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation, possibly
   other mechanical complications.  She also recieved IV steroids w/in 24
   hrs of STEMI, some data suggests this may possibly increase risk of
   mechanical complication.   Post infarct ECHO shows 35% and pt has
   persistent hypotension, responding minimally to fluids.  Poor
   contractility is likely the cause of hypotension.  Doing well on
   Dopamine.
   - continue Dopa, wean as tolerated
   - follow UOP and O2 sats
   - contin heparin for ventricular thrombus
   - initiated coumadin 5mg  [**11-30**], can f/u in 3 months for repeat ECHO,
   and possible d/c at that time.
   # RHYTHM: Pt has maintained nl sinus rhythm throughout, intermittent
   PVCs
   #Anemia
 Hct 32.  Baseline 40.  Negative 1L post cath (after being
   given IVF for renal protection prior to cath).
   -          Acute blood loss anemia, though significant blood loss not
   reported with procedure
   -          dilutional, pt received IVF prior to admission to the CCU
   -          will trend, Transfuse if Hct <27 or sx.
   -
   # Contrast allergy - Pt has risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast she
   was given for PCI.  She was pretreated with solumedrol and benadryl.
   Will have to follow for signs of anaphylaxis, including throat closing,
   hypotension.  No severe sx.  Hypotension can be attributed to this
   also, but she has been premedicated, and has no respiratory sx.
   - Loratadine prn
   # ?Hypoestrogenism - Pt on long term estrogen therapy since the late
   [**2037**].  Not needed.
   - d/c estrogen
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid
   #MGUS - stable, followed as outpt
   #L2 - L3 Laminectomy s/p growth stim, leads unable to be removed, pt
   unable to get MRI.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with a history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a recent STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) with complete occlusion of the mid-LAD (left anterior descending) artery. She underwent bare metal stent placement and was loaded with integrelin and heparin for cardioprotection.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 79-90 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 84/48 mmHg (normal range: 68-109/35-101 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 6 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 90%
* Weight: 55.8 kg (admission weight: 57.9 kg)

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 9.1-10.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 192 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9-0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 6.13-2.70 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL
* Glucose: 132-108 mg/dL

Imaging studies:

* ECG: persistent STE (ST-elevation) on the ECG, consistent with ongoing myocardial infarction
* Echo: 35% ejection fraction, consistent with poor contractility

Assessment and plan:

* The patient is at risk for mechanical complications, including ventricular thrombus and LV aneurysmal formation, due to persistent STE and poor contractility.
* She is being treated with dopamine for cardiac support and will be weaned as tolerated.
* Heparin will be continued for ventricular thrombus prophylaxis.
* Coumadin has been initiated for anticoagulation, and the patient will be followed up in 3 months for repeat echocardiogram and possible discontinuation.
* The patient has a history of anemia and will be monitored for signs of acute blood loss anemia, with transfusion considered if the hemoglobin level falls below 27 g/dL or if symptoms develop.
* She has a risk of anaphylaxis due to the IV contrast used during PCI and will be monitored for signs of anaphylaxis, including throat closing and hypotension.
* The patient's estrogen therapy will be discontinued, and she will continue to take home synthroid for hypothyroidism.
* She has a history of MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) and will be followed up as an outpatient.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventricular thrombus: The patient is at risk for ventricular thrombus formation due to persistent STE and poor contractility.
2. LV aneurysmal formation: The patient is at risk for LV aneurysmal formation due to persistent STE and poor contractility.
3. Anaphylaxis: The patient is at risk for anaphylaxis due to the IV contrast used during PCI.
4. Hypotension: The patient is at risk for hypotension due to ongoing myocardial infarction and poor contractility.
5. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient is at risk for acute blood loss anemia due to ongoing bleeding and poor hemoglobin levels.
6. Mechanical complications: The patient is at risk for mechanical complications, including ventricular thrombus and LV aneurysmal formation, due to persistent STE and poor contractility.

Recommendations:

1. Continue dopamine for cardiac support and wean as tolerated.
2. Continue heparin for ventricular thrombus prophylaxis.
3. Initiate coumadin for anticoagulation and follow up in 3 months for repeat echocardiogram and possible discontinuation.
4. Monitor for signs of anaphylaxis and provide emergency treatment if necessary.
5. Monitor for signs of acute blood loss anemia and provide transfusion if necessary.
6. Continue to follow up with the patient as an outpatient to monitor for signs of mechanical complications and adjust treatment as necessary."

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure X 1
   day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1 day PTA after
   dinner. Pressure was described as located in the mid chest without
   radiation. She stated that she has been experiencing dyspnea over the
   past two months and was undergoing a pulmonary workup with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   recalls feeling severe nausea.  She went to bed essentially chest pain
   free per her report.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with persistence of her
   symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She describes it as sharp,
   substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.  It was associated with
   nausea.  She denied associated SOB or diphoresis, radiation.  She also
   denied recent illness, jaw pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or
   hematemesis. She called EMS and was brought to the ED then to the
   floor. On the floor the patient experienced worse chest pain associated
   with ST elevations in V3-V6 so she was brought to the cath lab. Cath
   demonstrated an occluded LAD at the mid level with moderate disease
   elsewhere. A 2.5mm X 12mm MiniVision (BMS) stent was placed in the mid
   LAD and post-dilated with a 2.5mm NC balloon with TIMI 3 flow following
   the procedure. Echo demonstrated severe HK to akinesis in the anterior
   wall with EF 30-35%. CK perk was 976 with MB 9.5 and trop 6.13.
   Integrilin is now off. BPs have been 80/60 and so ACEI has been held.
   Otherwise no further chest pain this am but she does report
   intermittent throat tightness similar to her allergic symptoms but the
   symptoms are not present now.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - bibas rales
   heart - soft HSM
   ext - no edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Mrs [**Known lastname 3335**] is doing better today with ongoing hypotension overnight
   requiring moderate doses of dopamine to keep BPs in the 90-100 range.
   She reports no further chest pain. DA is at 3.5 mcg/min. She has a low
   grade temp with a rising wbc count to 10.1. Renal function is stable.
   Her hypotension is likely from stunning as she is only on low dose
   metoprolol. CK peaked in the 970 range. We will continue plavix and asa
   for one year as well as coumadin for prophylaxis against mural
   thrombus. We will give her H2B for GI coverage while she is taking
   three anticoagulants. To floor once DA weaned off.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yof w/ h/o dyslipidemia p/w SSCP and nausea, STE on ECG, and
   complete occlusion of mid LAD, s/p bare metal stent placement.
   # CORONARIES - Pt s/p  bare metal stent.   She was loaded with
   integrellin and heparin.  She was also started on low dose captopril
   for cardioprotection.  BB was deferred given risk of vasovagal response
   and bradycardia with sheath removal.  She has remained hypotensive
   while asleep, normotensive when awake.  Given low nighttime blood
   pressures evening dose of captopril was held.  Continues to have HR in
   80s-90s.  BB for HR control may have better outcomes.  Does not require
   afterload reduction at present
   - atorvastatin 80
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75
   - will hold BB until BP improves.
   - will consider ACE when BP improves
   # PUMP:  Pt now s/p STEMI with worsening STE on ECG s/p intervention.
   Perisistent STE after revascularization is not an uncommon phenomenon,
   present in 20-50% of pts in numerous trials assessing this marker of
   poor prognosis,  increasing risk of LV aneurysmal formation, possibly
   other mechanical complications.  She also recieved IV steroids w/in 24
   hrs of STEMI, some data suggests this may possibly increase risk of
   mechanical complication.   Post infarct ECHO shows 35% and pt has
   persistent hypotension, responding minimally to fluids.  Poor
   contractility is likely the cause of hypotension.  Doing well on
   Dopamine.
   - continue Dopa, wean as tolerated
   - follow UOP and O2 sats
   - contin heparin for ventricular thrombus
   - initiated coumadin 5mg  [**11-30**], can f/u in 3 months for repeat ECHO,
   and possible d/c at that time.
   # RHYTHM: Pt has maintained nl sinus rhythm throughout, intermittent
   PVCs
   #Anemia
 Hct 32.  Baseline 40.  Negative 1L post cath (after being
   given IVF for renal protection prior to cath).
   -          Acute blood loss anemia, though significant blood loss not
   reported with procedure
   -          dilutional, pt received IVF prior to admission to the CCU
   -          will trend, Transfuse if Hct <27 or sx.
   -
   # Contrast allergy - Pt has risk of anaphylaxis with IV contrast she
   was given for PCI.  She was pretreated with solumedrol and benadryl.
   Will have to follow for signs of anaphylaxis, including throat closing,
   hypotension.  No severe sx.  Hypotension can be attributed to this
   also, but she has been premedicated, and has no respiratory sx.
   - Loratadine prn
   # ?Hypoestrogenism - Pt on long term estrogen therapy since the late
   [**2037**].  Not needed.
   - d/c estrogen
   # Hypothyroidism - continue home synthroid
   #MGUS - stable, followed as outpt
   #L2 - L3 Laminectomy s/p growth stim, leads unable to be removed, pt
   unable to get MRI.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure one day prior to admission. She underwent PCI with stenting of the mid LAD and post-dilation with a balloon. She has persistent ST elevations on ECG and is experiencing hypotension, requiring dopamine to maintain a blood pressure of 90-100 mmHg. Her physical examination is notable for bibasilar rales, soft holosystolic murmur, and no evidence of edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Persistent ST elevations on ECG may indicate ongoing myocardial damage or stunned myocardium.
	* Hypotension may be related to stunned myocardium or poor contractility.
	* Risk of LV aneurysmal formation or mechanical complications due to persistent ST elevations.
2. Hemodynamic Instability:
	* Hypotension may be exacerbated by continued dopamine therapy, and weaning off dopamine may be necessary.
	* Risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias due to hypotension.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension, hypovolemia, or nephrotoxic medications.
	* Risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to prolonged exposure to nephrotoxic medications.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and NSAID use.
	* Risk of nausea and vomiting due to hypotension, medications, or cardiac conditions.
5. Respiratory Complications:
	* Risk of respiratory failure due to bibasilar rales, hypotension, or cardiac conditions.
6. Thrombotic Complications:
	* Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to anticoagulation therapy and immobilization.
	* Risk of mural thrombus formation due to cardiac conditions and anticoagulation therapy.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue dopamine therapy to maintain blood pressure, but wean off as tolerated.
2. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as persistent ST elevations, hypotension, or arrhythmias.
3. Monitor for signs of hemodynamic instability, such as hypotension, tachycardia, or decreased cardiac output.
4. Monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
5. Monitor gastrointestinal function and adjust medications accordingly.
6. Monitor respiratory function and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor for signs of thrombotic complications, such as DVT or PE, and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
8. Consider transferring the patient to the floor once dopamine is weaned off and hemodynamic stability is achieved."
