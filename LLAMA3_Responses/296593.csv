   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, no resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1). Likely source is pulmonary given clinical symptoms
   and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate .  Other sources include
   abdomen given h/o C. diff, but without localizing abd symptoms. UA neg.
   No other clear source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-).
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (will consider dc levo if no worsening of
   sepsis and QTc continues to rise, currently 459, given (-) legionella).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage until stool c. diff (-)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  . CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload on exam or
   CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.4. Pt is
   on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - re-start dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 71 M sev copd (2L O2, chronic steroids) d
   chf, a- flutter s/p ablation/PCM, recent admit [**Date range (1) 7495**] for copd exac,
   recent c-diff infection s/p course flagyl p/w sepsis and acute on
   chronic hypercarbic resp failure. Remained on intermittent NiPPV.
   Hypotension resolved after IVF bolus.

     * Severe AS
   Immunosuppressed host on chronic steroids.  Possible etiologies for
   septic presentation include resp process (neg CXR), c diff, unlikely
   UTI (neg u/a).? viral process given diarrhea and resp sxs. Cx data is
   unrevealing to date. Agree with plan to continue broad empiric antibx
   coverage (vanco, cef, flagyl, levo), tapering per cx data over the next
   1-2 days. It is reasonable to continue levo for atypical coverage,
   monitoring ecg and Qtc. NSTEMI/troponin elevation is likely related to
   demand ischemia in pt with severe AS in setting of tachycardia and
   hypot. His CEs have peaked at 0.2 and are now trending down. Will
   obtain TTE to reassess cardiac fx, continue asa, start statin and
   notify pts cardiologist  His air movement remains poor and he is
   wheezy
would continue current dose of steroids and NEBS for COPD
   flare. Continue using intermittent NiPPV, monitoring abgs/signs of
   fatigue. His hypotension and tachycardia have resolved with IVFs and he
   is now af with improving leukocytosis. Would resume low dose rate
   control regimen (on CCB at home).  Keep NPO given tenuous resp status.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Patient is critically ill

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, no resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1). Likely source is pulmonary given clinical symptoms
   and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate .  Other sources include
   abdomen given h/o C. diff, but without localizing abd symptoms. UA neg.
   No other clear source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-).
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (will consider dc levo if no worsening of
   sepsis and QTc continues to rise, currently 459, given (-) legionella).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage until stool c. diff (-)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  . CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload on exam or
   CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.4. Pt is
   on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - re-start dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.

   monitoring ecg and Qtc. NSTEMI/troponin elevation is likely related to
   demand ischemia in pt with severe AS in setting of tachycardia and

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, a-fib, diastolic CHF, and AS who presented with sepsis and respiratory distress. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, and has been intubated on BiPAP. His condition has been complicated by cardiac ischemia, hypercapnic respiratory failure, and diastolic CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to be related to a pulmonary source, given his clinical symptoms and respiratory distress. However, other sources, including the abdomen and urinary tract, have not been ruled out.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels have been trending up, and his CKMB levels have been elevated. This suggests that he has had a recent myocardial infarction, likely due to demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
3. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation is likely to be exacerbated by his sepsis, and he may require continued treatment with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic CHF is likely to be related to his AS, and his BNP levels have been elevated. He may require further treatment with diuretics and vasodilators.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's a-fib is likely to be related to his sepsis and tachycardia, and he may require further treatment with antiarrhythmic medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis, including vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
2. Continue treatment for cardiac ischemia, including aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins.
3. Continue treatment for hypercapnic respiratory failure, including bronchodilators, oxygen therapy, and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
4. Continue treatment for diastolic CHF, including diuretics, vasodilators, and ACE inhibitors.
5. Continue treatment for a-fib, including antiarrhythmic medications and cardioversion.
6. Monitor the patient's condition closely for signs of deterioration, including changes in his respiratory status, cardiac rhythm, and blood pressure.
7. Consider further testing, including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function and coronary artery disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, and AS (valve area 1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, cardiac ischemia, hypercapneic respiratory failure, and diastolic CHF. The patient's condition has been unstable, with tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin, and has received IV fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 and urine output (UOP) greater than 30cc/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of progression to severe sepsis or septic shock.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's cardiac ischemia is likely to continue, and there is a risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac arrest.
3. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercapneic respiratory failure is likely to continue, and there is a risk of respiratory arrest or ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic CHF is likely to continue, and there is a risk of worsening heart failure or cardiac arrest.
5. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of worsening symptoms or cardiac arrest.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing a new infection, particularly given his immunocompromised state and the presence of a central line.
7. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding, particularly given his coagulopathy and the presence of a central line.
8. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of developing a thrombus, particularly given his history of atrial fibrillation and the presence of a central line.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure, particularly given his severe COPD and the presence of a ventilator.
10. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk of cardiac arrest, particularly given his cardiac ischemia, diastolic CHF, and aortic stenosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Had an elevated lactate, no resolved (high 4.0, now 1.1)
   and was transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the ICU,
   responsive to 600mL IVF. Likely source is pulmonary given clinical
   symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate .  Other
   sources include abdomen given h/o C. diff, but without localizing abd
   symptoms. UA neg. No other clear source of infection.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12, MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (legionella coverage).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage until stool c. diff (-)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u legionella antigen
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  . CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - repeat TTE today
   - consult cards for possible cath after sepsis/infection has resolved
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   .
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload on exam or
   CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.4. Pt is
   on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - hold diltazem given pt's sepsis
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - repeat TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - repeat TTE

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, and AS (valve area 1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm (96-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/56 mmHg (73-137/69-95 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (17-30 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 89%

The patient is receiving respiratory support with BiPAP mask, and his ABG results are:

* pH: 7.42
* PaCO2: 47 mmHg
* PaO2: 293 mmHg
* FiO2: 30%
* SpO2: 89%

The patient has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and his plan includes:

* IV fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12, MAP > 65, and UOP > 30cc/hr
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past), Cefepime (pseudomonal coverage given COPD and frequent hospitalizations), and levo (legionella coverage)
* Continuation of Flagyl for C. diff coverage until stool C. diff (-)
* Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures
* Trend WBC count fever curve

The patient also has a diagnosis of cardiac ischemia, with troponin-T trending up since admission, and is being treated with aspirin 325mg, repeat TTE today, and consult cardiology for possible catheterization after sepsis/infection has resolved.

The patient's hypercapnic respiratory failure is being managed with BiPAP, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, methylpred 60mg q6, and treatment with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo.

The patient's diastolic CHF is being monitored, and his home lasix is being held for now.

The patient's history of atrial fibrillation is being managed with Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H, and his coumadin is being held for now.

The patient's aortic stenosis is being monitored, and his valve area is 1.0 cm on cath.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation
* Cardiac ischemia or infarction due to sepsis and tachycardia
* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g. acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction)
* Pulmonary embolism due to immobility and sepsis
* C. difficile colitis due to antibiotic use
* Legionella pneumonia due to respiratory viral screen and flu DFA
* Hyperkalemia due to potassium supplements and medications

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Had an elevated lactate, no resolved (high 4.0, now 1.1)
   and was transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the ICU,
   responsive to 600mL IVF. Likely source is pulmonary given clinical
   symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate .  Other
   sources include abdomen given h/o C. diff, but without localizing abd
   symptoms. UA neg. No other clear source of infection.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain CVP 8-12, MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (legionella coverage).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage until stool c. diff (-)
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u legionella antigen
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  . CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - repeat TTE today
   - consult cards for possible cath after sepsis/infection has resolved
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   .
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload on exam or
   CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.4. Pt is
   on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - hold diltazem given pt's sepsis
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - repeat TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - repeat TTE

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   .
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h

   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - repeat ABG later today for lactate

   recent c-diff infection s/p course flagyl p/w sepsis, acute on chronic

   with plan to taper antibx given neg cx results and clear cxr.  Would
   change to PO vanco for c. diff recurrence.  Will d/c vanco/cefepime,
   and change levo to doxy for COPD/bronchitis, given antiarrythmics.
   Needs repeat ecg to follow QTc.  NSTEMI/troponin elevation likely
   related to demand ischemia in pt with severe AS in setting of
   tachycardia and hypot. His CEs peaked at 0.2 and are now down. His TTE
   was essentially unchanged from prior. We continue asa and statin and
   home regimen of lasix and dilt.  We continue to hold his coumadin given
   supra-therapeutic INR. His air movement is improving but he remains
   wheezy--would start slow steroid taper, continuing NEBS for COPD
   flare. Would continue NiPPV intermittently.  He apparently has BiPAP at
   home, but does not use.  Would benefit from this as outpt given his
   chronic CO2 retention. Will monitor his lactate.  Remainder of plan as
   outlined in resident note.
   Patient is critically ill, continue to monitor resp status closely in
   ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   supra-therapeutic INR. His air movement is improving but he remains
   wheezy--would start slow steroid taper, continuing NEBS for COPD
   flare. Would continue NiPPV intermittently.  He apparently has BiPAP at
   home, but does not use.  Would benefit from this as outpt given his
   chronic CO2 retention. Will monitor his lactate.  Remainder of plan as
   outlined in resident note.
   Patient is critically ill, continue to monitor resp status closely in

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, and aortic stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, acute respiratory distress, and hypercapneic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC, with improved oxygenation on BiPAP. He has mild labored breathing, tachypnea, and decreased BS bilaterally.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has aortic stenosis with a valve area of 1.0 cm, and is pre-load dependent. His cardiac enzymes are stable, with a peak CK of 94 and a peak Trop-T of 0.16.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 99/65 mmHg, and his heart rate is 70 bpm.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 16.1, and his Hct is 31.9. His lactate level is 2.3, and his BUN is 27.
* Imaging studies: The patient's CXR is clear, with no infiltrate or effusion.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and bronchodilators.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and he has a history of C. diff infection. He may be at risk for further septic episodes.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he may still require close monitoring and intervention.
* Cardiac ischemia: The patient's cardiac enzymes are stable, but he may still be at risk for further cardiac ischemia.
* Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis may worsen over time, leading to cardiac complications.
* C. diff recurrence: The patient has a history of C. diff infection, and may be at risk for further recurrence.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan of care should include:

* Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and cardiovascular function.
* Administration of antibiotics and anticoagulants as indicated.
* Management of the patient's aortic stenosis, including replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload.
* Monitoring of the patient's lactate level and BUN.
* Consideration of further imaging studies, such as a TTE, to assess the patient's cardiac function.
* Close monitoring of the patient's C. diff status and potential recurrence."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   .
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - re-start dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, and AS (valve area 1.0 cm). He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory distress. The patient has developed cardiac ischemia, with increasing troponin levels and a recent TTE showing severe AS (0.8-1.0). He is also experiencing worsening COPD exacerbation, with increasing WOB and SOB.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are increasing, indicating ongoing cardiac ischemia. This could lead to further cardiac damage and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Sepsis: The patient's lactate levels are increasing, indicating ongoing sepsis. This could lead to multi-organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation is worsening, putting him at risk for respiratory failure. This could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac Failure: The patient's diastolic CHF is a concern, especially given his pre-load dependent status. This could lead to worsening cardiac function and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
5. Bleeding Risk: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, which increases his risk of bleeding. This could be exacerbated by the need for invasive procedures or the use of anticoagulant medications.
6. Infection: The patient's C. diff positive status and recent antibiotics could lead to antibiotic-resistant infections, which could be life-threatening.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and his current use of anticoagulant medications increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac ischemia and troponin levels closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids, and monitor his lactate levels closely.
3. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory care, including the use of BiPAP and nebulizers.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely, and consider adjusting his diuretic therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Consider the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulation therapy and medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   .
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - repeat ABG later today for lactate
   .
   # Hematuria
 while examining pt with team today, red urine noted in
   foley bag. Uncertain etiology given Cr and HCT stable. Most likely
   traumatic foley
   - f/u UA
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - restart home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE

   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, a-fib, diastolic CHF, and AS. He presented with sepsis, respiratory distress, and myocardial infarction. He has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, steroids, and oxygen therapy. His current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure with hypercapnia and hypoxemia
* Sepsis with elevated lactate and WBC count
* Myocardial infarction with elevated troponin and CK-MB levels
* Hematuria with uncertain etiology
* Diastolic CHF with normal ejection fraction
* Atrial fibrillation with a history of AV junction ablation and dual chamber pacemaker placement

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, to manage his respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not managed promptly, and he may require further antibiotics and fluids to manage his condition.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's myocardial infarction is likely to progress if not managed promptly, and he may require further interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy or cardiac catheterization.
4. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria is uncertain in origin, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause of his bleeding.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic CHF may worsen if not managed promptly, and he may require further interventions, such as diuretics or vasodilators, to manage his condition.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not managed promptly, and he may require further interventions, such as cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy, to manage his condition.

Interventions:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Administer antibiotics and fluids to manage sepsis.
3. Manage the patient's myocardial infarction with thrombolytic therapy or cardiac catheterization.
4. Evaluate and manage the patient's hematuria with further diagnostic testing and interventions as necessary.
5. Manage the patient's diastolic CHF with diuretics or vasodilators as necessary.
6. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy as necessary."

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   .
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - cont broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco (MRSA + in past),
   Cefepime (pseudommonal coverage given COPD and frequent
   hospitalizations) and levo (will consider dc levo if no worsening of
   sepsis and QTc continues to rise, currently 459, given (-) legionella).
   - will cont flagyl for c. diff coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   -  f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Being treated w/ Cefep/Vanco/levo/flagyl.  Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload
   on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - cont methylpred 60mg q6
   - treat with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - hold home lasix for now
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - re-start dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, a-fib, diastolic CHF, and AS. He presents with sepsis, respiratory distress, and cardiac ischemia.

The patient's condition has been worsening over the past 24 hours, with increasing lactate levels, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. His respiratory status has also deteriorated, with increasing work of breathing and oxygen requirements. His cardiac enzymes have been trending up, suggesting ongoing myocardial ischemia.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin, as well as antifungal therapy for suspected C. diff. He has also been started on aspirin and statins for cardiac ischemia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis. His lactate levels have increased, suggesting ongoing sepsis.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels have been trending up, suggesting ongoing myocardial ischemia. The most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
3. Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD has exacerbated, leading to increased work of breathing and oxygen requirements.
4. Diastolic CHF: The patient's BNP levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac ischemia and sepsis increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercapnic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
3. Sepsis-Related Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular failure.
4. C. diff-Associated Diarrhea: The patient's C. diff infection may lead to diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's tachycardia and hypoxia increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.
3. Antifungal therapy for suspected C. diff.
4. Aspirin and statins for cardiac ischemia.
5. Continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac status.
6. Repeat ABG and CXR to monitor respiratory status.
7. Close monitoring of volume status and diuretic therapy.
8. Hold home lasix for now.
9. Re-start Dilt at home dose.
10. Cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 70-inch tall, 82.3 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of worsening COPD and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced hematuria in their Foley catheter, which was attributed to a traumatic catheter placement. The catheter was replaced, and a urinalysis (U/A) was sent. The patient also had low urine output (UOP) and was found to have clots in the Foley catheter, which were cleared.

The patient's EKG showed a prolonged QT interval in the morning, which resolved to normal by the afternoon. Dofetilide was discontinued due to this finding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 76 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 inspirations per minute (insp/min). Oxygen saturation is 100%, and the patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 14.0-16.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.8-12.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 165-217 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.11-0.16 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28-32 mg/dL
* Glucose: 121-169 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results, including electrolyte levels, liver enzymes, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient's diagnosis is acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute exacerbation. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's AMI and prolonged QT interval
* Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the patient's COPD and acute exacerbation
* Sepsis, including septic shock, due to the patient's increased risk of infection from the urinary catheter and other invasive lines
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, including upper gastrointestinal bleeding, due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and potential bleeding complications from the urinary catheter
* Renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI), due to the patient's decreased urine output and potential nephrotoxicity from medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall male with a weight of 82.3 kg (admission) 79.5 kg, who is currently on non-invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 76 bpm (70-83 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 120/70 mmHg (80-138/121 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 inspirations per minute (20-33 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Ventricular paced

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Mild labored breathing
* Tachypnea
* Poor inspiratory effort
* Decreased breath sounds bilaterally
* Scattered wheezes throughout
* No rales or rhonchi
* Tachycardia
* Regular rhythm
* Normal S1 and S2
* No rubs or gallops
* Ventral hernia, reducible, soft, non-tender, non-distended
* Bowel sounds hypoactive
* No rebound tenderness or guarding

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.0-16.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.8-12.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 165-217 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.11-0.15 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27-32 mmHg
* Glucose: 121-169 mg/dL
* Other labs: see below

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonged QT interval
* Sepsis or septic shock due to potential bacterial infections
* Bleeding or thrombotic complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Renal failure due to hypovolemia or nephrotoxicity
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and DVT prophylaxis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent or address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with
   increased WOB and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to
   baseline 2L NC (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation
   in the setting of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given
   tachycardia, although pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-).
   Receiving nebs and methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No
   evidence of overload on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg q6h
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased today so will avoid meds
   accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff
   - d/c IV Vanco/ cefepime/levo
 change to doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for
   atypical coverage
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u respiraotory viral screen and flu DFA
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - repeat ABG later today for lactate
   .
   # Hematuria
 while examining pt with team today, red urine noted in
   foley bag. Uncertain etiology given Cr and HCT stable. Most likely
   traumatic foley
   - f/u UA
   .
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  Pt
s trops have been trending up since admission
   0.05, 0.2,  CKMB 10 and.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to
   demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - TTE today
   - f/u last trop, CKMB
   - currently on statins for sepsis study but given NSTEMI will remove
   from study and start a statin
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - restart home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin and INR 3.6 today.
   Pt is on Dofetilide and Dilt.
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - cont Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - hold coumadin for now
   - TTE
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 71-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis. The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He has required frequent infusions of oxygen and has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results have shown a significant increase in white blood cell count (WBC), indicating a possible infection. The urinalysis (U/A) showed gross blood, but no nitrite or leukocytes, suggesting a possible traumatic catheter or bleeding from the kidneys. The patient's cardiac enzymes, such as troponin-T, have been elevated, indicating possible cardiac ischemia.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis, and a history of severe COPD. He is currently on medications for these conditions, including warfarin, aspirin, and statins.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Hypercapnic respiratory failure: The patient is being treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and bronchodilators to manage his respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV fluids to manage his sepsis.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient is being treated with aspirin and statins to manage his cardiac ischemia.
4. Diastolic heart failure: The patient is being monitored for volume status and will be restarted on his home diuretic, lasix.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's warfarin therapy has been held, and he is being monitored for cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Aortic stenosis: The patient's valve area is 1.0 cm, and he is being monitored for any signs of cardiac compromise.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and cardiac ischemia makes him susceptible to developing cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is ongoing, and he is at risk for developing further complications, such as organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's traumatic catheter and elevated blood pressure make him at risk for bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for developing respiratory failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Acute COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with hypercapneic
   Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with increased WOB
   and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to baseline 2L NC
   (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation in the setting
   of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given tachycardia, although
   pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-). Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload
   on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - Given doxycycline (treatment started on [**7-18**]). Will treat for 7 days
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will switch to PO tomorrow.
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased so will avoid meds accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco (started [**6-22**]) for C diff  for a [**10-3**] day
   course
   - Follow-up blood culture
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin at home. Pt
   currently on dilt. Dofetilide held due to increased QT interval (due to
   concominant use of Levaquin).
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - Since QT normal, start Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - INR therapeutic, so will start home dose of Coumadin 5 mg today
   - Patient needs a TTE
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  patient had a troponin leak in the context of
   respiratory distress.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to demand
   ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - Started on lipitor
   - Consider a beta blocker, however, patient has COPD so worry about
   side effects
   - needs TTE
   # Hematuria
 Patient had hematuria. Found to have clots in his
   bladder. Started CBI and urology said can D/C it. Hematuria resolved in
   AM. U/A negative for infection
   - Need to f/u with urology.
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - On home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, atrial fibrillation, diastolic CHF, and aortic stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory distress, and cardiac ischemia.

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Acute COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure, and was placed on BiPAP but transitioned to 2L NC due to increased WOB and SOB. The patient is at risk for respiratory failure and hypoxia.
2. Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis. The likely source of sepsis is pulmonary, given clinical symptoms and respiratory distress. The patient is at risk for multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient had a troponin leak in the context of respiratory distress, and most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to demand ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia. The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.
4. Hematuria: The patient had hematuria and was found to have clots in his bladder. The patient is at risk for recurrent hematuria and urinary tract infections.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and is at risk for acute exacerbation.
6. Aortic stenosis: The patient has aortic stenosis and is pre-load dependent. The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 14.0-16.4 K/uL
* Hct: 31.3-34.0%
* Plt: 165-217 K/uL
* Cr: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.11-0.15 ng/mL
* Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's medication list includes:

* Dofetilide (held due to increased QT interval)
* Dilt (home dose)
* Coumadin (started at home dose)
* Aspirin (325mg)
* Lipitor
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Atovaquone (1500mg for PCP)
* Vancomycin (for C diff)
* Metronidazole (for C diff)
* Cefipime (for sepsis)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (for sepsis)
* Levofloxacin (for sepsis)
* Methylprednisolone (for COPD exacerbation)
* Albuterol and ipratropium nebs (for COPD exacerbation)
* Doxycycline (for sepsis)

The patient's plan includes:

* Acute COPD exacerbation: Continue intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC, follow-up with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status.
* Sepsis: Continue IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, change flagyl to PO Vanco for C diff, and follow-up with blood culture.
* Cardiac ischemia: Start ASA 325mg and Lipitor, consider beta blocker, and needs TTE.
* Hematuria: Follow-up with urology and monitor for recurrent hematuria and urinary tract infections.
* Diastolic CHF: Monitor volume status and continue home lasix 30 po daily.
* Aortic stenosis: Replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload and monitor closely.

The patient will be transferred to the floors today."

   MICU Attending  Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the above note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7523**]
   and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 2964**] has very
   severe COPD which he feels is nearly back to baseline, though he
   remains of high dose steroids, Nebs, O2, and antibiotics for his COPD
   flare. He was able to go without using BIPAP last night. Steroids are
   being tapered slowly.
    His CDiff is being Rx
d with po Vanco, and he is showing no signs of
   the sepsis that brought him into MICU. Prlonged QT has been corrected
   by stopping dofetilide and levaquin. Dofetilide will be reintroduced.
   If he continues to look and feel well throughout the day he may be
   called out to the floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 71 year-old male with a history of severe COPD (FEV1 24%
   predicted) on home 02, a-fib on coumadin, diastolic CHF, AS (valve area
   1.0 cm) who presents with sepsis and respiratory distress.
   .
   Plan:
   #. Acute COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with hypercapneic
   Respiratory Failure: Pt with severe COPD presented with increased WOB
   and SOB. Was placed on BiPAP but quickly transitioned to baseline 2L NC
   (since 11pm last night). Most likely COPD exacerbation in the setting
   of sepsis. Other possibility, althought, PE given tachycardia, although
   pt is already anti-coagulated and D-Dimer (-). Receiving nebs and
   methylpred. ABG oxygenation improved on BiPAP.  No evidence of overload
   on exam or CXR.
   - follow patient with repeat ABG and close monitoring of resp status
   - cont intermittent BIPAP and 2L NC
   - Given doxycycline (treatment started on [**7-18**]). Will treat for 7 days
   - cont albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - taper methylpred 60mg q6 to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will switch to PO tomorrow.
   - adjust abx as below for potential infx etiologies
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u cx
   - pulmonary toliet
   - cont Atovaquone 1500mg for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1694**]
   .
   # Sepsis - Patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever (103), and
   leukocytosis.  Transiently hypotensive (80s/50s) on admission to the
   ICU, responsive to 600mL IVF and had an elevated lactate, resolved
   (high 4.0, now 1.1), then returned to 2.3. Likely source is pulmonary
   given clinical symptoms and resp distress. CXR clear and no infiltrate
   .  C. diff positive today (has h/o C. diff). UA neg. No other clear
   source of infection.  Legionella antigen (-). Lactate inc to 2.3 today,
   and WBC up to 16, likely due to C diff, may be resistant. Given no
   pulmonary sources yet and improving CXR, can change to atypical
   coverage. Also, QTc slightly increased so will avoid meds accordingly.
   - IV fluid boluses to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - change flagyl to PO Vanco (started [**6-22**]) for C diff  for a [**10-3**] day
   course
   - Follow-up blood culture
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   #. H/o Atrial fibrillation: s/p AV junction ablation & [**Company **] dual
   chamber pacer placement in [**2153**].  Pt is on coumadin at home. Pt
   currently on dilt. Dofetilide held due to increased QT interval (due to
   concominant use of Levaquin).
   - cont dilt at
 home dose
   - Since QT normal, start Dofetilide 375 mcg Q12H
   - INR therapeutic, so will start home dose of Coumadin 5 mg today
   - Patient needs a TTE
   #Cardiac Ischemia:  patient had a troponin leak in the context of
   respiratory distress.  Most likely explanation is NSTEMI due to demand
   ischemia driven by sepsis and tachycardia.
   - started asa 325mg
   - Started on lipitor
   - Consider a beta blocker, however, patient has COPD so worry about
   side effects
   - needs TTE
   # Hematuria
 Patient had hematuria. Found to have clots in his
   bladder. Started CBI and urology said can D/C it. Hematuria resolved in
   AM. U/A negative for infection
   - Need to f/u with urology.
   .
   #. Diastolic CHF (EF >55%): Pt appears euvolemic on exam.  He is on
   lasix at home. BNP: 380 (prior 398). CXR did not show edema or
   effusions that would inidicate acute exacerbation.
   - Will monitor volume status
   - On home lasix 30 po daily
   .
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis: Pt valve area 1.0 on cath [**4-27**]. Currently stable
   and will monitor closely.  Pt is pre-load dependent.
   - replete fluids as necessary to maintain preload
   - TTE
   .

   MICU Attending  Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the above note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7523**]
   and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 2964**] has very
   severe COPD which he feels is nearly back to baseline, though he
   remains of high dose steroids, Nebs, O2, and antibiotics for his COPD
   flare. He was able to go without using BIPAP last night. Steroids are
   being tapered slowly.
    His CDiff is being Rx
d with po Vanco, and he is showing no signs of
   the sepsis that brought him into MICU. Prlonged QT has been corrected
   by stopping dofetilide and levaquin. Dofetilide will be reintroduced.
   If he continues to look and feel well throughout the day he may be
   called out to the floor.
