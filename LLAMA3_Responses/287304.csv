   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  A sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx
   500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the
   setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs
   levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  Patient received 4g
   Mg.  Interrogation reveals appropriate function.  Unlikely to be
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation (AF) on dofetilide, and a bi-ventricular (BiV) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. She received 4g of magnesium and is being monitored on telemetry.

Current condition:

* The patient has a V-paced rhythm with QTc prolongation to approximately 500.
* She is hypokalemic (K 3.3) and received 20mg of IV lasix for SOB and bibasilar crackles.
* Her BP is 109/57 mmHg, and her SpO2 is 95%.
* She has crackles at bilateral lung bases, R>L, and rhonchi throughout.
* Her abdomen is soft, and there is no tenderness or masses.

Potential medical complications:

* Prolonged QT interval: May lead to torsades de pointes or polymorphic VT.
* Hypokalemia: May exacerbate arrhythmias and increase risk of cardiac arrest.
* Acute diastolic heart failure: May lead to worsening pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
* Volume overload: May exacerbate cardiac failure and increase risk of arrhythmias.
* Potential electrolyte imbalances: May affect cardiac function and increase risk of arrhythmias.

Plan:

* Hold dofetilide for now.
* Consider initiation of amiodarone.
* Reprogram the ICD for faster HR (85).
* Continue beta blockers.
* Hold warfarin today for INR 3.1, and restart tomorrow.
* Replete potassium and magnesium levels.
* Monitor on telemetry.
* Consider spironolactone.
* Follow up with TTE this morning.
* Hold home dose of PO lasix and give IV lasix prn.
* Monitor electrolytes closely."

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  A sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx
   500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the
   setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs
   levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  Patient received 4g
   Mg.  Interrogation reveals appropriate function.  Unlikely to be
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.
   - Hold Dofetilide for now
   - get endocrine c/s re possible initiation of amiodarone
   - EP reprogram the ICD for faster HR (85)
   - Cont BB
   - Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.1, will restart tomorrow
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - consider spironolactone
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  Patient with
   h/o moderate concentric LVH with preserved EF (> 70%).  Wedge pressure
   elevated in prior echo and cath.  Evidence of volume overload on exam
   this AM.  Patient was given 20mg IV lasix this AM ([**12-30**]) for SOB and
   bibasilar crackles.  No EKG changes.  Etiology for patient's acute
   pulmonary edema (no evidence of ischemia, no dietary indiscretion) is
   diastolic heart failure.
   - f/u TTE this AM
   - hold home dose of PO lasix, she received 20mg IV lasix this AM
   - give IV Lasix prn, monitor lytes closely

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and a BiV ICD. She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic VT requiring ICD shock.

The patient's current condition is:

* Heart rhythm: V-paced with QTc prolongation to approximately 500
* Hemodynamics: BP 109/57 mmHg, HR 81 bpm, SpO2 95%
* Lung exam: Crackles at bilateral lung bases, R>L, with rhonchi throughout
* Abdomen: Soft, no tenderness or masses
* Extremities: No edema or bruits
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, with evidence of volume overload on exam. The etiology is likely diastolic heart failure, with no evidence of ischemia or dietary indiscretion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Prolonged QTc interval leading to torsades de pointes or polymorphic VT
* Hypokalemia exacerbating QT prolongation
* Diastolic heart failure leading to worsening pulmonary edema
* Hypertension exacerbating cardiac condition
* Potential for further arrhythmias or cardiac events

The plan includes:

* Holding dofetilide for now and considering initiation of amiodarone
* Repleting potassium and magnesium levels
* Monitoring on telemetry
* F/u TTE to assess cardiac function
* Holding home dose of PO lasix and giving IV Lasix prn
* Monitoring lytes closely
* Continuing metoprolol and considering restarting [**Last Name (un) **] once BP can tolerate it
* Continuing lipitor and tricor

The patient will be transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and management."

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), who presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. She was given 20mg IV lasix for SOB and bibasilar crackles, and her vital signs are stable. The patient's rhythm is currently ventricular-paced, with QTc prolongation to approximately 500. The assessment suggests that the patient's polymorphic VT is likely secondary to medications (doefetilide vs levaquin) or hypokalemia, and that it is unlikely related to ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's HOCM and recent episode of polymorphic VT increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and pulmonary edema may lead to respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other electrolyte-related complications.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's hypertension and potential kidney injury from IV lasix may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay may increase her risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and electrolyte levels closely.
2. Replete potassium and magnesium levels to normal range.
3. Hold doefetilide and continue warfarin as directed.
4. Continue IV lasix as needed, and monitor for signs of fluid overload.
5. Consider f/u TTE to assess cardiac function and volume status.
6. Monitor for signs of infection and take precautions to prevent VAP and other infections.
7. Continue cardiac diet and glycemic control measures as directed."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation, and a BiV ICD. She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.6°C, HR 81 bpm, BP 109/57 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%
* Physical examination: General: NAD, oriented x3, HEENT: NCAT, CARDIAC: RR, normal S1, S2, II/VI systolic flow murmur at RUSB, LUNGS: Crackles at bilateral lung bases (1/3 up), R>L, rhonchi throughout, ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND, EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e, SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* Lab results: WBC 180, Hb 15.8, Hct 45.8, Plt 8.2

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Hypokalemia: The patient received 4g of magnesium, and potassium levels should be closely monitored.
2. QTc prolongation: The patient's QTc interval is approximately 500, which may increase the risk of torsades de pointes.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has evidence of volume overload on exam, and the etiology is unclear. It may be related to her HOCM or other factors.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of polymorphic VT and is currently being monitored on telemetry.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia: Given the patient's history of polymorphic VT and QTc prolongation, there is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and crackles in the lungs may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's BP is 109/57 mmHg, which may worsen if not closely monitored and managed.
4. Worsening cardiac function: The patient's HOCM and pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac function and increased risk of cardiac arrest.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Holding dofetilide for now and restarting it tomorrow if no further episodes of VT occur.
2. Continuing warfarin and monitoring for bleeding.
3. Repleting potassium and magnesium levels.
4. Monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and electrolyte levels.
5. F/U TTE this morning to assess cardiac function.
6. Holding home dose of PO lasix and giving IV lasix prn.
7. Monitoring lytes closely and adjusting medication as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation, and a bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. She was given 4g of magnesium and has been placed on telemetry monitoring. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 109/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination reveals bilateral lung crackles, a normal cardiac examination, and no evidence of ischemia. 

The patient's laboratory results show a prolonged QTc interval, and her electrocardiogram (EKG) reveals an A-V paced rhythm. Her echocardiogram shows clean coronaries and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) > 70%. 

The patient's medications include dofetilide, warfarin, metoprolol, lipitor, and tricor. She has been instructed to hold dofetilide, continue warfarin, and replete potassium and magnesium levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure and volume overload may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, including polymorphic VT, and potential cardiac arrest.
3. QTc Prolongation: The patient's QTc prolongation may increase the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.
4. Ischemia: Although the patient has clean coronaries, the risk of ischemia cannot be ruled out, particularly if the patient's hypokalemia worsens or if there is a delay in reperfusion therapy.
5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of polymorphic VT and ICD shock increases her risk of cardiac arrest, particularly if her hypokalemia worsens or if there is a delay in reperfusion therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation, and a BiV ICD. She presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic VT, which required ICD shock. She was given 4g of magnesium and has been stabilized. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 81bpm, blood pressure of 109/57mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination reveals bilateral lung crackles, and she has been given 20mg of IV lasix for pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypokalemia: The patient's QTc prolongation and polymorphic VT may be related to hypokalemia. It is essential to monitor her potassium levels closely and replete them as necessary.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may be related to her HOCM or volume overload. It is crucial to monitor her fluid balance and adjust her diuretic therapy accordingly.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 100/50mmHg, which is concerning. It is essential to continue her antihypertensive medication and monitor her blood pressure closely.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and polymorphic VT increases her risk of cardiac arrhythmias. It is essential to monitor her cardiac rhythm closely and adjust her medication therapy as necessary.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's bilateral lung crackles and pulmonary edema increase her risk of respiratory failure. It is essential to monitor her oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely and provide respiratory support as necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium levels closely and replete them as necessary.
2. Adjust the patient's diuretic therapy to manage her pulmonary edema.
3. Continue the patient's antihypertensive medication and monitor her blood pressure closely.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm closely and adjust her medication therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely and provide respiratory support as necessary.
6. Consider obtaining a TTE to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function and volume status."

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - get pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with
   acute renal failure.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix for now.
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT requiring ICD shock.
* The patient is currently in the ICU with acute renal failure, hypotension, and respiratory symptoms.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/49 mmHg.
* The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.
* The patient has a sense V-paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approximately 500.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.2 mg/dL, and the patient is at risk of further renal deterioration.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s-80s, which may be related to the patient's underlying cardiac condition and medications.
* Respiratory Symptoms: The patient has rhonchi throughout and mild crackles at the right base, which may indicate pulmonary edema or infection.
* QT Prolongation: The patient's QTc prolongation to approximately 500 may increase the risk of polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes.
* Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of polymorphic VT and may be at risk of further arrhythmias due to her underlying cardiac condition and medications.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections, given her underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospital stay.
* Gastrointestinal Symptoms: The patient has experienced stomach cramping and may be at risk of further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Hold lasix, spironolactone, and valsartan due to acute renal failure.
* Decrease beta blocker to metoprolol 25mg.
* Encourage PO intake and monitor respiratory symptoms.
* Consider gentle IVF if the patient continues to be hypotensive and respiratory symptoms persist.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
* Continue to trend the patient's renal function and adjust medications accordingly.

**Further Evaluation:**

* Electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, particularly potassium and magnesium, to prevent further QT prolongation.
* The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and oxygen therapy should be adjusted as necessary.
* The patient's cardiac rhythm should be monitored closely, and anti-arrhythmic medications should be adjusted as necessary.
* The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and dialysis should be considered if the patient's creatinine level continues to rise."

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - get pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with
   acute renal failure.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix for now.
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - consider gental IVF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has developed ARF, which is a life-threatening condition. The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and they are at risk of further decline in kidney function.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and has experienced episodes of polymorphic VT. The patient's QTc prolongation and hypokalemia may increase the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient has mild crackles in the right base of the lungs, which may indicate early signs of pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypokalemia (K 3.3) and hypomagnesemia (Mg 2.5), which may exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s-80s, which may indicate inadequate perfusion of vital organs. The patient's hypotension should be closely monitored and treated promptly.
6. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which should be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has stomach cramping and is on a bowel regimen, which may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or diarrhea.
8. Fluid Overload: The patient has received 2 doses of IV lasix, which may have contributed to fluid overload. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored to prevent further complications.

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing these complications, including:

1. Continuing to hold lasix, spironolactone, and valsartan due to acute renal failure.
2. Restarting dronedarone tomorrow and holding warfarin due to INR 3.4.
3. Repleting potassium and magnesium levels.
4. Monitoring the patient's cardiac rhythm and treating any arrhythmias promptly.
5. Closely monitoring the patient's respiratory status and treating any signs of pulmonary edema.
6. Managing the patient's electrolyte imbalance and hypotension.
7. Treating the patient's UTI promptly.
8. Monitoring the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjusting the bowel regimen as needed.
9. Continuously reassessing the patient's fluid status and adjusting treatment accordingly."

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - get pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with
   acute renal failure.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - get pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with
   acute renal failure.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix for now.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation, and bi-ventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 83/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination reveals rhonchi throughout and mild crackles at the right base.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 14.9 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 45.8%
* Platelet count: 180 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mEq/L
* Sodium: 138 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.3 mEq/L
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.02 ng/mL

The patient's cardiac enzymes and imaging studies show:

* TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram): moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular systolic function, and increased left ventricular filling pressure.
* Resting LVOT (left ventricular outflow tract) gradient is no longer detected.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Holding lasix, spironolactone, and valsartan due to acute renal failure
* Decreasing beta-blocker to metoprolol 25mg
* Encouraging PO intake
* Monitoring respiratory symptoms
* Considering gentle IVF if hypotension persists and lung exam shows no crackles
* Repleting potassium and magnesium
* Monitoring on telemetry

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Acute renal failure
* Hypotension
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
* Infection (ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection)
* Nutritional deficiencies (malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance)
* Medication side effects (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - consider gental IVF
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - continue to hold dofetilide
   - continue dronedarone, which was restarted on [**12-30**]
   - hold spironolactone in the setting of acute renal failure
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold valsartan given acute renal failure
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT requiring ICD shock.

The patient's current condition is:

* Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80% as seen on TTE on [**12-30**].
* Acute renal failure with Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes showing Feurea of 13.
* Hypotensive in the 70s-80s with acute renal failure.
* QTc prolongation to approx 500 due to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).
* Polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's current Cr level is 2.2, and urine lytes show Feurea of 13, indicating a high risk of worsening renal function.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s-80s, which is below the normal range, and may lead to further complications such as cardiac ischemia or cardiac arrest.
3. Prolonged QT: The patient's QTc prolongation to approx 500 may lead to further episodes of polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes.
4. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80% may lead to further complications such as cardiac ischemia or cardiac arrest.
5. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's current condition may worsen their underlying chronic diastolic heart failure, leading to further complications.

The plan of care should focus on:

1. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting medications accordingly.
2. Managing the patient's blood pressure to prevent further complications.
3. Monitoring the patient's QTc interval and adjusting medications accordingly.
4. Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjusting medications accordingly.
5. Considering gentamicin IVF and avoiding renal toxins and renally dose medications.

The patient's code status is OK for compression, DNI (need to re-address), and their disposition is CCU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF
   - monitor respiratory sx

   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - continue dronedarone, which was restarted on [**12-30**]

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold valsartan given acute renal failure

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. She was started on dofetilide, which was likely contributing to her prolonged QT interval and polymorphic VT. She was also found to have acute renal failure, which was likely caused by the combination of IV lasix, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 95%.
* Cardiac: She has a paced rhythm with a QTc prolongation of approximately 500. Her VT episodes are likely secondary to prolonged QT and hypokalemia.
* Renal: She has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and a urine output of nearly zero.
* Electrolytes: She has hypokalemia (K 3.3) and hypomagnesemia (Mg 2.5).
* Medications: She is currently on dronedarone, which was restarted on [**12-30**]. Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but was held due to acute renal failure. Dofetilide was stopped due to its contribution to her prolonged QT interval.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is already elevated at 2.2 mg/dL, and her urine output is nearly zero. Further worsening of her renal function could lead to more severe complications, such as sepsis or multi-organ failure.
2. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's QTc prolongation is already at approximately 500, which increases her risk of torsades de pointes. Further prolongation of her QT interval could lead to more severe arrhythmias.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium level is already low at 3.3 mEq/L, which increases her risk of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Further hypokalemia could exacerbate her condition.
4. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is already low at 2.5 mEq/L, which increases her risk of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Further hypomagnesemia could exacerbate her condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is already at 95%, which indicates that she may be at risk for respiratory failure. Further deterioration of her respiratory status could lead to more severe complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adjusting her medications to minimize further worsening of her renal failure.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's QT interval and adjust her medications as necessary to minimize further prolongation.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as necessary to minimize further hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting her oxygen therapy as necessary to minimize further deterioration.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist to further evaluate the patient's renal function and develop a plan to manage her acute renal failure."

   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.  Patient was
   hypotensive down to systolic 50s despite holding lasix, spironolactone
   and valsartan on [**12-31**].  Patient was mentating well, but does have end
   organ damage evidenced by actue renal failure.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute

   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 48 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.
   Patient with A sense V paced rhythm, she presented initially with QTc
   prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary
   to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging
   medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K
   3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely related to ischemia as patient has
   clean coronaries on cath 6 months ago, and no history of CAD.
   Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but was held last night due to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix to
   which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg x 1 on
   [**12-30**].  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s
   when sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**], and continued to be held on [**12-31**].  Unfortunately, in the setting
   of relative hypotension and receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg +
   80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were
   low, Cr bumped to 2.2 on [**12-31**], urine lytes showed Feurea of 13. Repeat
   urine lytes on [**12-31**] showedFeNa 0.23.  Patient was given 500cc bolus
   yesterday for creatinine of 2.6 and hypotension to 50s.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure

   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.  Patient was
   hypotensive down to systolic 50s despite holding lasix, spironolactone
   and valsartan on [**12-31**].  Patient was mentating well, but does have end
   organ damage evidenced by actue renal failure.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - continue BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx

   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 48 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.
   Patient with A sense V paced rhythm, she presented initially with QTc
   prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary
   to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging
   medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K
   3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely related to ischemia as patient has
   clean coronaries on cath 6 months ago, and no history of CAD.
   Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but was held last night due to
   acute renal failure.

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.6, and urine output has decreased significantly. Holding antihypertensives and diuretics may have contributed to the worsening of ARF. The patient's hypotension, particularly with systolic pressures in the 50s, may also have exacerbated the condition. Continued monitoring of renal function and potential interventions such as gentle IVF and avoidance of renal toxins are necessary.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure, and the recent administration of IV lasix may have exacerbated the condition. Holding diuretics and antihypertensives may have contributed to the worsening of heart failure. The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output may also be indicative of heart failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure has been in the 50s, which is a concerning sign. The patient's heart rate has been stable, but the patient's blood pressure may be affected by the administration of IV lasix and the holding of antihypertensives. Monitoring of blood pressure and potential interventions such as gentle IVF may be necessary.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium level is 3.3, which is low. The patient's magnesium level is also low, and the patient's phosphate level is normal. The patient's electrolyte imbalance may be contributing to the patient's cardiac arrhythmias and may require repletion.
5. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of polymorphic VT, which may be related to the patient's prolonged QT interval and hypokalemia. The patient's recent administration of QT-prolonging medications may have contributed to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and potential interventions such as flecanide may be necessary.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's decreased urine output and potential heart failure may increase the risk of respiratory complications. Monitoring of respiratory status and potential interventions such as gentle IVF may be necessary.
7. Infection: The patient's temperature is normal, but the patient's recent administration of antibiotics may have contributed to the development of an infection. Monitoring of the patient's temperature and potential interventions such as antibiotics may be necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and potential interventions to address the patient's acute renal failure, heart failure, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory complications, and potential infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix to
   which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg x 1 on
   [**12-30**].  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s
   when sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**], and continued to be held on [**12-31**].  Unfortunately, in the setting
   of relative hypotension and receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg +
   80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were
   low, Cr bumped to 2.2 on [**12-31**], urine lytes showed Feurea of 13. Repeat
   urine lytes on [**12-31**] showedFeNa 0.23.  Patient was given 500cc bolus
   yesterday for creatinine of 2.6 and hypotension to 50s.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - get pm lytes

   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.  Patient was
   hypotensive down to systolic 50s despite holding lasix, spironolactone
   and valsartan on [**12-31**].  Patient was mentating well, but does have end
   organ damage evidenced by actue renal failure.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - continue BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 48 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.
   Patient with A sense V paced rhythm, she presented initially with QTc
   prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary
   to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging
   medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K
   3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely related to ischemia as patient has
   clean coronaries on cath 6 months ago, and no history of CAD.
   Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but was held last night due to
   acute renal failure.
   - restart dronedarone today
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient's Current Status:

* 81-year-old female with HOCM, s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV ICD, and presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT requiring ICD shock.
* Currently hypotensive with BP as low as 50s, and has developed acute renal failure with Cr of 2.2.
* Has a history of hypertension, and is currently on antihypertensives, but has been held due to hypotension.
* Has a history of CAD, but cath revealed clean coronaries 6 months ago.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.2, and she has developed acute renal failure. This may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Hypotension: The patient's BP is still in the 70s-80s, which may lead to further complications such as organ damage, shock, and cardiovascular instability.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's urine lytes show FeNa 0.23, which may indicate electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and magnesium.
4. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's polymorphic VT may recur, and her hypotension may lead to further cardiovascular instability.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but her hypotension and acute renal failure may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's bowel regimen is stable, but her hypotension and acute renal failure may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Infections: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to her hypotension and acute renal failure, making her more susceptible to infections.

Assessment and Plan:

* Continue to hold antihypertensives, lasix, spironolactone, and valsartan due to acute renal failure.
* Encourage PO intake and consider gentle IVF if hypotensive and Cr does not improve.
* Monitor respiratory status and consider gentle IVF if lung exam shows no crackles.
* Restart dronedarone today and continue to hold Warfarin for INR 3.4.
* Replete K > 4.5 and Mg > 2.5.
* Monitor on telemetry and consider restarting coumadin for DVT prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient's condition is unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix to
   which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg x 1 on
   [**12-30**].  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s
   when sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**], and continued to be held on [**12-31**].  Unfortunately, in the setting
   of relative hypotension and receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg +
   80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were
   low, Cr bumped to 2.2 on [**12-31**], urine lytes showed Feurea of 13. Repeat
   urine lytes on [**12-31**] showedFeNa 0.23.  Patient was given 500cc bolus
   yesterday for creatinine of 2.6 and hypotension to 50s.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - get pm lytes
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.  Patient was
   hypotensive down to systolic 50s despite holding lasix, spironolactone
   and valsartan on [**12-31**].  Patient was mentating well, but does have end
   organ damage evidenced by actue renal failure.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who presented with acute onset of Shortness of Breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) requiring Internal Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD) shock. The patient has been experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension and the use of diuretics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.9°C, HR = 79 bpm, BP = 100/59 mmHg, RR = 16 breaths/min, SpO2 = 96%
* Respiratory support: None
* Cardiovascular: Atrial-paced rhythm, II/VI systolic flow murmur at the right upper sternal border
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatomegaly or bruits
* Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* Labs: Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) 27 mg/dL, Sodium 136 mmol/L, Potassium 4.7 mmol/L, Glucose 97 mg/dL

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, with systolic blood pressures in the 50s, and has been given 500cc of normal saline boluses twice. The patient's creatinine has improved to 2.1 mg/dL after the second bolus.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Acute renal failure leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis
* Hypotension leading to organ dysfunction and failure
* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output due to hypotension and diuretic use
* Infection and sepsis due to compromised immune function

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding diuretics, including Lasix, Spironolactone, and Valsartan, due to acute renal failure
* Encouraging oral intake and considering gentle IV fluids
* Monitoring electrolyte levels and repleting as necessary
* Avoiding renal toxins and adjusting medication dosing accordingly
* Trending renal function and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Restarting medications, including Dronedarone and Coumadin, once the patient's renal function has improved."

   to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging
   medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K
   3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely related to ischemia as patient has
   clean coronaries on cath 6 months ago, and no history of CAD.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix to
   which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg x 1 on
   [**12-30**].  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s
   when sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**], and continued to be held on [**12-31**].  Unfortunately, in the setting
   of relative hypotension and receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg +
   80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were
   low, Cr bumped to 2.2 on [**12-31**], urine lytes showed Feurea of 13. Repeat
   urine lytes on [**12-31**] showedFeNa 0.23.  Patient was given 500cc bolus
   yesterday for creatinine of 2.6 and hypotension to 50s.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM), who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, which has improved to 2.1 mg/dL after receiving 500cc NS boluses.
2. Hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 50s, which has not improved despite holding antihypertensives.
3. Decreased urine output (UOP) to nearly zero, which has improved slightly after receiving IV lasix.
4. Diastolic heart failure with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 70-80% on echocardiogram (TTE).
5. QTc prolongation, which is likely related to the patient's medication regimen and hypokalemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Progressive ARF, which can lead to further deterioration in renal function and increased risk of complications such as sepsis and multi-organ failure.
2. Hypotension, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, decreased perfusion of vital organs, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Decreased UOP, which can lead to acute tubular necrosis, increased risk of infection, and decreased ability to remove waste products from the body.
4. Diastolic heart failure, which can lead to increased risk of cardiac arrest, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of complications such as pulmonary edema.
5. QTc prolongation, which can lead to increased risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia.

The plan of care for the patient includes:

1. Holding antihypertensives, including lasix, spironolactone, and valsartan, due to ARF.
2. Encouraging PO intake to prevent further dehydration.
3. Considering gentle IVF (250cc bolus) if the patient remains hypotensive and Cr does not improve.
4. Trending renal function and monitoring for signs of worsening ARF.
5. Avoiding renal toxins and renally dosing medications.
6. Monitoring for signs of cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias.
7. Restarting coumadin and flecanide today, and repleting potassium and magnesium levels.
8. Continuing metoprolol 25mg and considering gentle IVF if the patient remains hypotensive and Cr does not improve.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is to be transferred to the floor once her condition improves."
