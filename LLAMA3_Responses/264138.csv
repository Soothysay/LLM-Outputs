You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC climbing gradually. Evident sepsis with
   hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal failure
   and respiratory compromise). Likely group A strep. Strep. Pneumoniae
   also possible. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC climbing gradually. Evident sepsis with
   hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal failure
   and respiratory compromise). Likely group A strep. Strep. Pneumoniae
   also possible. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C, COPD, and possible diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has a history of breast pain and a possible upper GI bleed. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, ascites, effusion, and empyema, which is likely secondary to a bacterial infection, possibly group A strep or Strep. Pneumoniae. She also has pancytopenia, likely related to Hepatitis C, and has a history of rib fractures and trauma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic condition is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ failure and death.
2. Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax: The patient's ascites and effusion/empyema/hemothorax may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac compromise.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be a sign of mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis, or an intrabdominal abscess, which could lead to further complications if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac compromise and death.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications and increased risk of infection.
6. Rib Fractures/Trauma: The patient's rib fractures and trauma may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
7. Diabetes/Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes/hypoglycemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as ketoacidosis and coma.
8. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if not properly managed, leading to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications and increased risk of infection.
10. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as encephalopathy and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Monitor the patient's ascites and effusion/empyema/hemothorax closely and consider therapeutic taps when feasible.
3. Manage the patient's abdominal pain with analgesics and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.
4. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with ventilatory support and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.
5. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia closely and consider transfusions when necessary.
6. Manage the patient's rib fractures and trauma with pain management and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.
7. Manage the patient's diabetes/hypoglycemia with insulin therapy and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.
8. Monitor the patient's acute kidney injury closely and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.
9. Manage the patient's coagulopathy with vitamin K and FFP therapy and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.
10. Manage the patient's liver failure with supportive care and consider further diagnostic testing to determine the cause.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust management accordingly to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash.
   # Abdominal pain: DDX: SBP, cholangitis, mesenteric ischemia, colitis,
   gastroenteritis, rash, atypical chest pain, worsening ascities,
   vasculitis, less likely splenomegaly or UTI.  Given patients history of
   N/V/D slightly favor infectious etiology, although concern for SBP is
   high.  Elevated lactate certainly concernign for mesenteric ischemia
   although lactate can be elevated by cirrhosis and may be falsely
   elevated.  Her pain may also be due to her rash (discussed below).
   -F/u final read of CT ab
   -F/u Tx [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   -Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Levo/flagyl/PO vanc for possible bacterial infectious
   etiology and tamiflu and acyclovir for posible viral etiology.
   -No evidence of cholangitis at this time on CT, continue to monitor.
   -D/w hepatology and transplant when and how to attempt para.  Given
   concern for cellulitis and small amount of ascities will be difficult.
   -ROMI
   -F/U urine Cx
   -Consult ID: Abx and anti-virals. Would she be candidate for IVIG
   (toxim mediated disease).
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in the setting of COPD
   exacerbation, volume overload with anasarca and possible infectious
   process.  B/l infiltrates on CXR, Likely not in florid heart failure,
   PaO2:FiO2 = 110.  Meets definition for ARDS.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   -Rule out influenza - treat until negative given ILI, COPD and ICU.
   -Given BP will hold on diurese, but likely will need to remove volume
   -consider thoracentesis
   -wean vent as tolerated - RISBI in am.
   # SIRS/Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and
   tachypnea (WBC low, but chronic).  Sources for infection include
   pneumonia, SBP, colitis, less likely meningitis.  Also less likely
   toxic shock syndrome.  Will classify and treat patient currently as
   septic shock given her low BP.  Continue broad spectrum antibiotics as
   above.  Consider broadening viral or fungal coverage if not improving.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated.
   -Continue to search for an infection
   -F/u blood Cx
   -F/u Urine Cx
   -Discuss with teams consulted best way to sample ascities.
   -Continue broad spectrum anti-microbials: Vanc/levo/flagyl/tamiflu
   -MAP > 60
   -FLuid bolus and pressors as needed
   -UOP > 30cc/hr
   -CVP > 12
   -Will make sure patient does not have a tampon in place.
   # Rash: DDX: cellulitis, vasculitis, viral rash, zoster, cuteneous
   cryoglobulinemia, possible nec fascitiis, (although no crepitus on exam
   and no gas in subQ tissue on CT)alt may be DIC.  Lastly this may be
   sequelea of inflected or self inflicted harm and some of rash may be
   attributable to trauma.  This is possible given location of some of the
   lesions (breast) and Fx ribs seen on CT.  Given patients leukopenia and
   neutropenia, am concerned for potential disseminated zoster.  Patient
   never tested for cryos and possible her ILI preceeding her ED visit was
   part of cryos.  Still given other concerns, need to cover now for
   possible bacterial cellulis.
   -Vancomycin
   -Derm consult for skin Bx
   -Cryo level in am
   -HSV 1&2 serologies
   -VSV serolgies.
   -consider starting acyclovir
   -trend DIC labs q2 overnight.
   # Cirrhosis: Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.
   Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in
   ED.  Her liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili
   elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27.
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Treat other conditions overnight
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose overnight.
   -Pending OG tube residuals may re-start.
   # Positive U/A: Potential etiology of above problems.
   -F/u Cx
   -Foley in
   -ABX per above
   # Right pleural effusion: Likely related to anasarca.  Other
   possibilities are hemothorax.  Will hold on [**Female First Name (un) 231**] given coagulopathy.
   # Pancytopenia: Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.
   Patient reports being HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV
   documented.  Hct is slightly lower then prior, history of melena 1 week
   ago.  Given rash, also concern for DIC or hemolytic anemia (given rise
   in bili).  Currently not in DIC based on labs.  Will trend.
   -Trend CBC
   -monitor for DIC
   -hapto
   -retic
   -Hold heparin in setting of low plts
   # Rib Fractures/trauma: No history of trauma.  Concerns are for falls
   or trauma while intoxicated or abuse.  Ecchymosis seen on exam
   (shoulder and back).  Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.
   Trauma was consulted in ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -F/U trauma recs
   -Obtain further history when able
   -[**Location (un) 239**]-J
   # DM/Hypoglycmia: Patient with unclear history of diabetes.  Per
   previous d/c sum there was some concern of serepticious insulin
   injection.  C-peptide however was high at that time.  Patients Hb A1c
   was 5.  No clear evidence DM at this time.
   -ISS
   # History of melena: Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed
   in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Elevated intra-abdominal pressure:  Elevated to 40.  Concern for
   abdominal compartment syndrome.
   -Monitor for now.  D/W transplant [**Doctor First Name **] significnace and possible need
   for abdominal fasciotomy.
   # Oliguria: Pre-renal, [**1-24**] abdomainal compartment syndrome, ATN.
   -Send urine lytes
   -bolus NS
   -monitor ab pressures.
   # Bilious OG tube drainage: No clear obstruction on CT.  Contrast
   passed to colon.  Paitent S/p cholecystectomy.
   -intermittent suction overnight.  Trial of OG in am.
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes (patient with low K, secondary to
   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash.
   # Abdominal pain: DDX: SBP, cholangitis, mesenteric ischemia, colitis,
   gastroenteritis, rash, atypical chest pain, worsening ascities,
   vasculitis, less likely splenomegaly or UTI.  Given patients history of
   N/V/D slightly favor infectious etiology, although concern for SBP is
   high.  Elevated lactate certainly concernign for mesenteric ischemia
   although lactate can be elevated by cirrhosis and may be falsely
   elevated.  Her pain may also be due to her rash (discussed below).
   -F/u final read of CT ab
   -F/u Tx [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   -Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 1540**]/Levo/flagyl/PO vanc for possible bacterial infectious
   etiology and tamiflu and acyclovir for posible viral etiology.
   -No evidence of cholangitis at this time on CT, continue to monitor.
   -D/w hepatology and transplant when and how to attempt para.  Given
   concern for cellulitis and small amount of ascities will be difficult.
   -ROMI
   -F/U urine Cx
   -Consult ID: Abx and anti-virals. Would she be candidate for IVIG
   (toxim mediated disease).
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial in the setting of COPD
   exacerbation, volume overload with anasarca and possible infectious
   process.  B/l infiltrates on CXR, Likely not in florid heart failure,
   PaO2:FiO2 = 110.  Meets definition for ARDS.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   -Rule out influenza - treat until negative given ILI, COPD and ICU.
   -Given BP will hold on diurese, but likely will need to remove volume
   -consider thoracentesis
   -wean vent as tolerated - RISBI in am.
   # SIRS/Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and
   tachypnea (WBC low, but chronic).  Sources for infection include
   pneumonia, SBP, colitis, less likely meningitis.  Also less likely
   toxic shock syndrome.  Will classify and treat patient currently as
   septic shock given her low BP.  Continue broad spectrum antibiotics as
   above.  Consider broadening viral or fungal coverage if not improving.
   -Wean pressors as tolerated.
   -Continue to search for an infection
   -F/u blood Cx
   -F/u Urine Cx
   -Discuss with teams consulted best way to sample ascities.
   -Continue broad spectrum anti-microbials: Vanc/levo/flagyl/tamiflu
   -MAP > 60
   -FLuid bolus and pressors as needed
   -UOP > 30cc/hr
   -CVP > 12
   -Will make sure patient does not have a tampon in place.
   # Rash: DDX: cellulitis, vasculitis, viral rash, zoster, cuteneous
   cryoglobulinemia, possible nec fascitiis, (although no crepitus on exam
   and no gas in subQ tissue on CT)alt may be DIC.  Lastly this may be
   sequelea of inflected or self inflicted harm and some of rash may be
   attributable to trauma.  This is possible given location of some of the
   lesions (breast) and Fx ribs seen on CT.  Given patients leukopenia and
   neutropenia, am concerned for potential disseminated zoster.  Patient
   never tested for cryos and possible her ILI preceeding her ED visit was
   part of cryos.  Still given other concerns, need to cover now for
   possible bacterial cellulis.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and possible type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has a history of melena and breast pain. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the SIRS criteria and has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her compromised immune system and presence of multiple comorbidities.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has COPD exacerbation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient has oliguria and elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has elevated intra-abdominal pressure, which may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome.
5. Hepatic decompensation: The patient's liver function is compromised, and there is a high risk of hepatic decompensation.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate coagulopathy.
7. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which may indicate pancytopenia.
8. DIC: The patient has a high risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to her compromised immune system and presence of multiple comorbidities.
9. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has a high risk of developing hemolytic anemia due to her compromised immune system and presence of multiple comorbidities.

Plan:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications.
2. Monitor for sepsis and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Manage respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Monitor for renal failure and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome and consider abdominal decompression if necessary.
6. Monitor for hepatic decompensation and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Monitor for coagulopathy and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Monitor for pancytopenia and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Monitor for DIC and hemolytic anemia and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Consider consulting with specialists, such as a hepatologist and a pulmonologist, to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC climbing gradually. Evident sepsis with
   hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal failure
   and respiratory compromise). Likely group A strep. Strep. Pneumoniae
   also possible. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 40 YO F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ?DM, depression who
   presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week
   ago, breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC climbing gradually. Evident sepsis with
   hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal failure
   and respiratory compromise). Likely group A strep. Strep. Pneumoniae
   also possible. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and possible diabetes. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has a history of breast pain and has been experiencing symptoms for approximately one week.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Cirrhosis with portal hypertension and ascites
* Hepatitis C with elevated liver enzymes
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic bronchitis and emphysema
* Possible diabetes with a history of hypoglycemic events
* Depression
* History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin)
* Coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) secondary to liver failure

The patient's condition is complicated by:

* Sepsis with a high cardiac output state and organ failure
* Respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Abdominal compartment syndrome with increased intravesicular pressure
* Renal failure with acute kidney injury
* Coagulopathy with a risk of bleeding
* Pancytopenia with a risk of infection

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Empyema (infection of the lung)
* Hemothorax (bleeding in the chest)
* Abdominal abscess
* Sepsis-induced organ failure
* Respiratory failure
* Coagulopathy-related bleeding
* Pancytopenia-related infection
* Acute kidney injury
* Liver failure

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics to cover possible infections
* Pressors to maintain blood pressure
* Ventilation to support respiratory function
* Fluid management to prevent fluid overload
* Pain management with opioids
* Nutritional support with IV fluids and nutrition
* Monitoring for signs of infection and organ failure

Potential future treatment options may include:

* Thoracentesis to drain fluid from the chest
* Abdominal tap to drain fluid from the abdomen
* Liver transplant
* Kidney transplant
* Hemodialysis
* Mechanical ventilation
* Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

The patient's condition is unstable and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU with septic shock, persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, and a bullous abdominal rash. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is not fully controlled, as evidenced by the persistently elevated lactate levels. This increases the risk of organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160, indicating severe hypoxemia. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is sluggish, which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). This increases the risk of renal failure and potential need for dialysis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is worsening, as evidenced by the increasing bilirubin and INR levels. This may increase the risk of liver failure and potential need for liver transplantation.
6. Infection: The patient has a bullous abdominal rash and GPCs growing from the blood, which may indicate a severe infection.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are low, which may increase the risk of hypoglycemic episodes.
8. Hepatitis: The patient has chronic viral hepatitis, which may increase the risk of liver failure and potential need for liver transplantation.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Septic shock management: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics and vasopressors to manage septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure management: The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to manage respiratory failure.
3. Oliguria management: The patient's urine output will be closely monitored, and further interventions will be considered if necessary.
4. Coagulopathy management: The patient will continue to receive anticoagulant therapy to manage coagulopathy.
5. Cirrhosis management: The patient's cirrhosis will be closely monitored, and further interventions will be considered if necessary.
6. Infection management: The patient's infection will be further evaluated and treated as necessary.
7. Hypoglycemia management: The patient's glucose levels will be closely monitored, and further interventions will be considered if necessary.
8. Hepatitis management: The patient's hepatitis will be closely monitored, and further interventions will be considered if necessary.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely related
   with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less likely
   hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
   - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely related
   with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less likely
   hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
   - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications have arisen or are being considered:

1. Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia: The patient has a severe infection, which is likely contributing to their hypotension, organ failure, and respiratory distress.
2. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient has ascites and a high vesicular pressure, which increases the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is likely related to their underlying pneumonia/infection and large pleural effusion.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low blood counts, which are likely related to their underlying liver disease and possible bone marrow suppression.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a bleeding disorder, which is likely secondary to their liver failure and may be exacerbated by their medications.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has low urine output and is at risk of developing acute tubular necrosis.
7. Bilious OG Tube Drainage: The patient has a bilious OG tube drainage, which may be related to a bowel obstruction or ileus.
8. Trauma: The patient has rib fractures and ecchymoses on exam, which may be related to trauma.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had hypoglycemic events and may have insulinoma or other causes of hypoglycemia.
10. Liver Decompensation: The patient's liver function is decreased, which may be related to their underlying liver disease and may lead to further decompensation.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving meropenem for their sepsis and strep pneumo bacteremia.
2. Fluid Management: The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and they are not receiving fluids at this time.
3. Respiratory Support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being treated for ARDS.
4. Pain Management: The patient is receiving pain management with fentanyl.
5. Nutrition: The patient is receiving IV nutrition and is being monitored for glycemic control.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
7. Liver Management: The patient's liver function is being closely monitored, and they are being followed by the hepatology team.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC gradually downtrending. Evident sepsis
   with hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal
   failure and respiratory compromise). Likely [**1-24**] strep. pneumoniae from
   culture data. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, stopped linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down
   tidal volume and rate; increased FiO2
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis
   Meets SIRS criteria and now WBC gradually downtrending. Evident sepsis
   with hypotension, high cardiac output state, organ failure (renal
   failure and respiratory compromise). Likely [**1-24**] strep. pneumoniae from
   culture data. Broadly covered at present, and with help of ID, pending
   speciation and sensitivities. Also E. coli in urine culture but not in
   blood. Meropenem and linezolid per ID. Need to also consider empyema
   and SBT.
   - Meropenem, stopped linezolid (stopped other ABx yesterday: Vanc/
   Levo/flagyl/PO vanc)
   - Maintain perfusion, MAP > 65 with pressors PRN (on norepi and
   vasopressin at the moment), CVP > 12
   # Ascites and Effusion/Empyema/Hemothorax
   Both possibly septic, but risky at present to perform diagnostic taps
   given coagulopathy. Will get another US today and mark spot. Unlikely
   that coags will shift much with vitamin K or FFP.
   - US abdomen to mark spot and follow ascites
   - Monitor intravesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] at present with concern for
   abdominal compartment
   - ARDS ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down
   tidal volume and rate; increased FiO2
   # Abdominal pain
   Given high lactate, concern for mesenteric ischemia > peritonitis.
   Alternatively intrabdominal abcess versus SBT. Also possible colitis
   with bowel thickening on CT
 unclear significance at present. Lactate
   persists in part, no doubt, due to liver failure, but seems quite high
   for this. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis. Possible
   toxin mediated with GAS.
   - Continue IVIG, D/w ID
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Therapeutic tap when feasible
   - Follow US/CT if change
   - Monitor vesicular pressure
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Given good CO and SVV will hold off
   on fluids for now.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Given good CO and SVV will hold off
   on fluids for now.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely related
   with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less likely
   hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
   - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely related
   with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less likely
   hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
   - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
   -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Thoracentesis when feasible (see above)
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   - Given incomplete expiration (COPD contributing) reduce rate and
   possibly minute ventilation slightly to prevent autopeep.
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps GAS,
   s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C, COPD, and possible diabetes. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and possible breast pain and rash, which is likely related to streptococcal pneumonia. She has developed sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She has also experienced coagulopathy, pancytopenia, and hypoglycemia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is critically ill, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and death if not managed promptly and aggressively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. Prolonged ventilation can lead to respiratory muscle weakness and increased risk of respiratory failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and she is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely secondary to liver failure, which can lead to bleeding complications if not managed promptly.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to her Hepatitis C infection and can increase her risk of bleeding and infection.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is likely related to her diabetes and can lead to neurological damage if not managed promptly.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has ascites and a large pleural effusion, which can increase her risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome.
8. Empyema: The patient has a large pleural effusion, which can increase her risk of developing empyema.
9. Liver decompensation: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she is at risk of developing liver decompensation if not managed promptly.
10. Infection: The patient has multiple comorbidities, which can increase her risk of developing infection.

ICU management:

The patient requires intensive care unit (ICU) management to address her multiple comorbidities and complications. The ICU team should focus on:

1. Managing sepsis: The patient should receive prompt and aggressive management of sepsis, including antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors.
2. Improving respiratory function: The patient should receive mechanical ventilation and respiratory support to improve her respiratory function.
3. Managing acute kidney injury: The patient should receive aggressive fluid management and diuretic therapy to manage her acute kidney injury.
4. Managing coagulopathy: The patient should receive vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to manage her coagulopathy.
5. Managing pancytopenia: The patient should receive blood transfusions and platelet transfusions as needed to manage her pancytopenia.
6. Managing hypoglycemia: The patient should receive regular insulin sliding scale therapy to manage her hypoglycemia.
7. Monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient should be monitored for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome, including increasing abdominal pressure and decreased urine output.
8. Managing empyema: The patient should receive antibiotic therapy and thoracentesis to manage her empyema.
9. Managing liver decompensation: The patient should receive lactulose and other medications to manage her liver decompensation.
10. Monitoring for infection: The patient should be monitored for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and increased inflammation markers."

   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Given good CO and SVV will hold off
   on fluids for now.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite likely will
   develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures. UOP slightly
   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Dermatology recommended to continue to follow viral/fluid cultures,
   to leave overlying skin intact if bullae rupture, and to continue to
   dress with gauze and with daily dressing changes.
   - ID recommended continuing meropenem and acyclovir as unclear whether
   rash is Zoster and would continue coverage. They recommend tapping when
   able.
   - Hepatology recommended continued supportive care, meropenem and
   acyclovir. They noted ascitic tap not required as empiric treatment
   with meropenem.
   - Cardiology echo ordered for cardiomegaly seen on CXR. It was not

   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
   - Discontinue IVIG
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P:F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Given good CO and SVV will hold off
   on fluids for now.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 no fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - RSBI today
   - SBT unlikely today given sedation and respiratory distress
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.

   improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and possible diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction, and is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia and bacteremia. She has also been diagnosed with ascites, pleural effusion, and pancytopenia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL and a rate of 32 breaths per minute. She has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 132.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypotension and is receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions to support her blood pressure.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury and is receiving IV fluids and diuretics to manage her fluid status.
* Hepatic: The patient has cirrhosis and is experiencing liver failure, with an INR of 2.7 and a total bilirubin level of 12.7 mg/dL.
* Hematologic: The patient has pancytopenia, with a white blood cell count of 5.8 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 38 x 10^9/L, and a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis-related organ failure: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ failure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Liver failure: The patient's liver failure may worsen her coagulopathy and increase her risk of bleeding.
* Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding and infection.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen her fluid status and increase her risk of developing acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
* Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's ascites and pleural effusion may increase her risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome.
* Toxic shock syndrome: The patient's sepsis may lead to toxic shock syndrome, which can be life-threatening.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
* Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor infusions, and IV fluids.
* Consider early goal-directed care to improve the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory status.
* Continue to follow the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider transfusions if necessary.
* Consider antibiotic therapy to treat the patient's pneumonia and bacteremia.
* Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's respiratory and abdominal status.
* Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or a gastroenterologist, to help manage the patient's respiratory and abdominal status."

   - ID recommended continuing meropenem and acyclovir as unclear whether
   rash is Zoster and would continue coverage. They recommend tapping when
   able.
   - Hepatology recommended continued supportive care, meropenem and
   acyclovir. They noted ascitic tap not required as empiric treatment
   with meropenem.
   - Cardiology echo ordered for cardiomegaly seen on CXR. It was not

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   ---------
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite
   likely will develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures.
   UOP slightly improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible.

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - ID recommended continuing meropenem and acyclovir as unclear whether
   rash is Zoster and would continue coverage. They recommend tapping when
   able.
   - Hepatology recommended continued supportive care, meropenem and
   acyclovir. They noted ascitic tap not required as empiric treatment
   with meropenem.
   - Cardiology echo ordered for cardiomegaly seen on CXR. It was not

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   ---------
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output. Quite
   likely will develop ATN, depending on sub-acute course and pressures.
   UOP slightly improved this a.m. at time > 30 cc/hr.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible.

   diarrhea?), OG tube in, nutrition consult in am.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, and a history of depression who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has a complicated medical history, including a recent breast pain and possible hepatitis C infection.

The patient's current condition is critical, with sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She has a bilateral pleural effusion and a large amount of ascites, which is likely related to her cirrhosis. She also has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a urine culture for Escherichia coli.

The patient is receiving antibiotics, including meropenem, and is being treated for ARDS with low tidal volume and low rate ventilation. She is also receiving supportive care, including vasopressin and norepinephrine, and is being monitored for fluid status.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with a high white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and a low platelet count. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and transaminase levels.

The patient's medical history is significant for cirrhosis, COPD, and a history of depression. She has also had a recent breast pain and possible hepatitis C infection.

The patient's current condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's family should be informed of her condition and the treatment plan, and they should be encouraged to ask questions and provide input on her care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and there is a risk of further decline in her oxygenation.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely to progress if not managed aggressively.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further infection.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are normal, but there is a risk of hypoglycemia due to her liver failure and sepsis.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and there is a risk of further imbalance.

The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted to address these potential complications, and she should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bloody OG tube drainage
   Some bloody tube feed evacuated this a.m. Resolved spontaneous late in
   a.m. Likely related to thrombocytopenia.
   - Continue tube feeds with brief gentle intermittent suction to
   evaluate for further bleeding.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bloody OG tube drainage
   Some bloody tube feed evacuated this a.m. Resolved spontaneous late in
   a.m. Likely related to thrombocytopenia.
   - Continue tube feeds with brief gentle intermittent suction to
   evaluate for further bleeding.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, breast pain, and a rash. She has a history of broken ribs and has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, and pleural effusion. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to her underlying COPD and pneumonia, and may require continued mechanical ventilation.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion may require drainage or thoracentesis to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to her cirrhosis, ascites, or other underlying conditions, and may require further evaluation and management.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be related to her liver failure and may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
7. Opioid dependence: The patient's opioid dependence may require continued management and treatment.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may require continued monitoring and management.
9. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may require continued monitoring and management.
10. Bloody OG tube drainage: The patient's bloody OG tube drainage may require further evaluation and management.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's primary issues are sepsis, respiratory failure, and pleural effusion. She requires continued mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. She also requires further evaluation and management of her abdominal pain, coagulopathy, pancytopenia, and opioid dependence. Her hyponatremia and acute kidney injury require continued monitoring and management. Her bloody OG tube drainage requires further evaluation and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Currently with continued hypotension necessitating pressor requirement,
   in a high cardiac output state and also with organ failure (renal and
   respiratory compromise). Likely related with strep pneumo bacteremia.
   Other sources to consider include empyema, SBT. Also with E. coli in
   urine but no in blood.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
    - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
    Stable. Lactate downtrending, with continued abdominal pain on exam.
   Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis initially, although
   lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation may also have been
   secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely that levels would
   have peaked so high solely due to this). SBT possible given ascites,
   although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed colitis,
   negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and cirrhosis, no
   venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin mediated at this
   time.
    - Discontinue IVIG
    - Continue antibiotics as above
    - Defer diagnostic paracentesis at this time
 no pocket of ascites
   seen on bedside ultrasound and coagulopathy
   - Monitor vesicular pressure [**Hospital1 **] concern for abdominal compartment
   syndrome
    # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
    Meets criteria for ARDS although mechanism and pathology likely
   related with underlying pneumonia/infection. Concern for empyema, less
   likely hemothorax although under consideration given coagulopathy.
    - Continue ARDS low tidal volume and low rate ventilation given fairly
   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
    # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
    -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
    -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   No fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   # Rash
    Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps
   GAS, s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output, hypoalbuminemia.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Some concern about DIC. Unlikely
   response to vitamin K and FFP would not get us far.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal volume and rate; increased
   FiO2
    # Respiratory Failure
   Contributions by possible infection and large empyema versus effusion.
   In addition septic respiratory distress likely. Respiratory status
   improving overnight. Now off toxic O2 at 50%. ABGs actually improving
   at present. Edema not likely playing a role at this point with low SVV,
   however CVP is lower. Given good CO and SVV will hold off on fluids for
   now.
    -Ventilate with ARDSnet protocol.
    -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   No fluid or diuresis for now.
   - Wean vent as tolerated
 wean O2 to 40% if possible, maintain ARDSnet
   for now.
   # Rash
    Vesicular with PMNs only so far. Either sterile bacterial, perhaps
   GAS, s/p antibiotic, or viral VZV. Await DFA
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as
   well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score
   of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   -F/u hepatology recs.
   -Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix and lactulose for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w family/HCP HIV test
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl.
   -Obtain further history when able
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and C-peptide, although
   not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5. Consider insulinoma and
   other DDx today
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history recently.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 25
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Likely very hypoperfused with low urine output, hypoalbuminemia.
   - Calculate FeUrea
   # Bilious OG tube drainage
   No clear obstruction on CT, but likely ileus now with sedation.
   Contrast passed to colon. Suctioning less material now.
   - Turn off suction and trial OG
   # Coagulopathy
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Some concern about DIC. Unlikely
   response to vitamin K and FFP would not get us far.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with cirrhosis due to Hepatitis C, COPD, and a possible history of diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has a history of broken ribs and is currently on pressors for hypotension. Her vital signs are stable, but she has organ failure, including renal and respiratory compromise. She has a high cardiac output state and is at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying liver disease, COPD, and possible pneumonia.
2. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdominal pain, ascites, and coagulopathy make her at risk for developing abdominal compartment syndrome.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and possible pneumonia.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level make her at risk for bleeding and infection.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to her liver disease and may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and coagulopathy make her at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated lipase level make her at risk for developing pancreatitis.
8. Intestinal Ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain, ascites, and coagulopathy make her at risk for developing intestinal ischemia.
9. Sepsis-Induced Kidney Injury: The patient's sepsis and coagulopathy make her at risk for developing sepsis-induced kidney injury.
10. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's immobility and coagulopathy make her at risk for developing pulmonary embolism.

Treatment Plan:

1. Continue meropenem for sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment as needed.
3. Continue pressors for hypotension.
4. Monitor for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue respiratory support and adjust as needed.
6. Monitor for signs of bleeding and infection and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Follow up with hepatology and liver clinic for further evaluation and management of liver disease.
8. Monitor for signs of hepatic encephalopathy and adjust treatment as needed.
9. Continue nutrition and hydration support.
10. Monitor for signs of pancreatitis and adjust treatment as needed.
11. Monitor for signs of intestinal ischemia and adjust treatment as needed.
12. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia

 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bloody OG tube drainage
   Some bloody tube feed evacuated this a.m. Resolved spontaneous late in
   a.m. Likely related to thrombocytopenia.
   - Continue tube feeds with brief gentle intermittent suction to
   evaluate for further bleeding.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Methadone 20 mg IV q8h started
   - Called methadone clinic, but no-one actually on call. Will call back
   on Monday a.m. to confrim dose of methadone (70 mg PO QD in recent DC
   summary). Contact: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10567**]
   - Added LFTs, lipase, amylase due to prolonged propofol: Broadly stable
   from previous day, but worsened from admission. Will need to follow
   intermittantly.
   - Lactate seems to track ppO2 in blood gas. Worsened along with blood
   gas when decreased O2 from 60% to 50%.
   - Gave bolus of 500 cc when UOP fell -

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting complaint and not really adequately addressed by primary
   issue at present. Concern for mesenteric ischemia, peritonitis
   initially, although lactate resolving at this time (part of elevation
   may also have been secondary to liver failure, although seems unlikely
   that levels would have peaked so high solely due to this). Need to
   remain sensitive to possibility of abscess also. SBT possible given
   ascites, although unlikely to present in this manner. CT showed
   colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US ascites and
   cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy. Unlikely toxin
   mediated at this time.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider follow US/CT if change in clinical status
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Lost A-line so no vigileo. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Continue to rethink fluid status
 only boluses as indicated by UOP
   and pressure at present
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today and trial O2 of 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   # Cirrhosis
   Appears slightly more jaundiced today. Secondary to Hep C, possible
   also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver synthetic function is
   decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   decompensation of already poor liver.  Currently CP score of C. MELD
   27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in

   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   # Bloody OG tube drainage
   Some bloody tube feed evacuated this a.m. Resolved spontaneous late in
   a.m. Likely related to thrombocytopenia.
   - Continue tube feeds with brief gentle intermittent suction to
   evaluate for further bleeding.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved to 131 now that meds in NS where possible instead of D5. Liver
   failure also likely responsible

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes, who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a diagnosis of sepsis and bacteremia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. She also has ascites, pleural effusion, and pancytopenia. She is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and bacteremia: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis and bacteremia due to the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in her blood.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and pleural effusion.
3. Abdominal complications: The patient has ascites and a risk of developing abscesses or peritonitis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is compromised, and there is a risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia and an elevated INR, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which may increase the risk of infection.
7. Kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving tube feeds, but there is a risk of malnutrition and deficiencies.
9. Opioid dependence: The patient is receiving methadone, and there is a risk of opioid dependence and withdrawal.
10. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemic events and is at risk of developing hypoglycemia.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications as needed. The patient will be monitored for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and other complications. The plan also includes ongoing nutritional support, pain management, and close monitoring of her liver function."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Repeat Blood Cultures today.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting symptom. No clear etiology to explain at this time. Treating
   for SBT. CT showed colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US
   ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider CT abdomen if scan chest.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepetology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, reassess hypoxia with volume down.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02 to 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Methadone 20 mg IV q8h started
   - Called methadone clinic, but no-one actually on call. Will call back
   on Monday a.m. to confrim dose of methadone (70 mg PO QD in recent DC
   summary). Contact: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10567**]
   - Added LFTs, lipase, amylase due to prolonged propofol: Broadly stable
   from previous day, but worsened from admission. Will need to follow
   intermittantly.
   - Lactate seems to track ppO2 in blood gas. Worsened along with blood
   gas when decreased O2 from 60% to 50%.
   - Gave bolus of 500 cc when UOP fell -

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Repeat Blood Cultures today.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting symptom. No clear etiology to explain at this time. Treating
   for SBT. CT showed colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US
   ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider CT abdomen if scan chest.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepetology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, reassess hypoxia with volume down.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02 to 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.

She has respiratory failure and sepsis, with a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae. She also has pancytopenia, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal. She has a history of opioid dependence and is currently receiving methadone.

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and her sepsis is being treated with antibiotics.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to her cirrhosis and may be caused by ascites, colitis, or other underlying conditions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She also has a pleural effusion, which may be related to her sepsis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to her cirrhosis and may be caused by bone marrow suppression.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to her liver failure.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to her liver failure and vasopressin therapy.
7. Opioid dependence: The patient has a history of opioid dependence and is currently receiving methadone.
8. DM/Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemic events and may have DM.
9. Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]: The patient has a history of upper GI bleed and may have a bleeding disorder.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
2. Respiratory failure and ARDS
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome
4. Coagulopathy-related bleeding
5. Pancytopenia-related infection
6. Hyponatremia-related seizures
7. Opioid withdrawal symptoms
8. DM-related hypoglycemia
9. Crit fall-related bleeding

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for sepsis, mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, and management of her abdominal pain, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and hyponatremia. She will also receive nutrition support and monitoring for potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Repeat Blood Cultures today.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting symptom. No clear etiology to explain at this time. Treating
   for SBT. CT showed colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US
   ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider CT abdomen if scan chest.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepetology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, reassess hypoxia with volume down.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02 to 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 132 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible [**Month/Day (2) 10530**] 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures.
   - Repeat Blood Cultures today.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal pain, Ascites
   Presenting symptom. No clear etiology to explain at this time. Treating
   for SBT. CT showed colitis, negative for intrabdominal abscess. RUQ US
   ascites and cirrhosis, no venous thrombosis, s/p cholecystectomy.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider CT abdomen if scan chest.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepetology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, reassess hypoxia with volume down.
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02 to 50%
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Crit fall/History of [**Name (NI) **]
   Unclear history.  Has had upper GI bleed in past.
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -trend hct
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   # Coagulopathy
 Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
   Likely secondary to liver failure. Unlikely response to vitamin K and
   FFP would not get us far. Thrombocytopenia
 partly of liver failure,
   but more likely related to other cell lines being depressed. Should
   test for HIV when possible.
   - Follow
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 132 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes who was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, breast pain, and a rash. She has respiratory failure and sepsis, with a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae. She also has ascites, pleural effusion, and a coagulopathy, which is likely secondary to liver failure. The patient has a history of rib fractures, trauma, and opioid dependence, and is currently being treated for acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae and her respiratory failure and sepsis indicate a high risk of sepsis.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's cirrhosis, elevated INR, and thrombocytopenia suggest a high risk of liver failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure and pleural effusion indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, likely secondary to liver failure, increases her risk of bleeding.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury and hyponatremia indicate a high risk of further kidney damage.
6. Opioid Dependence: The patient's opioid dependence and history of trauma increase her risk of opioid overdose and addiction.
7. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia, likely secondary to liver failure, increases her risk of bleeding and infection.
8. Rib Fractures: The patient's rib fractures and history of trauma increase her risk of further injury and respiratory compromise.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hypoglycemic events and her current treatment with insulin and glucagon increase her risk of hypoglycemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungal agents as indicated by the patient's blood culture results.
3. Continue to treat the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk, and consider transfusing blood products as needed.
5. Continue to treat the patient's liver failure with lactulose and consider referral to a liver transplant center.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
7. Consider referral to a pain management specialist to address the patient's opioid dependence.
8. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and consider transfusing blood products as needed.
9. Consider referral to a trauma specialist to address the patient's rib fractures and history of trauma."

      VARICELLA-ZOSTER CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD.
   - Would consider broadening coverage to include Vancomycin.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Overnight LFTs increased drastically.
   Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in the setting of
   acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02
   # Blood Per OG Tube: [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). Question need for EGD to
   eval etiology of bleed.
   - Appreciate Hepatology Recs.
   - Q6 Hr HCT
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   - Platelets >20, FFP to decrease INR
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative. Viral Culture
   preliminary negative.
   - DC Acyclovir
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Bicarb/Mucomyst prior to CT with contrast.
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 133 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Overnight LFTs increased drastically.
   Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in the setting of
   acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02
   # Blood Per OG Tube: [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix

   - Platelets >20, FFP to decrease INR
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative. Viral Culture
   preliminary negative.
   - DC Acyclovir
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Bicarb/Mucomyst prior to CT with contrast.
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 133 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, and COPD who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She was admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis, and has developed several complications, including transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, and blood loss from her nasogastric tube. She has also developed pancytopenia, rib fractures, and opioid dependence.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, and she requires mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a large pleural effusion, which is causing respiratory distress and may require thoracentesis.
4. Blood Loss: The patient has significant blood loss from her nasogastric tube, which may lead to hypovolemic shock and require blood transfusions.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is causing her to be at risk for bleeding and infection, and may require platelet transfusions.
6. Rib Fractures: The patient's rib fractures are causing her significant pain and may lead to respiratory compromise if not managed properly.
7. Opioid Dependence: The patient is opioid-dependent and may require ongoing management of her pain and withdrawal symptoms.
8. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may require dialysis and close monitoring of her electrolyte levels.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may require treatment with hypertonic saline and close monitoring of her sodium levels.
10. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure is causing her to be at risk for bleeding and may require ongoing management of her coagulopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics as prescribed to treat the patient's sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Adjust the patient's mechanical ventilation settings to optimize her respiratory function.
3. Consider thoracentesis to drain the patient's pleural effusion and improve her respiratory function.
4. Monitor the patient's blood loss and transfuse blood products as needed to maintain her hemodynamic stability.
5. Manage the patient's pancytopenia with platelet transfusions and close monitoring of her bleeding risk.
6. Provide pain management with opioids and other analgesics as needed to manage the patient's pain.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as needed to manage her acute kidney injury and hyponatremia.
8. Consider liver transplantation as a potential treatment option for the patient's liver failure.
9. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust her medication regimen as needed to manage her bleeding risk.
10. Provide ongoing psychological support to the patient and her family to manage the patient's opioid dependence and other mental health concerns."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and severe hypoxemia. She has a bullous abdominal rash and growths from the blood. The patient has not made significant clinical progress and remains hypoxemic and pressor-dependent.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Septic shock with S. pneumo bacteremia
2. Respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia
3. Oliguria with urine output improving with MAP > 70
4. Cirrhosis with rising LFTs and LDH, possibly related to GI bleed
5. GI bleed with ongoing monitoring of Hct and NGT output
6. Impaired skin integrity with abdominal rash and weeping lesions
7. Altered mental status with no clear cause
8. Electrolyte and fluid disorder
9. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)
10. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 3.7-7.1 K/uL
* Hct: 27.5-28.3%
* Plt: 24-37 K/uL
* Cr: 1.2-1.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 28-30 mmHg
* Glucose: 147-157 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Amylase/Lipase, Differential-Neuts, D-dimer, Fibrinogen, Lactic Acid, Albumin, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, PO4

The patient's plan includes:

* Septic shock management with ongoing monitoring of lactate and vasopressor therapy
* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and PEEP
* Oliguria management with MAP > 70
* Cirrhosis management with monitoring of LFTs and LDH
* GI bleed management with monitoring of Hct and NGT output
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Nutrition and glycemic control management

The patient's prognosis remains guarded due to her critical illness and multiple comorbidities."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl  and meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**],
   stopped vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Fungemia: One blood culture. Will Identify type over next 48 hours.
   -          Optho today
   -          Change to Micafungin until speciation.
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Transaminitis improved overnight.
   Bilirubin continues to increase. Indirect bilirubin stable and within
   normal limits. Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on PSupport for today. Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   # Blood Per OG Tube: Resolved this AM with correction of patients
   coagulopathy. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). NO EGD indicated for oozing.
   - Appreciate Hepatology Recs.
   - Q8 Hr HCT
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -Tx at less than 25 or if symptomatic
   - Platelets >50, FFP to decrease INR <2
   # Rash
   Improved greatly overnight on IV Vancomycin. Vesicular with PMNs only
   so far. DFA negative. Viral Culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Mental Status: Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and
   Propofol. Pt unresponsive to voice. Does withdrawl to pain.
   - Follow, Minimize sedation/benzos.
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Improved with fluid yesterday and better MAP.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Bicarb/Mucomyst prior to CT with contrast.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Sepsis, Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Obtained CT head and CT torso with contrast after pre-treatment with
   sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine. CT head final read negative. CT
   torso final read pending.
   - NG lavage positive with 500cc dark, red fluid not cleared after
   flushing in the afternoon.
   - Hepatology aware and recommended correction of coagulopathy and
   indicated EGD not indicated at this time for oozing.
   - ID recommended broadening antibiotic coverage to include Vancomycin.
   We also added Flagyl. They also recommended RUQ US with dopplers to
   assess for acute clot.
   - Spoke with both [**Doctor First Name 2778**] (patient's sister's husband) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10591**] and
   [**Doctor First Name 142**] (patient's sister) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10512**]. [**Doctor First Name 142**] confirmed that she is
   the healthcare proxy. The seriousness of the patient's disease was
   conveyed including multi-organ failure and poor prognosis. [**Doctor First Name 142**] was
   recently discharged from ICU s/p extubation 3-4 days ago and is
   currently unable to come in to visit until perhaps Friday. Patient is
   currently still full code, although [**Doctor First Name 142**] notes that ""she would not
   want to live like a vegetable"". She would appreciate daily updates and
   make further decision regarding patient's care.
   - Patient received 2 units pRBCs, 4 units FFP, 2 unit platelets
   throughout the course of the day. Another 2 units FFP, 1 unit platelets
   written for at 0200. Goal Hct > 25, INR < 2, Plat > 50.

   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Fungemia: One blood culture. Will Identify type over next 48 hours.
   -          Optho today
   -          Change to Micafungin until speciation.
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Transaminitis improved overnight.
   Bilirubin continues to increase. Indirect bilirubin stable and within
   normal limits. Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in
   the setting of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection. Will
   follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for fluid, although
   likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on PSupport for today. Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   # Blood Per OG Tube: Resolved this AM with correction of patients
   coagulopathy. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). NO EGD indicated for oozing.
   - Appreciate Hepatology Recs.
   - Q8 Hr HCT
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -Tx at less than 25 or if symptomatic
   - Platelets >50, FFP to decrease INR <2
   # Rash
   Improved greatly overnight on IV Vancomycin. Vesicular with PMNs only
   so far. DFA negative. Viral Culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Mental Status: Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and
   Propofol. Pt unresponsive to voice. Does withdrawl to pain.
   - Follow, Minimize sedation/benzos.
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Improved with fluid yesterday and better MAP.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.

   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Overnight LFTs increased drastically.
   Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in the setting of
   acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02
   # Blood Per OG Tube: [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). Question need for EGD to

   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Sepsis, Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Obtained CT head and CT torso with contrast after pre-treatment with
   sodium bicarbonate and acetylcysteine. CT head final read negative. CT
   torso final read pending.
   - NG lavage positive with 500cc dark, red fluid not cleared after
   flushing in the afternoon.
   - Hepatology aware and recommended correction of coagulopathy and
   indicated EGD not indicated at this time for oozing.
   - ID recommended broadening antibiotic coverage to include Vancomycin.
   We also added Flagyl. They also recommended RUQ US with dopplers to
   assess for acute clot.
   - Spoke with both [**Doctor First Name 2778**] (patient's sister's husband) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10591**] and
   [**Doctor First Name 142**] (patient's sister) at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10512**]. [**Doctor First Name 142**] confirmed that she is
   the healthcare proxy. The seriousness of the patient's disease was
   conveyed including multi-organ failure and poor prognosis. [**Doctor First Name 142**] was
   recently discharged from ICU s/p extubation 3-4 days ago and is
   currently unable to come in to visit until perhaps Friday. Patient is
   currently still full code, although [**Doctor First Name 142**] notes that ""she would not
   want to live like a vegetable"". She would appreciate daily updates and
   make further decision regarding patient's care.
   - Patient received 2 units pRBCs, 4 units FFP, 2 unit platelets
   throughout the course of the day. Another 2 units FFP, 1 unit platelets
   written for at 0200. Goal Hct > 25, INR < 2, Plat > 50.
   - A-line replaced.
   - Called by microbiology in early AM - budding yeast growing from
   bottles on [**1-16**]. Fluconazole started.
   - Weaned to pressure support during the evening.

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD.
   - Would consider broadening coverage to include Vancomycin.
   - Continue meropenem (stopped linezolid [**1-13**], stopped
   vanc/levo/cipro/flagyl/PO vanc [**1-12**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Fungemia:
   -          Optho today
   -          Change to Micafungin until speciation.
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Trending up since admission. Overnight LFTs increased drastically.
   Unclear etiology. Most likely related to cholestasis in the setting of
   acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - CT Abdomen with Contrast today.
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily now
   - FU Hepatology Recs.
   # Respiratory Failure, Pleural Effusion
   Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio, bilateral
   infiltrates. Likely related with underlying pneumonia/infection.
   Concern for empyema, less likely hemothorax although under
   consideration given coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to
   estimate need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent autopeep.
   -Treat for CAP with pneumonia
   - Defer thoracentesis at this time
coagulopathy
   - Stay on AC for today, attempt to wean down Fi02
   # Blood Per OG Tube: [**Month (only) 11**] be related to gastritis, stress ulcer, varix
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). Question need for EGD to
   eval etiology of bleed.
   - Appreciate Hepatology Recs.
   - Q6 Hr HCT
   -Guaiac stools
   -PPI IV BID
   -Tx at less than 21 or if symptomatic
   - Platelets >20, FFP to decrease INR
   # Rash
   Vesicular with PMNs only so far. DFA negative. Viral Culture
   preliminary negative.
   - DC Acyclovir
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash
   - Appreciate Derm recs
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaled patient in ED.  Her liver
   synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T.bili elevated as well
   since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   Currently CP score of C. MELD 27. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin WNLs (checked
   given early COPD).
   - F/u hepatology recs.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone, lasix  for now
   # Positive U/A
   E.coli Gram negative, therefore not blood culture organism. Covered by
   meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   multifocal potential zoster (although unlikely) need to retest with
   consent.
   - D/w patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/trauma
   As yet unclear etiology. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).
   Possible neck trauma, unable to assess pain.  Trauma was consulted in
   ED.  Nothing to do for now.
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Call methadone clinic on Monday
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   [**Month (only) 11**] develop ATN, but has been some urine output. If falls off may give
   more fluid gently to evaluate response. No post-ATN diuresis. Should
   check urine microscopy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Adjust meds as needed.
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Bicarb/Mucomyst prior to CT with contrast.
   # Hyponatremia
   Patient on Vasopressin. Improved to 133 now that meds in NS where
   possible instead of D5. Liver failure also likely responsible.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, and possible diabetes, who presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. She has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with increasing respiratory distress, hypotension, and coagulopathy. The patient has a broad range of medical conditions, including pneumonia, sepsis, and liver failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, with decreasing PaO2 and increasing FiO2. This may lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's blood culture is positive for Strep. Pneumo, and the patient is at risk for further septic episodes.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which is a bleeding disorder. This may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and potential cerebral bleeding.
4. Liver Failure: The patient has liver failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and the patient is at risk for further liver damage.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's kidney function is deteriorating, and the patient is at risk for further kidney damage.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is a bleeding disorder. This may lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and potential cerebral bleeding.
7. Opioid Dependence: The patient is opioid-dependent, which is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. The patient's opioid dependence may lead to further complications, including respiratory depression and potential overdose.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's sodium levels are low, and the patient is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Continue to manage the patient's coagulopathy with blood products and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Continue to manage the patient's liver failure with supportive care and consideration of liver transplantation.
5. Continue to manage the patient's kidney injury with fluid management and consideration of dialysis.
6. Continue to manage the patient's pancytopenia with blood products and anticoagulation therapy.
7. Continue to manage the patient's opioid dependence with ongoing opioid therapy and consideration of alternative pain management strategies.
8. Continue to manage the patient's hyponatremia with fluid management and electrolyte replacement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis who is currently in the MICU with septic shock, persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure, and severe hypoxemia. She has a bullous abdominal rash and GPCs growing from the blood. Despite being off pressors, the patient has not made significant clinical progress from a respiratory perspective. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, and has a complex medical history, including cirrhosis, acute renal failure, and GI bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to persist, and she may require ongoing treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications to manage the infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and she may require ongoing mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to manage her hypoxemia.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to persist, and she may require ongoing dialysis to manage her electrolyte imbalance and fluid overload.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is likely to continue to progress, and she may require ongoing treatment with medications such as beta blockers and diuretics to manage her liver function.
5. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed is likely to continue, and she may require ongoing treatment with medications such as proton pump inhibitors and antacids to manage her bleeding.
6. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS): The patient's TSS is likely to persist, and she may require ongoing treatment with antibiotics and other medications to manage her symptoms.
7. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely to persist, and she may require ongoing treatment with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to manage her hypoxemia.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to persist, and she may require ongoing treatment with blood products and medications such as heparin to manage her bleeding.
9. Rash: The patient's rash is likely to continue, and she may require ongoing treatment with medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids to manage her symptoms.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications, and she requires ongoing treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, and other medications to manage her infection, respiratory failure, and other medical conditions."

   examination.  Extensive bibasilar atelectasis and multifocal bilateral
   lung opacities minimally improved since the prior study concerning for
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Abdominal ascites, slightly increased in volume compared to the
   prior study.
   3. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and splenic varices.
   4. Pan colonic wall thickening suggestive of pancolitis. Etiology
   includes infection or inflammatory. However third spacing may cause a
   similar finding.
   5. Bilateral rib fractures including displaced right-sided rib
   fractures.  Unchanged from the prior study. Correlate with possible
   history of CPR.
   6. Total body anasarca.
   - Lasix 60mg IV x 2 -> I/O
   - Double lumen midline placed. Will need to pull midline [**1-22**].

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Will pull central line
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] goal -1L
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 30, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]
   Multi Lumen central line placed [**1-11**]; will need to removed today
   Arterial Line placed [**1-12**]; will need to remove given fungemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Social Work spoke with sister [**Name (NI) 142**]. She is unable to come in - as we
   know. We can plan for conference call on Friday if team thinks this
   would benefit.
   - ID: Micafungin.
   - Hep: Continue lactulose, lasix gtt and albumin for diuresis.
   - Optho: Okay, Will need repeat exam in two weeks.
   - RUQ US with Doppler: Patent with good flow.
   - [**Hospital 10552**] Clinic: 70mg Daily, Daily, Last there [**1-9**]. Changed to
   Methadone IV 15mg IV Q8hrs.
   - HCT: 2 Units pRBCs, 2 FFP
   - CT Torso:
   1. Moderate right pleural effusion, smaller than on the prior
   examination.  Extensive bibasilar atelectasis and multifocal bilateral
   lung opacities minimally improved since the prior study concerning for
   multifocal pneumonia.
   2. Abdominal ascites, slightly increased in volume compared to the
   prior study.
   3. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and splenic varices.
   4. Pan colonic wall thickening suggestive of pancolitis. Etiology
   includes infection or inflammatory. However third spacing may cause a
   similar finding.
   5. Bilateral rib fractures including displaced right-sided rib
   fractures.  Unchanged from the prior study. Correlate with possible
   history of CPR.
   6. Total body anasarca.
   - Lasix 60mg IV x 2 -> I/O
   - Double lumen midline placed. Will need to pull midline [**1-22**].
   Did not pull IJ given low o2 sats and need for propofol overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Will pull central line
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] goal -1L
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 30, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion:
	* ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to bilateral infiltrates and decreased P:F ratio.
	* Respiratory acidosis and primary metabolic alkalosis.
	* Unclear etiology, but likely related to underlying pneumonia/infection.
2. Fungemia:
	* Yeast infection, likely Candida spp., as evidenced by blood cultures.
	* Potential for dissemination to other organs, such as the brain or kidneys.
	* May require antifungal therapy, such as Micafungin.
3. Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia:
	* Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, likely due to cholestasis or liver injury.
	* May require further evaluation and management, such as liver function tests and imaging.
4. Pancytopenia:
	* Low white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts, likely due to underlying liver disease or bone marrow suppression.
	* May require blood product transfusions and bone marrow stimulation.
5. Altered Mental Status:
	* Encephalopathy, potentially due to hypoxia, sepsis, or liver failure.
	* May require further evaluation and management, such as EEG, imaging, and neurology consultation.
6. Abdominal Rash:
	* Vesicular rash, likely due to viral or bacterial infection.
	* May require further evaluation and management, such as cultures and dermatology consultation.
7. Opioid Dependence:
	* Patient is dependent on methadone, which may require ongoing management and monitoring.
8. DM/Hypoglycemia:
	* Patient has a history of hypoglycemic events and elevated insulin and C-peptide levels.
	* May require further evaluation and management, such as insulin therapy and glucose monitoring.
9. Acute Kidney Injury:
	* Patient has acute kidney injury, likely due to sepsis and fluid overload.
	* May require further evaluation and management, such as nephrology consultation and fluid management.

The patient's condition is complex and requires ongoing monitoring and management to address these potential complications. The healthcare team should continue to assess the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status, as well as their liver and kidney function, to ensure that they receive appropriate care and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Discuss on rounds re: pull line
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue Lasix gtt goal -1L
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 50, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OG tube in; currently NPO as
   holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Discuss on rounds re: pull line
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue Lasix gtt goal -1L
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 50, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OG tube in; currently NPO as
   holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Discuss on rounds re: pull line
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue Lasix gtt goal -1L
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 50, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OG tube in; currently NPO as
   holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin, Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Discuss on rounds re: pull line
   .
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Continue Lasix gtt goal -1L
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 50, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Follow up methadone clinic
   - Maintain her on 20 mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, OG tube in; currently NPO as
   holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and the presence of Strep. Pneumo in the blood and yeast in the blood culture suggests that the patient may be at risk for further septic episodes.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which is likely related to the underlying lung disease and the presence of bilateral lung opacities. The patient's respiratory acidosis and decreased P:F ratio suggest that the patient may be at risk for further respiratory compromise.
3. ARDS: The patient's bilateral infiltrates and decreased P:F ratio suggest that the patient may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Fungemia: The patient has fungemia, which is likely related to the presence of yeast in the blood culture. The patient's fungemia may be a sign of a more widespread fungal infection.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is likely related to the underlying liver disease and the presence of yeast in the blood culture.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, which is likely related to the underlying liver disease and the presence of yeast in the blood culture.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension and increasing intracranial pressure suggest that the patient may be at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome.
8. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely related to the underlying liver disease and the presence of yeast in the blood culture.
9. Opioid dependence: The patient has a history of opioid dependence, and the use of methadone to manage pain may exacerbate this condition.
10. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely related to the underlying liver disease and the presence of yeast in the blood culture.

In terms of the patient's overall condition, the patient is at high risk for further complications and may require ongoing intensive care and monitoring. The patient's liver function is impaired, and the presence of yeast in the blood culture suggests that the patient may have a more widespread fungal infection. The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, and the patient may require ongoing mechanical ventilation to support respiration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's imaging studies, including a CT Torso, reveal:

* Moderate right pleural effusion
* Abdominal ascites
* Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and splenic varices
* Pan colonic wall thickening suggestive of pancolitis
* Bilateral rib fractures
* Total body anasarca

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including:

* Propofol
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Methadone Hydrochloride
* Micafungin

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Endotracheal tube
* Ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow
* Vt (Set): 400 mL
* Vt (Spontaneous): 518 mL
* PS: 12 cmH2O
* RR (Set): 25
* RR (Spontaneous): 0
* PEEP: 15 cmH2O
* FiO2: 80%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Intubated and sedated
* Sclera icteric
* Intubated and dried blood on lips
* Obese with distended and moderately tense abdomen
* Diminished bowel sounds
* Rash on LLQ and diffuse petechial rash on chest
* Nectrotic region on left breast and enlarged bullae
* Vesicles on stomach resolving
* Chronic venous stasis changes on lower extremities

The patient's neurologic examination is limited due to sedation, but the pupils are reactive.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's low white blood cell count and elevated lactate level
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's bilateral lung opacities and need for mechanical ventilation
* Hepatic failure due to the patient's cirrhosis and elevated liver enzymes
* Renal failure due to the patient's low albumin level and elevated creatinine level
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's pancolitis and portal hypertension
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to the patient's immobility and risk factors
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of Candida in the blood culture

Based on the patient's complex medical condition and laboratory results, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies to prevent potential complications and optimize treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU with septic shock, persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia, and a bullous abdominal rash. She has been improving hemodynamically but continues to have severe hypoxemia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors, and is receiving mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis may worsen, leading to further liver dysfunction, ascites, and encephalopathy.
5. Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS): The patient's TSS may lead to further organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
7. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
8. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to delirium, agitation, and increased risk of falls and injury.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her septic shock, respiratory failure, and cirrhosis. The patient's antibiotic and antifungal therapy should be continued and adjusted as necessary. Further evaluation and management of her coagulopathy, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and altered mental status are also necessary."

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode this AM with approximately 500cc BRBPR. Likely related with
   coagulopathy with component of variceal bleed.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - GI/hepatology consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] consider drip
   - Octreotide consider drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider lasix when BPs stable
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes. Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode this AM with approximately 500cc BRBPR. Likely related with
   coagulopathy with component of variceal bleed.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - GI/hepatology consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] consider drip
   - Octreotide consider drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Consider lasix when BPs stable
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes. Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   - Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]

The patient has a significant number of medical issues, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae and is receiving antibiotics.
3. Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast and is receiving antifungal medication.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient has a history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which may be related to her cirrhosis or other underlying conditions.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has a altered mental status and is receiving sedation and analgesia.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may be related to her liver disease or other underlying conditions.
7. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level.
8. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a history of acute kidney injury and is receiving fluids and medications to support kidney function.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemic events and is receiving insulin and other medications to manage her blood sugar levels.

The patient's current medical condition is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from her current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop further respiratory failure, which could lead to the need for more aggressive ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient may develop further sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Fungemia: The patient may develop further fungemia, which could lead to the need for more aggressive antifungal therapy or even surgery.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient may develop abdominal compartment syndrome, which could lead to organ failure and death.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may develop hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to altered mental status and even coma.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient may develop further acute kidney injury, which could lead to the need for dialysis or even kidney transplantation.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient may develop further hypoglycemic events, which could lead to brain damage or even death.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical issues that require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from her current condition are significant, and she requires careful management and monitoring to prevent these complications."

   [**2141-1-16**]  BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING
   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] goal -1L
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 30, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes. Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   - Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]
   - Arterial Line placed [**1-12**]; will need to remove given fungemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, ? DM, depression who presents
   with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, possible melena 1 week ago,
   breast pain and a rash, broken ribs. Respiratory failure and sepsis
   primary issues at present.
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. Repeat blood
   cultures from [**1-16**] NGTD of Strep. Pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently on
   norepi and vasopressin), CVP > 12, UO>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will Identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. Episodes of desaturation to high 80s
   overnight. Unclear etiology; CXR unremarkable. Likely secondary to
   volume overload (+16L length of stay) associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely related with underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will defer thoracentesis at this time given
   coagulopathy. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate need for
   fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] goal -1L
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Blood Per OG Tube
   Resolving. Likely related with gastritis, stress ulcer, varices
   (previous varices banded in [**2139-6-23**]). No EGD indicated per
   hepatology given oozing and will correct primary coagulopathy.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - q8 hour Hct
   - Guaiac stools
   - PPI IV BID
   - Goal platelets > 30, INR < 2, Hct > 25
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone and Propofol. Patient
   unresponsive to voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic
   component or if related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given
   poor liver function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic
   encephalopathy. Given fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or
   other causes. Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG tube in;
   currently NPO as holding tube feeds for high residuals
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots when able; No prophylaxis at this time given
   elevated INR and also ongoing coagulopathy
   # Access:
   - Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-21**]
   - Arterial Line placed [**1-12**]; will need to remove given fungemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and severe hypoxemia. The patient has a bullous abdominal rash and GPCs growing from the blood.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.9°C (102°F)
* Heart rate: 116 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 143/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 32 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 26 μmol/L
* Lactic acid: 3.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 861 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 3.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock/S. pneumonia bacteremia/fungemia
* Respiratory failure with severe hypoxemia
* GI bleed/blood loss anemia
* Acute renal failure
* Cirrhosis
* Altered mental status
* Impaired skin integrity
* Pain control
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder
* Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuous vancomycin for S. pneumonia bacteremia
* Continuous micafungin for fungemia
* Packed red blood cells and IV fluids for blood loss anemia
* Fresh frozen plasma and platelets for coagulopathy
* Hepatology team aware of patient's condition
* Restarting lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy
* Ongoing respiratory support with high FIO2
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory status
* Development of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Progression of septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Worsening of cirrhosis and liver failure
* Development of multi-organ failure
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Potential for TSS or ARDS to worsen

The patient's current condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   today to do an EGD where they found bleeding esophageal and gastric
   varices.  Esophageal varices were banded and gastric varix treated with
   glue with at least temporary hemostasis.  Her blood pressure has
   remained stable though her HR has been 100-120.  We have transfused
   pRBCs, FFP, platelets.  New RIJ central placed this evening.
   Meanwhile, her O2 requirement has increased to 1.0, PEEP 18 as she has
   been transfused additional blood products.
   We had a family meeting today with the patient
s sister and
   brother-in-law, who are her closest family memebers.  Discussed with
   her that she now has multiorgan failure superimposed on her worsening
   liver function and rising bilirubin.  Her prognosis is poor at this
   point, particularly if she rebleeds.  Her code status was changed to
   DNR/DNI.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   varices.  Esophageal varices were banded and gastric varix treated with
   glue with at least temporary hemostasis.  Her blood pressure has
   remained stable though her HR has been 100-120.  We have transfused
   pRBCs, FFP, platelets.  New RIJ central placed this evening.
   Meanwhile, her O2 requirement has increased to 1.0, PEEP 18 as she has
   been transfused additional blood products.
   We had a family meeting today with the patient
s sister and
   brother-in-law, who are her closest family memebers.  Discussed with
   her that she now has multiorgan failure superimposed on her worsening
   liver function and rising bilirubin.  Her prognosis is poor at this
   point, particularly if she rebleeds.  Her code status was changed to
   DNR/DNI.
   Pt is critically ill.  Time spent 60 minutes.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with Child's C cirrhosis in the MICU with septic shock, persistently elevated lactate, respiratory failure, and severe hypoxemia. She has a bullous abdominal rash and GPCs growing from the blood.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Septic shock/S. pneumo bacteremia/fungemia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin, micafungin, and flagyl.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has ongoing bilateral pneumonia and bibasilar collapse, and is on a high FIO2.
3. GI bleed/Blood loss anemia: The patient has received pRBCs, IVF, and FFP, and platelets are being transfused.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is decreasing.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's bilirubin level is increasing, and she has developed esophageal and gastric varices.
6. Altered mental status: The patient is unable to follow simple commands and responds only to painful stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
* Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* GI bleeding, including rebleeding and further blood loss anemia.
* Acute kidney injury, including worsening renal failure and potential need for dialysis.
* Cirrhosis-related complications, including worsening liver function, portal hypertension, and potential bleeding from esophageal and gastric varices.
* Altered mental status, including worsening encephalopathy and potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and her prognosis is poor at this point, particularly if she rebleeds."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, depression who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain and a rash,
   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations regarding TIPS and outcomes
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn; likely hold given hypernatremia
   # Goals of Care
   Need to continue discussion with family regarding goals of care.
   Patient currently intubated x 10 days. Will need to discuss PEG, trach
   as potential next steps.
   - Family meeting
   # Hypernatremia
   Likely secondary to ongoing fluid shifts, component of renal failure.
   - Replete free water, D5W
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG
   tube/currently NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots; elevated INR
   # Access:
   - Double Lumen midline placed [**1-18**]; will need to be removed [**1-22**]
   - Arterial Line placed [**1-12**]; changed over wire on [**1-20**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations regarding TIPS and outcomes
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn; likely hold given hypernatremia
   # Goals of Care
   Need to continue discussion with family regarding goals of care.
   Patient currently intubated x 10 days. Will need to discuss PEG, trach
   as potential next steps.
   - Family meeting
   # Hypernatremia
   Likely secondary to ongoing fluid shifts, component of renal failure.
   - Replete free water, D5W
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG
   tube/currently NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots; elevated INR
   # Access:

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, depression, and a history of Hepatitis C. She presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain, and a rash. She has developed respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for 10 days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with fungemia, sepsis, and respiratory failure, and is at risk for further complications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Re-bleeding:** The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has undergone variceal banding. There is a high likelihood of re-bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient has sepsis and is at risk for further complications, including organ failure and death.
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient has respiratory failure and is at risk for further complications, including pneumonia, ARDS, and death.
4. **DIC:** The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and is at risk for further complications, including bleeding and organ failure.
5. **Hepatic Failure:** The patient has hepatic failure and is at risk for further complications, including encephalopathy, ascites, and death.
6. **Infections:** The patient has fungemia and sepsis, and is at risk for further infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
7. **Renal Failure:** The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk for further complications, including chronic kidney disease and death.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism:** The patient has a high risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and respiratory failure.
9. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has a history of COPD and is at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
10. **Mental Status Changes:** The patient has altered mental status and is at risk for further complications, including encephalopathy and death.

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient's care team should continue to monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly. The patient's family should be educated on her condition and treatment plan, and a code status of DNR/DNI should be respected. The patient's social work consult should be completed to address her mental health and social support needs. The patient's pain should be managed, and she should be provided with adequate nutrition and hydration. The patient's lines and tubes should be monitored and managed according to protocol. The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued, and she should be monitored for signs of infection. The patient's liver function should be monitored, and she should be treated for any signs of liver failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, depression who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain and a rash,
   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, depression who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain and a rash,
   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until speciation
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG
   tube/currently NPO
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots; elevated INR

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old female with cirrhosis, COPD, depression, and a history of Hepatitis C. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain, and a rash. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure, and altered mental status. She has had multiple episodes of bleeding, including a 2.5L blood per rectum episode yesterday, which required endoscopy and variceal banding. She has also had fungemia, and her blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and ongoing coagulopathy/DIC increases her risk of rebleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has had multiple episodes of bleeding, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and she may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be related to her liver dysfunction, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Fungal Infections: The patient's fungemia increases her risk of developing further fungal infections, such as pneumonia or meningitis.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may worsen, and she may require further evaluation and treatment to address this issue.
7. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension and elevated bilirubin levels increase her risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome.
8. Opioid Dependence: The patient's history of opioid dependence may contribute to her altered mental status and may require further evaluation and treatment.
9. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's ongoing fluid resuscitation and potential for further bleeding may increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury.
10. FEN: The patient's IVF prn and replete electrolytes may be necessary to address her fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure, and altered mental status. Her bleeding has been stabilized, but she requires ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent further bleeding. She also requires further evaluation and treatment for her fungemia, pancytopenia, and potential abdominal compartment syndrome. Her opioid dependence and history of Hepatitis C require ongoing management and treatment. Her acute kidney injury and potential for further bleeding require close monitoring and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock and bacteremia/fungemia
* Respiratory failure with ongoing bilateral pneumonia
* GI bleed and blood loss anemia
* Cirrhosis with worsening liver function
* Coagulopathy with DIC and synthetic issues
* Altered mental status potentially related to hepatic encephalopathy

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and antifungals for septic shock and bacteremia/fungemia
* Ongoing management of respiratory failure with high FIO2
* Transfusion of blood products to support bleeding
* Close monitoring of liver function and potential need for TIPS intervention
* Discussion of goals of care with family
* Restart of lactulose for potential hepatic encephalopathy
* Monitoring for and management of potential complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and optimize outcomes."

   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   Impression: Liver failure complicated by coma, coagulopathy and gastric
   varices that are now bleeding. Prognosis very poor. Will meet with
   family today to discuss goals of care.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations regarding TIPS and outcomes
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until sensitivities.
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn; likely hold given hypernatremia
   # Goals of Care
   Need to continue discussion with family regarding goals of care.
   Patient currently intubated x 10 days. Will need to discuss PEG, trach
   as potential next steps.
   - Family meeting
   # Hypernatremia
   Likely secondary to ongoing fluid shifts, component of renal failure.
   - Replete free water, D5W
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   40 yo F with cirrhosis [**1-24**] hep C, COPD, depression who presents with
   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, melena, breast pain and a rash,
   broken ribs. Respiratory failure, DIC, sepsis, hepatic failure and
   altered mental status primary issues at present.
   Impression: Liver failure complicated by coma, coagulopathy and gastric
   varices that are now bleeding. Prognosis very poor. Will meet with
   family today to discuss goals of care.
   # GIB/BRBPR
   Episode yesterday with approximately 2.5L blood per rectum total. S/p
   EGD GI intervention with variceal banding and Dermabond. High
   likelihood of rebleed. Complicated by ongoing coagulopathy/DIC.
   - Maintain access
   - IVF bolus, albumin, pRBCs, FFP, platelets goal Hct > 25, INR < 2,
   platelets > 30
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations; continue to follow their
   recommendations regarding TIPS and outcomes
   - IV PPI drip
   - Octreotide drip
   - q6 hour Hct, INR, platelets
   # Fungemia
   Two sets of blood cultures from [**1-16**] positive for yeast. Will identify
   type over next 48 hours. Negative ophtho evaluation on [**1-18**]. Will need
   repeat eye exam in 2 weeks from that date. Central line removed
   [**2141-1-19**] given fungemia.
   - Continue Micafungin until sensitivities.
   - Trend blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Sepsis/Strep Pneumo Bacteremia
   Strep. Pneumo in blood. Consistent with all cultures. No growth to date
   of multiple blood cultures since that time of Strep pneumo.
   - Continue Vancomycin (renally dosed), Flagyl and Meropenem (stopped
   Linezolid [**1-13**])
   - Early goal directed care; MAP > 65 with pressors prn (currently not
   on pressors), CVP > 12, UOP>30cc
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Trend blood cultures
   # Respiratory Failure/Pleural Effusion
   ABG indicates primary metabolic alkalosis which is compensated;
   concomitant respiratory acidosis. CXR unremarkable consistent with
   volume overload (+16L length of stay), likely associated with DIC
   resuscitation. Meets criteria for ARDS given decreased P: F ratio,
   bilateral infiltrates. Likely component of underlying
   pneumonia/infection. Will follow pressure, I&Os and UOP to estimate
   need for fluid, although likely significant insensible losses.
   - Continue CMV assist
   - Continue ARDSnet protocol ventilation with low tidal volume and low
   rate ventilation given fairly large empyema/ascites; brought down tidal
   volume and rate; increased FiO2. Given incomplete expiration (COPD
   contributing) reduce rate and possibly minute ventilation slightly to
   prevent auto PEEP
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Lasix 20-40mg prn; likely hold given hypernatremia
   # Goals of Care
   Need to continue discussion with family regarding goals of care.
   Patient currently intubated x 10 days. Will need to discuss PEG, trach
   as potential next steps.
   - Family meeting
   # Hypernatremia
   Likely secondary to ongoing fluid shifts, component of renal failure.
   - Replete free water, D5W
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT without acute process. On Methadone. Patient unresponsive to
   voice but does withdrawal to pain. Uncertain if hypoxic component or if
   related to poor elimination of sedation/benzos given poor liver
   function. Ammonia not elevated; unlikely hepatic encephalopathy. Given
   fungemia, considering cryptococcal meningitis or other causes although
   less likely as Cryptococcal serology negative.
   - Continue to follow
   - Minimize sedation/benzos
   - Continue lactulose
   # Transaminitis/Hyperbilirubinemia
   Stable/downtrending at this time although bilirubin continues to rise.
   Unclear etiology, but most likely related to cholestasis in the setting
   of acute illness.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Monitor vesicular pressure daily for previous concern re: abdominal
   compartment syndrome
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Abdominal Rash
   Has continued to improve on therapy. Vesicular with PMNs only so far.
   DFA negative. Viral culture preliminary negative.
   - Continue to follow cultures
   - Re-culture rash if worse
   - Continue to follow dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Cirrhosis
   Secondary to Hep C, possible also made worse by EtOH.  Followed by
   liver clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Hepatology evaluated patient in ED.  Her
   liver synthetic function is decreased based on INR.  T bili elevated as
   well since admission.  [**Month (only) 11**] be decompensation of already poor liver.
   MELD 29 today. Alpha-1-anti-trypsin within normal limits (checked given
   early COPD).
   - Continue to follow hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue lactulose
   - Hold nadalol, spironolactone at this time
   # Positive UA
   E.coli negative in blood cultures. Covered by meropenem
   # Pancytopenia
   Counts are stably low.  Likely related to hep C.  Patient reports being
   HIV negative multiple time in OMR but no HIV documented.  Given
   fungemia, will need to test with consent.
   - Discuss with patient HIV test when possible
   # Rib Fractures/Trauma
   Etiology unclear. Ecchymoses on exam (shoulder and back).  Possible
   neck trauma, unable to assess pain. Trauma was consulted in ED.
   Possible history of abuse. Nothing to do for now.
   - Pain control with fentanyl
   - Social work consult when awake
   - Obtain further history when able
   # Opioid dependence
   Continue methadone at last known dose (called [**Hospital 10552**] clinic but
   no-one on call today ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10559**]).
   - Maintain her on 15mg q8h IV (on 70 mg PO QD according to last
   discharge summary)
   # DM/Hypoglycmia
   Blood glucose normal. Hypoglycemic events and past elevated insulin and
   C-peptide, although not strikingly high. Patients Hb A1c was 5.
   Consider insulinoma and other DDx.
   -ISS (for dextrose also)
 glucagon less likely to be helpful.
   # Acute Kidney Injury
   Continues to improve with fluid.  Received and should continue to
   receive pre/post-treatment with bicarb/Mucomyst if CT with contrast.
   - Trend Cr
   - Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose medications
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, replete free water; OG

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and is currently experiencing bleeding. This can lead to hemorrhagic shock, acid-base disturbances, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Strep. pneumoniae and Candida albicans, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR and is at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and other bleeding events.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for liver failure, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of bleeding complications.
6. Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
8. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and is at risk for secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections.
9. Fungal Infection: The patient has a positive fungal culture and is at risk for disseminated fungal infections, including candidemia and cryptococcal meningitis.
10. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemia and is at risk for recurrent episodes, which can lead to neurological damage, seizures, and coma.

To mitigate these complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying conditions, including:

* Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and radiological studies
* Aggressive management of sepsis and coagulopathy
* Optimal management of respiratory failure and ARDS
* Close monitoring of liver function and coagulation studies
* Aggressive management of kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances
* Prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal therapy
* Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and management of hypoglycemia
* Close communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure optimal care and management of her complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 40-year-old individual with a chief complaint of variceal bleed and sepsis. They are currently in the ICU, intubated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and their condition has progressed to septic shock, persistent gastric variceal bleed, and respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.2°F)
* Heart rate: 65 bpm
* Blood pressure: 111/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* Central venous pressure: 11 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 45 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 38 mEq/L
* Sodium: 154 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Glucose: 298 mg/dL
* Liver enzymes: Elevated
* Coagulation studies: INR 2.7, PTT 36.7 seconds
* Blood cultures: Positive for S. pneumo bacteremia and fungemia

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock
* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* GI bleed/Blood loss anemia
* Coagulopathy
* Cirrhosis
* Altered mental status
* Metabolic alkalosis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, and blood products
* Correction of coagulopathy with FFP and platelets
* Hepatology follow-up
* Possible TIPS intervention for gastric varices
* Discussion of goals of care with family
* Restart of lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further bleeding from gastric varices
* Development of multi-organ failure
* Progression of sepsis and septic shock
* Respiratory failure and need for increased ventilator support
* Coagulopathy and bleeding complications
* Hepatic encephalopathy and altered mental status
* Metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, sepsis, respiratory failure, DIC, and a persistent gastric variceal bleed. The patient has undergone banding and dermabond procedures, but continues to actively bleed and require significant blood product support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's ongoing blood loss and requirement for blood products increase the risk of hemorrhagic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's DIC and INR elevation refractory to correction increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
3. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and fungemia require ongoing antimicrobial therapy, and the risk of septic shock and multi-organ failure is high.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and pneumonia require ongoing ventilatory support, and the risk of respiratory failure and need for ECMO is high.
5. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and ongoing bleeding increase the risk of liver failure and the need for liver transplantation.
6. Renal failure: The patient's ongoing blood loss and requirement for blood products increase the risk of renal failure and the need for dialysis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's ongoing blood loss and requirement for blood products increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia.
8. Opioid dependence: The patient's ongoing opioid therapy increases the risk of opioid dependence and withdrawal syndrome.
9. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's ongoing bicarbonate therapy increases the risk of metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's ongoing fluid repletion increases the risk of hypernatremia, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.
11. Rib fractures: The patient's unknown etiology of rib fractures increases the risk of respiratory compromise and the need for further evaluation and management.
12. Trauma: The patient's unknown etiology of trauma increases the risk of ongoing bleeding and the need for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current treatment plan includes ongoing blood product support, antimicrobial therapy, ventilatory support, and fluid repletion. The patient's family needs to be informed of the patient's poor prognosis and the need for ongoing supportive care. The patient's goals of care should be discussed with the family, and potential next steps, such as PEG and tracheostomy, should be considered."
