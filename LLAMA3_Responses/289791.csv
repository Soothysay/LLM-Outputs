   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # HYPOTENSION
   - Consider midodrine?
   # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Consider eval for hypercoaguable states, ? malignancy
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   # Dyspnea: pt w/ baseline SOB, on O2 at home, unknown amount. Now w/
   increasing SOB, possibly [**2-7**] to PE, but differential includes CHF, MI,
   PNA, COPD exacerbation, restrictive ascites.
   - Pt satting well, breathing comfortably, continue to monitor
   - check BNP
   - consider ECHO for signs of R-heart failure, ? secondary to PE
   - home meds for COPD/ASTHMA
   - pt w/ HTN, on lasix, w/o hx of known CHF, eval for diastolic heart
   failure w/ECHO as above; continue home dose for now and consider
   diuresis pending further work-up
   - cycle CEs and repeat EKG
   # Diarrhea/Vomiting/Jaundice: diarrhea w/o abd pain, fever, chills,
   less likely to be infection though could still be c-diff, viral gastro,
   or other. Jaundice, elevated ALKP, suggest obstructive process, but US
   showed no biliary dilation. AST/ALT ration also fits acute alcoholic
   hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture.
   -check c-diff
   -f/u final read of u/s
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - consider ERCP or HIDA scan
   - consider ABX if develops fevers, or new info from CTs.
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   # Tachycardia: has afib at baseline, though not sure when he is in or
   out of it. Most likely fast rate from missing his home doses of
   medications. Sepsis/Pain could worsen tachycardia,but pt is
   comfortable, no pain, no fever, no leukocytosis.
   - restart home meds (Dilt, Sotalol)
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # HTN - Well controlled on home meds. Will continue home meds, and
   either treat nausea for POs or adjust to IV as needed for appropriate
   BP control.
   # Code status - DNR/DNI per patient records, needs to be confirmed w/
   patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and jaundice.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 79 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 83/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 89%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a patent portal vein on ultrasound, and his coagulation status is therapeutic on coumadin. He is receiving anticoagulation therapy, but his international normalized ratio (INR) is 3.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 202 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* LDH: 312 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of right-sided colitis, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal. He is also experiencing diarrhea, vomiting, and jaundice.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: Consider midodrine therapy
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): No specific therapy as the patient is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic range on coumadin
* Dyspnea: Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and consider an echocardiogram for signs of right-heart failure
* Diarrhea/Vomiting/Jaundice: Check for Clostridioides difficile (C-diff) and consider an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan
* Tachycardia: Restart the patient's home medications and reassess tomorrow
* COPD/Asthma: Continue home medications
* HTN: Continue home medications and adjust as needed for appropriate blood pressure control
* Code status: Confirm with the patient

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac failure
* Hepatic failure
* Pancreaticitis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pneumonia
* Pleural effusion
* Respiratory acidosis
* Hypercapnia
* Hypoxemia
* Hypotension
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Liver dysfunction
* Kidney dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalance

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output
 borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - Sepsis remains a likely cause of hypotension, especially given GPC in
   clusters on blood culture.  Will follow speciation
   - Vanco 1gm q12.
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Intra-abdominal pressure, lactate
   - if studies c/w HRS, would start octreotide, midodrine, 25% albumin
   tx.
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # FEN/GI:  Lytes PRN,  Will replete albumin as above.
   # PPX: therapeutic INR, diarrhea
   # Code status - DNR/DNI per patient records, needs to be confirmed w/
   patient
   # Dispo: MICU pending stabilization

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath, and found to have pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with right-sided colitis. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, low urine output, and rising creatinine and blood pressures that are poorly responsive to intravenous fluids.

The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, which is likely the cause of his hypotension, given the presence of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters on blood culture. The patient is also at risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome due to his rising creatinine and blood pressures.

The patient's diarrhea and jaundice are likely related to his underlying liver disease, and further workup is needed to determine the cause of his liver dysfunction.

The patient's PE is likely worsening his respiratory status, but it is unlikely to have formed new clots given his therapeutic INR.

The patient's dyspnea is likely related to his chronic COPD, and he is being treated with nebulizers as needed.

The patient's tachycardia is stable, and he is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which needs to be confirmed with the patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's rising creatinine and blood pressures are poorly responsive to intravenous fluids, which increases the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and PE increase the risk of developing respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and atrial fibrillation increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Liver failure: The patient's underlying liver disease and worsening liver function tests increase the risk of developing liver failure.
6. GI bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and jaundice increase the risk of developing GI bleeding.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE increases the risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
8. DVT: The patient's PE increases the risk of developing DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output
 borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - Sepsis remains a likely cause of hypotension, especially given GPC in
   clusters on blood culture.  Will follow speciation
   - Vanco 1gm q12.
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Intra-abdominal pressure, lactate
   - if studies c/w HRS, would start octreotide, midodrine, 25% albumin
   tx.
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mosly due to chronic COPD
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia: has afib at baseline, though not sure when he is in or
   out of it. Most likely fast rate from missing his home doses of
   medications. Sepsis/Pain could worsen tachycardia,but pt is
   comfortable, no pain, no fever, no leukocytosis.
   - restart home meds (Dilt, Sotalol)
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # HTN - Well controlled on home meds. Will continue home meds, and
   either treat nausea for POs or adjust to IV as needed for appropriate
   BP control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Imaging: LENI: No DVT in either lower extremity.
   ECHO: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with
   preserved systolic function. Probable right ventricular dilation with
   borderline normal function.
   Micro: GPC in clusters
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output
 borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - Sepsis remains a likely cause of hypotension, especially given GPC in
   clusters on blood culture.  Will follow speciation
   - Vanco 1gm q12.
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Intra-abdominal pressure, lactate
   - if studies c/w HRS, would start octreotide, midodrine, 25% albumin
   tx.
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mosly due to chronic COPD
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia: has afib at baseline, though not sure when he is in or
   out of it. Most likely fast rate from missing his home doses of
   medications. Sepsis/Pain could worsen tachycardia,but pt is
   comfortable, no pain, no fever, no leukocytosis.
   - restart home meds (Dilt, Sotalol)
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # HTN - Well controlled on home meds. Will continue home meds, and
   either treat nausea for POs or adjust to IV as needed for appropriate
   BP control.
   # Code status - DNR/DNI per patient records, needs to be confirmed w/

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath (SOB), jaundice, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 83/44 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 89% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, mild injected sclera, and sublingual jaundice. His lungs are clear, with mild wheezing anteriorly. His abdomen is distended, with vericosities and tender RUQ.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including AST and ALT, with a slight elevation in bilirubin. The patient's blood cultures are positive for GPC in clusters, suggesting sepsis.

The patient's condition is complicated by the following:

1. Hypotension/Low urine output: The patient's blood pressure is low, and his urine output is decreased. This may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or borderline hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Diarrhea/Jaundice: The patient's diarrhea and jaundice may be related to acute alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's CT-PA and CXR show no evidence of new PE, but the lung findings could represent septic emboli.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to atrial fibrillation, sepsis, or pain.
5. COPD/Asthma: The patient's worsening SOB may be due to his underlying COPD and asthma.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood cultures and elevated liver enzymes suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Borderline Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's low urine output and elevated liver enzymes may indicate borderline HRS, which can progress to fulminant HRS if not treated.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening SOB and lung findings may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea and jaundice may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Antibiotics: Vancomycin 1gm q12 to treat sepsis.
2. Fluid Management: IV fluids to treat hypotension and low urine output.
3. Liver Function Tests: Repeat liver function tests to monitor liver function and rule out cirrhosis.
4. Pulmonary Support: Continue nebulizers PRN to manage COPD and asthma.
5. Cardiac Management: Restart home medications (Dilt, Sotalol) to manage atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.
6. Nutrition: Continue IV nutrition to support the patient's nutritional needs.
7. Code Status: Confirm the patient's code status with him and his family."

   1. Interval development of moderate-to-large abdominal ascites.
   2. Tiny filling defect in the subsegmental branches of the posterior
   segment of the left lower lobe, compatible with acute PE.
   3. Left greater than right basal patchy opacities, as well as bronchial
   wall thickening and minimal post-inflammatory, bronchiectasis,
   persistent in changes since the prior study, mean reflect recurrent
   aspiration, infectious causes are also in the differential.
   4. Fatty liver. Limited evaluation for focal liver lesions.
   Questionable focus of increased attenuation in the posterior right
   lower lobe, as there is clinical concern; MRI with gadolinium could be
   performed.
   5. 13 mm nodular density in the lingula, 3 months follow up is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension
  Sepsis remains a possible cause of hypotension,
   however coag-neg staph in blood culture is likely contaminant.
   Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs are a possible source of infection.
   Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.  Cortisol
   appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Repeat Chest CT.  Sputum culture.  Would treat evidence of PNA with
   Unasyn and Vanc.
   - Stop Vanco 1gm for now as no evidence/source of infection
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Stop octreotide but continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - Will discuss further liver w/u with GI
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.  Holding coumadin now
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   aspiration, infectious causes are also in the differential.
   4. Fatty liver. Limited evaluation for focal liver lesions.
   Questionable focus of increased attenuation in the posterior right
   lower lobe, as there is clinical concern; MRI with gadolinium could be
   performed.
   5. 13 mm nodular density in the lingula, 3 months follow up is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension
  Sepsis remains a possible cause of hypotension,
   however coag-neg staph in blood culture is likely contaminant.
   Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs are a possible source of infection.
   Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.  Cortisol
   appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Repeat Chest CT.  Sputum culture.  Would treat evidence of PNA with
   Unasyn and Vanc.
   - Stop Vanco 1gm for now as no evidence/source of infection
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Stop octreotide but continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - Will discuss further liver w/u with GI
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.  Holding coumadin now
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath, jaundice, and diarrhea. He has a blood culture positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. The patient has developed hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and pulmonary embolism (PE). He is also experiencing liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate levels suggest that sepsis may be a contributing factor. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of the infection.
2. ARF: The patient's rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts on urine sediment are consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely caused by hypotension and borderline hepatorenal syndrome.
3. PE: The patient's CT scan shows a tiny filling defect in the subsegmental branches of the posterior segment of the left lower lobe, which is compatible with acute PE. Further investigation is needed to determine the extent of the PE and to rule out septic emboli.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest liver dysfunction, which may be related to the patient's underlying liver disease or a complication of his sepsis.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be related to his underlying liver disease or a complication of his sepsis.
6. Jaundice: The patient's jaundice may be related to his liver dysfunction or a complication of his sepsis.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat chest CT to further evaluate the extent of the PE and to rule out septic emboli.
2. Perform a sputum culture to determine the presence of pneumonia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and kidney function, and adjust his fluid management and medication regimen as necessary.
4. Consider further investigation into the patient's liver dysfunction, including liver biopsy or MRI with gadolinium.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
6. Consider further investigation into the patient's diarrhea, including stool culture or biopsy.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's jaundice, including liver function tests and bilirubin levels."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   1. Interval development of moderate-to-large abdominal ascites.
   2. Tiny filling defect in the subsegmental branches of the posterior
   segment of the left lower lobe, compatible with acute PE.
   3. Left greater than right basal patchy opacities, as well as bronchial
   wall thickening and minimal post-inflammatory, bronchiectasis,
   persistent in changes since the prior study, mean reflect recurrent
   aspiration, infectious causes are also in the differential.
   4. Fatty liver. Limited evaluation for focal liver lesions.
   Questionable focus of increased attenuation in the posterior right
   lower lobe, as there is clinical concern; MRI with gadolinium could be
   performed.
   5. 13 mm nodular density in the lingula, 3 months follow up is
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output
 borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - Sepsis remains a likely cause of hypotension, especially given GPC in
   clusters on blood culture.  Will follow speciation
   - Vanco 1gm q12.
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Intra-abdominal pressure, lactate
   - if studies c/w HRS, would start octreotide, midodrine, 25% albumin
   tx.
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, jaundice, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/65 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient has a history of sepsis, with a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus. He is receiving vancomycin and has been treated with midodrine and octreotide for hypertension and liver dysfunction.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 124 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 41 IU/L. His bilirubin level is elevated, and his albumin level is low.

The patient has a history of chronic COPD and has been experiencing worsening shortness of breath, which is likely related to his underlying condition. He has also been experiencing diarrhea, which is likely related to his liver dysfunction.

The patient has a small amount of wheezing on examination, but is not in any distress. His cardiac examination is normal, and his neurological examination is also normal.

The patient's radiology studies show evidence of moderate-to-large abdominal ascites, as well as a tiny filling defect in the subsegmental branches of the posterior segment of the left lower lobe, which is compatible with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has a small nodular density in the lingula, which is of uncertain significance.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with an elevated AST and ALT, as well as an elevated bilirubin level. His albumin level is low, and his lactate level is elevated.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and his laboratory results show evidence of ongoing inflammation. He is at risk for developing sepsis-related complications, such as organ dysfunction and death.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and his bilirubin level is elevated. He is at risk for developing liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and his radiology studies show evidence of acute PE. He is at risk for developing further PEs, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of diarrhea, and his laboratory results show evidence of ongoing inflammation. He is at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk for developing hypotension-related complications, such as organ dysfunction and death.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for developing several medical complications, including sepsis, liver failure, pulmonary embolism, diarrhea, and hypotension. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypoxia
 Currently with normal saturation on room air.  Effusion on
   CT suggestive of volume overload.
   - Currently no evidence of pneumonia.  Hold on antibiotics
   - goal to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess IVF (goal even to
   slightly negative)
   - would not tap as unlikely to be infected
   # Possible UTI: 39 WBC on sediment, but likely related ATN.  Culture
   negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence of UTI on exam.
   - D/C macrobid
   - follow cultures
   # Hypotension
  Likely a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and
   decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction.  Sepsis remains a
   possible cause of hypotension, however coag-neg staph in blood culture
   is likely contaminant.  Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs generally
   clear by CT.  Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.
   Cortisol appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - follow lactate
   - IV thiamine
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - further workup per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  Clots not significiant enough to
   explain hypotension.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings could also
   represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - Outpatient follow up for suspicious lung lesion on CT
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   1. Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar
   alveolar opacities, mostly on the left, atelectasis versus pneumonia.
   2. Mild bibasilar areas of bronchiectasis and bronchial wall
   thickening  suggest peribronchial inflammation.
   3. Lingular atelectasis without suspicious lesion for neoplasia.
   4. Severe fatty liver and ascites.
   5. Bilateral gynecomastia.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypoxia
 Currently with normal saturation on room air.  Effusion on
   CT suggestive of volume overload.
   - Currently no evidence of pneumonia.  Hold on antibiotics
   - goal to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess IVF (goal even to
   slightly negative)
   - would not tap as unlikely to be infected
   # Possible UTI: 39 WBC on sediment, but likely related ATN.  Culture
   negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence of UTI on exam.
   - D/C macrobid
   - follow cultures
   # Hypotension
  Likely a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and
   decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction.  Sepsis remains a
   possible cause of hypotension, however coag-neg staph in blood culture
   is likely contaminant.  Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs generally
   clear by CT.  Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.
   Cortisol appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - follow lactate
   - IV thiamine
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - further workup per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  Clots not significiant enough to
   explain hypotension.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings could also
   represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - Outpatient follow up for suspicious lung lesion on CT
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # FEN/GI:  Lytes PRN, Will replete albumin as above.
   # PPX: therapeutic INR, diarrhea
   # Code status
 Full code
   # Dispo: MICU pending stabilization

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath (SOB), jaundice, and diarrhea. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion and bibasilar alveolar opacities on chest CT, which suggests volume overload. He is currently saturating on room air.
2. Possible UTI: The patient has 39 WBC on sediment, but the culture is negative, and he is afebrile with no evidence of UTI on exam.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction. Sepsis is a possible cause, but it is unlikely given the patient's normal WBC and lack of fever.
4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient has rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment, consistent with ATN (Acute Tubular Necrosis). This is likely due to hypotension and borderline hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Diarrhea/Jaundice: The patient has normal abdominal imaging, and his AST/ALT ratio is consistent with acute alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
6. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): The patient has a possible old PE or mixing artifact on CT, but no significant clots to explain his hypotension.
7. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely due to chronic COPD, and his echo does not show evidence of CHF.
8. Afib/Tachycardia: The patient's afib is stable, and he is not in any distress.

The patient's current medications include:

* Midodrine for hypotension
* 25% albumin for volume resuscitation
* IV thiamine
* Nebulizers for COPD
* Home medications for COPD and asthma

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing to keep pressures elevated and avoiding excess IVF
* Monitoring for signs of infection and sepsis
* Following lactate levels
* Renally dosing medications as necessary
* Further workup for hepatology
* Holding hepatotoxic medications
* Starting heparin for INR < 2
* Outpatient follow-up for suspicious lung lesion on CT
* Continuing nebulizers PRN
* Holding Dilt and Sotalol for afib/tachycardia
* Reassessing tomorrow and monitoring on tele

The patient's disposition is pending stabilization in the MICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening shortness of breath, jaundice, and diarrhea. He has a pleural effusion on chest CT scan, which is suggestive of volume overload. He is hypotensive and has a rising creatinine level with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He also has a diagnosis of right-sided colitis and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently on antibiotics, but they are being held due to the possibility of contamination. The patient is also receiving midodrine and 25% albumin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusion on chest CT scan and bibasilar alveolar opacities on the left are suggestive of pneumonia.
	* Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and bilateral pleural effusion increase the risk of developing ARDS.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac Arrest: The patient's hypotension and rising creatinine level increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
	* Cardiac Failure: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and COPD increase the risk of cardiac failure.
3. Hepatic Complications:
	* Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's abnormal LFTs and rising bilirubin level increase the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.
	* Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's rising creatinine level and abnormal LFTs increase the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's diarrhea and abdominal pain increase the risk of developing sepsis.
	* Intestinal Ischemia: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and COPD increase the risk of developing intestinal ischemia.
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's pleural effusion and abnormal LFTs increase the risk of developing sepsis.
	* Pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusion and bibasilar alveolar opacities on the left are suggestive of pneumonia.
6. Other Complications:
	* Dehydration: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting increase the risk of dehydration.
	* Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's abnormal LFTs and rising creatinine level increase the risk of developing electrolyte imbalance.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor his vital signs closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and hepatic encephalopathy. Additionally, the patient's antibiotics should be adjusted based on the results of his sputum culture and blood cultures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-inch tall individual with a weight not specified. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure ranging from 84/41 mmHg to 113/73 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on a bipap mask.

The patient's laboratory results show normal cortisol levels, but abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated alkaline phosphatase (184 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The patient's blood chemistry results also show elevated creatinine (1.6 mg/dL) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, as well as hypertension, benign liver function abnormalities, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, which was last administered on September 30, 08:00 AM.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and acute exacerbation of COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFIB) increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) may indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of pneumonia and the presence of an arterial line and central venous catheter increase the risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and the presence of an arterial line and central venous catheter increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted with worsening shortness of breath (SOB), jaundice, and diarrhea, and was found to have pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with right-sided colitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 97% on bipap mask.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine is rising, and his blood pressures are poorly responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). He has also been diagnosed with sepsis, and his blood cultures are pending.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently taking anticoagulation therapy with coumadin. He has been holding coumadin for the past 24 hours and will start heparin once his international normalized ratio (INR) is less than 2.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 42 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 137 IU/L. His bilirubin is 6.3 mg/dL, and his albumin is 2.8 g/dL.

The patient's diarrhea has been ongoing for one week, and his jaundice is thought to be related to his liver dysfunction. His abdominal imaging is normal, and he is being held on hepatotoxic medications.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE), which is thought to be worsening his baseline respiratory status. He is currently anticoagulated with coumadin, and his INR is 3. He will start heparin once his INR is less than 2.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending stabilization in the MICU.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued progression of AKI, leading to dialysis dependence and increased risk of mortality.
2. Development of septic shock, which could worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Progression of liver dysfunction, leading to increased risk of bleeding and decreased ability to metabolize medications.
4. Development of respiratory failure, which could worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of mortality.
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and liver dysfunction.
6. Development of further complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and COPD."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening

   # Renal failure: 39 WBC, many muddy brown casts on sediment, but likely
   related ATN.  Culture negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence
   of UTI on exam. Stable for the past day. Baseline 0.9.
   -          follow daily creatinine
   -          would avoid aggressive diuresis in the setting of ? unstable
   renal function
   # Hypotension
  Likely [**2-7**] to dehydration in setting of severe
   diarrhea along with decompensation of liver disease. Improved since
   admission but  still somewhat tenuous.
   - Hold off on diuresis
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   # Jaundice/Liver disease: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also
   fits acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic
   picture, especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice. Appears
   eu to somewhat hypervolemic today with peripheral edema on exam and CXR
   with effusion. CT abdomen notable for area of increased density in
   liver.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, jaundice, and diarrhea. The patient has been diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), right-sided colitis, and probable acute alcoholic hepatitis. He is currently receiving treatment with midodrine, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney damage. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
2. Liver disease: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, suggesting liver damage. A liver biopsy may be necessary to determine the exact nature of the liver disease.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increased oxygen requirements and decreased lung function. Close monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the sepsis and potential need for antibiotic therapy.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea is persistent, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the bleeding and potential need for transfusions.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of pulmonary embolism, which may be related to his atrial fibrillation and immobility. Further monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the pulmonary embolism and potential need for anticoagulation therapy.
7. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is worsening, with increased fluid accumulation in the lungs and decreased cardiac output. Close monitoring is necessary to assess the severity of the heart failure and potential need for diuretic therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue midodrine therapy to manage blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
3. Perform a liver biopsy to determine the exact nature of the liver disease.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
5. Consider antibiotic therapy if the patient's sepsis is severe.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding closely and consider transfusions if necessary.
7. Continue anticoagulation therapy to manage the pulmonary embolism.
8. Consider diuretic therapy to manage the patient's heart failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath, jaundice, and diarrhea. He has been diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), right-sided colitis, and probable acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient is currently receiving Coumadin (Warfarin) and has been anticoagulated to a therapeutic range. He is also receiving oxygen therapy and has been treated with antibiotics, which have been held due to lack of evidence of infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 98% on a BiPAP mask. He is currently receiving fluid therapy and has a total fluid balance of 380 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 137 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 42 IU/L. His creatinine level is 1.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of liver disease: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and he has been diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis. Further deterioration of his liver function could lead to complications such as bleeding, encephalopathy, or even liver failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has been diagnosed with ATN. Further deterioration of his renal function could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, or even end-stage renal disease.
3. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but he has not shown any improvement in his symptoms. Further evaluation is needed to rule out the possibility of an underlying infection.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the clot and whether it is causing any symptoms.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been diagnosed with right-sided colitis, and further evaluation is needed to rule out the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including worsening of liver disease, renal failure, infection, pulmonary embolism, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to manage these complications and improve the patient's overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypoxia
 Currently with normal saturation on room air.  Effusion on
   CT suggestive of volume overload.
   - Currently no evidence of pneumonia.  Hold on antibiotics
   - goal to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess IVF (goal even to
   slightly negative)
   - would not tap as unlikely to be infected
   # Possible UTI: 39 WBC on sediment, but likely related ATN.  Culture
   negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence of UTI on exam.
   - D/C macrobid
   - follow cultures
   # Hypotension
  Likely a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and
   decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction.  Sepsis remains a
   possible cause of hypotension, however coag-neg staph in blood culture
   is likely contaminant.  Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs generally
   clear by CT.  Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.
   Cortisol appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - follow lactate
   - IV thiamine
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - further workup per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  Clots not significiant enough to
   explain hypotension.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings could also
   represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - Outpatient follow up for suspicious lung lesion on CT
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # FEN/GI:  Lytes PRN, Will replete albumin as above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath (SOB), and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with right-sided colitis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.4°F)
* Heart rate: 74 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Jaundiced skin
* Mildly injected sclera
* Decreased breath sounds on the right lower lobe (RLL)
* Mild wheezing anteriorly
* Tachycardic
* S1 and S2 heart sounds present, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Abdomen is distended, with vericosities and tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ)
* No rebound or guarding
* Hepatomegaly by percussion

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 7.5-8.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 263 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-150 mg/dL
* Liver function tests (LFTs): Abnormal
* Coagulation studies: PT/PTT/INR: 21.9/32.2/2.1
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* CK/CKMB: 29/<0.01 IU/L
* ALT/AST: 42/137 IU/L
* Alk Phos/T Bili: 184/6.3 IU/L
* Amylase/Lipase: 46/<0.01 IU/L
* Differential-Neuts: 73.5% lymph: 19.7% mono: 3.8% eos: 2.6%
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* LDH: 291 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but there is an effusion on CT suggestive of volume overload, which may lead to hypoxia.
* Possible UTI: The patient's WBC count is 39, which is elevated, but it is likely related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than a urinary tract infection (UTI).
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to dehydration from diarrhea and decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction. Sepsis is also a possible cause of hypotension, but the patient's WBC count is normal, and the coag-neg staph in the blood culture is likely a contaminant.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine is rising, and there are muddy brown casts on the sediment consistent with ATN, likely due to hypotension and borderline hepatorenal syndrome.
* PE: The patient has a pulmonary embolism, which may worsen his respiratory status.
* Diarrhea/Jaundice: The patient's diarrhea and jaundice may be related to acute alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
* COPD/Asthma: The patient's worsening SOB may be due to chronic COPD or asthma.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding antibiotics due to lack of evidence of infection
* Continuing midodrine and 25% albumin therapy for hypotension
* Following lactate levels
* Starting IV thiamine
* Continuing nebulizers PRN for COPD
* Holding Dilt and Sotalol for atrial fibrillation
* Reassessing the patient's code status and disposition."
