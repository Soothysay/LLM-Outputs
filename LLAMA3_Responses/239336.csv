You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a liver transplant recipient in the ICU with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, anoxic brain damage, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/61 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 99% and no mechanical ventilation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's C-diff test was negative, but the patient is still at risk for developing sepsis due to their immunocompromised state and presence of central lines.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and anoxic brain damage puts them at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen their anemia and increase their risk of bleeding complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a significant concern, and further deterioration could lead to end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia could lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and even death if left untreated.
5. Infection: The patient's presence of central lines and immunocompromised state make them susceptible to infections, which could be life-threatening.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases their risk of bleeding complications, which could worsen their anemia and increase their risk of bleeding complications.
7. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's anoxic brain damage is a significant concern, and further deterioration could lead to permanent brain damage or death.
8. Liver Transplant Complications: The patient's liver transplant could be at risk for complications such as rejection, infection, or bleeding, which could worsen their overall condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and liver transplantation, admitted to the ICU with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with tacrolimus, which has been held due to elevated levels. She has been repleted with fluids and electrolytes, and her sodium level is now 160. The patient has also been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is being treated empirically with flagyl.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is still elevated, which can lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, and even death.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has improved, but ARF is still a concern, especially given her history of liver transplantation and possible ATN.
3. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's diarrhea is likely caused by C. difficile, which can lead to severe colitis, sepsis, and even death if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's history of anoxic brain damage makes her more susceptible to further brain damage due to hypoxia, hypercapnia, or other respiratory or cardiac complications.
5. WBCs in Urine: The patient's urine culture is pending, and the presence of WBCs in her urine could indicate a urinary tract infection, which can spread to the kidneys and cause further complications.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are still abnormal, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
7. Liver Transplant Complications: The patient's history of liver transplantation makes her more susceptible to complications such as rejection, bile duct obstruction, and liver failure.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications and improve her outcome."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation and ulcerative colitis, admitted to the ICU with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. She has been receiving antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and has been treated with tacrolimus to prevent rejection. Her current laboratory results show a sodium level of 160, chloride level of 140, and creatinine level of 1.7. She has been receiving IV fluids, including D5W, and has had her sodium level corrected. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/61 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is still elevated, and she may require further correction with sodium bicarbonate instead of sodium chloride.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving, but she still requires close monitoring and adjustment of medications to improve renal function.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) or a flare of ulcerative colitis. She is being treated empirically with flagyl and cipro, and her stools will be monitored for improvement.
4. WBCs in Urine: The patient has WBCs in her urine, which may be a sign of a urinary tract infection. She is being treated with cipro, and her urine will be monitored for improvement.
5. Cognitive Deficits: The patient has cognitive deficits, and her medications, including ritalin, escitalopram, and risperdal, will be continued.
6. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a fluid and electrolyte imbalance, which will require close monitoring and adjustment of her IV fluids and medications.
7. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, which may be exacerbated by her current condition.
8. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure, which may be exacerbated by her current condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium level and adjust her IV fluids and medications as necessary to correct her hypernatremia.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust her medications to improve renal function.
3. Continue to treat the patient's diarrhea empirically with flagyl and cipro, and monitor her stools for improvement.
4. Monitor the patient's WBCs in her urine and adjust her treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cognitive deficits and adjust her medications as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance and adjust her IV fluids and medications as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's anoxic brain damage and adjust her treatment as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's renal failure and adjust her treatment as necessary."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  36 yo F with complicated medical hx--> ESLD
   [**1-26**] PSC s/p transplant X 2 in 4/[**2160**].  Initial transplant c/b acute
   rejection and cerebral edema, course further c/b respiratory failure,
   cardiac arrest and anoxic brain injury now with significant cognitive
   impairment, hypothyroidism, UC, and sz d/o who chronically resides in
   rehab facility.  Transferred to OSH [**12-5**] and to [**Hospital1 54**] floor [**12-6**] for
   several days of abd pain and diarrhea, hypernatremia (154-161) and
   ARF.  Treated empirically for C diff with flagyl (PO at OSH changed to
   IV here).  Due to difficult access and need for frequent blood draws
   was transferred to ICU this am for further management. Renal c/s
   appreciated.  Fluids changed to D5W with slow improvement in
   hypernatremia. Flex sig yesterday--> inflammation c/w colitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until
   # WBCs in urine: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .
   # FEN: sips for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: subQ heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV, PICC assessment [**12-8**]
   .
   # CODE: full code, discussed with patient's husband
   .
   # COMM: With patient and husband
   .
   # DISP: ICU care until access established and sodium stabilized

   several days of abd pain and diarrhea, hypernatremia (154-161) and
   ARF.  Treated empirically for C diff with flagyl (PO at OSH changed to
   IV here).  Due to difficult access and need for frequent blood draws
   was transferred to ICU this am for further management. Renal c/s
   appreciated.  Fluids changed to D5W with slow improvement in
   hypernatremia. Flex sig yesterday--> inflammation c/w colitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including liver transplant, ulcerative colitis, and anoxic brain damage. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, heparin, and morphine. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/71 mmHg. Respiratory support is not required, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total input of 5,620 mL and output of 785 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (Hct 28.7%), mild thrombocytopenia (Plt 104 K/uL), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST 11-7). The patient's potassium levels are low (1.1 mg/dL), and the anion gap is normal. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's anoxic brain damage may lead to permanent neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment, memory loss, and motor dysfunction.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's history of acute renal failure and current liver disease may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to dehydration, seizures, and brain damage.
5. Stress Ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support and prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of VAP.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of DVT.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's complex medical history and current condition require close monitoring and management. The patient's hypokalemia, anoxic brain damage, and renal failure require immediate attention. The patient's stress ulcer and VAP risk require prophylactic measures. The patient's DVT risk requires prophylaxis with heparin. The patient's hypernatremia requires close monitoring and correction. The patient's liver disease requires ongoing management and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.
   - will give d5w at 150 cc / hour
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare
   around potassium replacement
   - continue to monitor, ideally q4h, will draw Q8 to minimize blood
   draws with Na correcting at slow pace
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving
   - adjust medications for improving renal fxn
   - no need for renal ultrasound given improvement in creatinine
   - renal following
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until
   # WBCs in urine: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .
   # FEN: sips for now, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: subQ heparin
   .
   # Access: PIV, PICC assessment [**12-8**]
   .
   # CODE: full code, discussed with patient's husband
   .
   # COMM: With patient and husband
   .
   # DISP: ICU care until access established and sodium stabilized

   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.

   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard, continue D5W at 150, increase free wtare

* Elevated liver enzymes
* Decreased albumin levels

The patient's medical history includes:

* Liver transplantation
* Ulcerative colitis
* Anoxic brain damage
* Acute renal failure
* Hypernatremia
* Hypokalemia
* Hypocalcemia

The patient's current medications include:

* Morphine sulfate
* Metronidazole
* Ciprofloxacin
* Heparin sodium
* Tacrolimus
* Mesalamine
* Ritalin
* Escitalopram
* Risperdal

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation twice, admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia. She has developed acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to volume depletion and may be resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. She also has a high sodium level, which is being treated with sodium bicarbonate and fluid repletion. The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and has been experiencing diarrhea, which is being treated empirically for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient has a liver transplant and is being monitored for potential complications. She has cognitive deficits and is being managed with home medications. The patient's sodium level is still elevated, and her chloride level is 140, which may indicate that she is still dehydrated. The patient's creatinine level has improved, and she is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Dehydration: The patient's sodium level is still elevated, and her chloride level is 140, which may indicate that she is still dehydrated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which may be secondary to volume depletion and may be resolving with aggressive fluid repletion.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is still elevated, which may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and even death.
4. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which may lead to complications such as sepsis, kidney damage, and even death.
5. C. diff Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing C. diff infection due to her history of ulcerative colitis and recent antibiotics use.
6. Liver Transplant Complications: The patient has a history of liver transplantation, which may lead to complications such as rejection, bile duct obstruction, and even death.
7. Cognitive Deficits: The patient has cognitive deficits, which may be due to her liver disease, medications, or other underlying conditions.
8. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, which may lead to long-term cognitive and neurological deficits.
9. Hypokalemia: The patient has a low potassium level, which may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and even cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Hypotassiumemia: The patient has a low potassium level, which may lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and even cardiac arrhythmias."

   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with plan as
   outlined above. She is continuing to have substantial stool output but
   Na is correcting appropriately with free water.  PO intake remains poor
   but she is taking clear liqs
 hard to tell if she is thirsty.  First
   stool is pending but seems most likely output is due to her colitis
   which will likely require steroids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 36 y/o woman with PMH notable for PSC s/p liver
   transplantation X 2 admitted with diarrhea and hypernatremia.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Sodium is climbing between last labs at EMMC (158) and
   labs done here (160). Unclear which fluids patient was transferred on,
   but it appears that she was changed to 1/2NS. I think that patient is
   still dehydrated-FeNA is 0.7%. However, given her aggressive repletion
   with sodium chloride, her chloride is now 140. Would favor further
   repletion with sodium bicarbonate instead of NaCl.  Seen by renal
   started on D5W with improvement.  Na correction 11 points since
   previous blood draw.
   - will decrease D%W to 100 cc / hour, slow down Na correction but
   continue fluid repletion for stool output
   - have consulted renal for input given sodium is so elevated and
   difficult to treat in the setting of her diarrhea and renal
   insufficiency
 renal onboard
   - continue to monitor Na level
   - PICC eval by IV team [**12-8**]
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 3.8 at OSH but now down to 1.7
   on our labs. Likely secondary to volume depletion with possibility of
   ATN that is resolving with aggressive fluid repletion. Also has urine
   eosinophils, so would like to check CBC/diff for eos as well. Has
   gotten ibuprofen lately for pain which could precipitate AIN.  Tacro
   level at EMMC [**12-6**] was 5.6. [**12-9**] level 5.2.
   - restarted tacrolimus with checks every AM
   - trend creatinine
 improving to 1.1 [**12-9**]
   - renal following
   - issue resolved
   .
   # Diarrhea: Unknown when most recent antibiotics were given but due to
   chronic institutionalization and h/o C diff in the past, C diff is
   likely. Could also represent flare of ulcerative colitis but stools not
   necessarily bloody per records and husband.
   - cover empirically for C diff with flagyl
   - add on cipro given h/o UC
   - ? UC flare--> c/w findings by liver flexsigmoidoscopy
   - guaiac stools prn, trend crits
   - send C-diff toxin, last c-diff [**12-4**] from EMMC was negative
   - continue mesalamine
   - hold steroids until CMV cx is negative
   .
   # UTI: GNRs -> on cipro, await sensitivities.
   .
   # Liver transplant: pt with liver ransplant
   -cont tacrolimus
   -will start Valcyte to cover for CMV, will await cx results
   -tacro levels daily, follow hep recs re: dosing
   .
   # Cognitive deficits: Continue home medications, including ritalin,
   escitalopram, and risperdal.
   .

   Critical Care
   Present for key portions of history and exam. Agree with plan as
   outlined above. She is continuing to have substantial stool output but
   Na is correcting appropriately with free water.  PO intake remains poor
   but she is taking clear liqs
 hard to tell if she is thirsty.  First
   stool is pending but seems most likely output is due to her colitis
   which will likely require steroids.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of liver transplantation twice, admitted to the ICU with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. She has a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and is being treated with antibiotics, steroids, and other medications. The patient's sodium levels are still elevated, and she is being repleted with sodium bicarbonate. Her creatinine levels are improving, and she is being monitored for signs of acute tubular necrosis. The patient is also being treated for a possible urinary tract infection and is being followed up with a gastroenterologist and a nephrologist.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are still elevated, and if not corrected, can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are improving, but if not monitored closely, can lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely caused by her ulcerative colitis, and if not managed properly, can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient is being treated for a possible urinary tract infection, and if not treated promptly, can lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and even death.
5. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: The patient is being treated with Valcyte to prevent CMV infection, and if not treated promptly, can lead to severe illness and even death.
6. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, and if not managed properly, can lead to further brain damage, cognitive impairment, and even death.
7. Liver Transplant Rejection: The patient has had two liver transplants, and if not monitored closely, can lead to liver transplant rejection, which can be life-threatening.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's poor PO intake and diarrhea can lead to malnutrition, which can further complicate her condition.
9. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypernatremia and hypokalemia, can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
10. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state can make her more susceptible to infections, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly."
