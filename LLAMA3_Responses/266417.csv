   - Insulin gtt started at 10, then to 15 with two boluses of 10 units.
   - Added lyspro 10 units after gtt off
   - Urine output briefly fell to 15 mL/hr, so bloused 500 cc NS.
   - On the floor gave 2 L NS, then 1 L 40 mEq KCl in [**11-28**] NS, then 500 cc
   NS, then 1 L 40 mEq KCl in [**11-28**] NS
   - Was agitated in context of moving him and re-dressing IJ (despite
   propofol infusion at 80 with 30 bolus). Continued to struggle,
   therefore switched to Fent. Versed from propofol.
   - Placed [**Name (NI) 1950**]
   - Friend [**Name (NI) 12259**] called around 20:00 to ask about how he is doing - by
   that stage K WNLs and glucose in 200s.
   - Has been combative overnight, so Versed increased around 5 a.m. from
   6 to 8.

   Microbiology: None.
   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12301**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated today but remains disoriented and agitated
   Diabetic ketoacidosis resolved
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue supportive care and re-institute cardiac medications
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .

   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

Summary:

The patient is a 94 kg male who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He was in a hyperosmolar, likely non-ketotic hyperglycemic state, which resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, leading to heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension, and collapse. The patient was intubated and sedated due to combativeness. Laboratory results show hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of type II diabetes, and his A1c level is 11, indicating chronic high hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Complete heart block: The patient's heart block may be due to electrolyte disturbances, and it is essential to monitor his EKG and telemetry closely.
	* Ischemia/infarction: The patient's two-vessel coronary artery disease may have contributed to his ischemic symptoms, and it is crucial to monitor his cardiac enzymes and EKG.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's sedation and intubation may increase his risk of developing pneumonia.
	* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but he may require weaning from sedation and extubation once his lab values are stable.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure may be due to ATN, which is often seen in patients with diabetes and hypertension.
	* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's history of type II diabetes and hypertension increases his risk of developing chronic kidney disease.
4. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, if not managed properly.
	* Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may exacerbate his cardiac arrhythmias and other metabolic complications.
5. Infection:
	* Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and respiratory status increase his risk of developing sepsis.
	* Wound infections: The patient's central lines and other invasive devices may increase his risk of developing wound infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including EKG and telemetry, to detect any changes in his cardiac rhythm or function.
2. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia aggressively to prevent further complications.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely, including creatinine and urine output, to detect any signs of ATN or chronic kidney disease.
4. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy, and consider weaning the patient from sedation and extubation once his lab values are stable.
5. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or nephrologist to further manage the patient's cardiac and renal complications."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was also
   dramatically hyperkalemic and hyperglycemic on presentation.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiologies include infarctive, related to electrolyte disturbance
   (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), toxic (accidental versus intentional).
   Infarction unlikely given enzyems, atypical for electrolyte
   disturbance, more likely toxic. Prolonged QRS could relate to either
   toxicity, particularly with tricyclics, but may also results from
   hyperkalemia. Patient takes metoprolol at home, is somewhat erratic
   with medications and did not respond to atropine. Concerning for
   beta-blocker overdose, toxic and ischemic. UTox and STox panels
   negative (including for ASA).
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction as above
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below)
   - Toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Coming down with correction of hyperglycemia. Insulin, calcium chloride
   in ED, as above. Unclear cause: S/p infarcted tissue worth considering,
   but lactate 3.0. Tumor lysis unlikely based on normal CBC, but need to
   check LDH. Toxicology clear.
   - Continue insulin IV drip (started at 10, gave another 20 bolus and
   running at 15 now).
   - Will give Kayexelate later
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (50%, 550 cc, 22 BPM, PEEP 8 cm
   H2O).
   - Continue until stable lab values, then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes q8h
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Repeat echo when improved
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension appears out of proportion to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. Etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] was also
   dramatically hyperkalemic and hyperglycemic on presentation.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiologies include infarctive, related to electrolyte disturbance
   (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), toxic (accidental versus intentional).
   Infarction unlikely given enzyems, atypical for electrolyte
   disturbance, more likely toxic. Prolonged QRS could relate to either
   toxicity, particularly with tricyclics, but may also results from
   hyperkalemia. Patient takes metoprolol at home, is somewhat erratic
   with medications and did not respond to atropine. Concerning for
   beta-blocker overdose, toxic and ischemic. UTox and STox panels
   negative (including for ASA).
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction as above
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below)
   - Toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Coming down with correction of hyperglycemia. Insulin, calcium chloride
   in ED, as above. Unclear cause: S/p infarcted tissue worth considering,
   but lactate 3.0. Tumor lysis unlikely based on normal CBC, but need to
   check LDH. Toxicology clear.
   - Continue insulin IV drip (started at 10, gave another 20 bolus and
   running at 15 now).
   - Will give Kayexelate later
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (50%, 550 cc, 22 BPM, PEEP 8 cm
   H2O).
   - Continue until stable lab values, then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes q8h
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Repeat echo when improved
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension appears out of proportion to
   bradycardia. Now paced and hypertensive. Will allow to be slightly
   hypertensive at present, given that we do not know typical range (but
   likely has untreated hypertension). Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk
   of cerebral hypoperfusion in this patient.
   - Presently elevated with pacing and depressed slightly by vent and
   sedation.
   - Follow and re-titrate medications.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient presents with a complex medical condition involving multiple organ systems. The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, and he was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive on admission. He was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), complete heart block, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hyperglycemia (glucose levels ranging from 103 to 219 mg/dL)
* Hyperkalemia (potassium levels ranging from 4.3 to 6.9 mEq/L)
* Elevated creatinine levels (1.3 to 1.5 mg/dL)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion on chest radiograph

The patient's medical history includes:

* Type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1c 11%)
* Coronary artery disease (two-vessel disease)
* Hypertension
* Chronic kidney disease

The patient's current medications include:

* Insulin sliding scale
* Glargine 10 mg QHS
* Metoprolol (pending toxicology results)
* Aspirin
* Statin
* Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg

The patient's physical examination findings include:

* Bradycardia
* Hypotension
* Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* No femoral bruits

The patient's medical complications include:

* Complete heart block
* Hyperkalemia
* Acute renal failure
* Mild pulmonary edema
* Small left pleural effusion

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Correction of laboratory abnormalities (hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure)
* Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
* No Kayexelate
* Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
* TID chemistry for now
* Sedation and intubation for respiratory support
* Pacing transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus rhythm
* Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that heart block was provoked
* Restart statin and aspirin
* Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
* Watch for hypertension and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation
* Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use ISS
* Continue to replete K as necessary
* Follow urine osmolality and electrolytes
* Microscopy for signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation, asystole)
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* Chronic kidney disease progression
* Cardiovascular complications (e.g., myocardial infarction, heart failure)

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve his clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dizziness, chest pain, and heart block. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, and a temporary epicardial pacing wire was inserted.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 99 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/89 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and the ventilator is set to assist-respiratory mode with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, indicating potential sepsis. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated at 0.04 ng/mL, suggesting possible cardiac injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's medical history includes a history of hypertension, and the patient was prescribed lisinopril, which was not started due to hyperkalemia. The patient was also prescribed metoprolol, which was not started due to concerns about withdrawal.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels suggest potential sepsis.
2. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and abnormal electrolyte levels may indicate cardiac injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 97%.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's glucose level is elevated at 353 mg/dL, and the patient's blood ketone level is not reported.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 6.9 mmol/L, which may require treatment.
6. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium level is low at 2.5 mg/dL, which may require treatment.
7. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium level is low at 1.2 mg/dL, which may require treatment.
8. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient's history of hypertension and the patient's recent discontinuation of lisinopril may put the patient at risk for withdrawal syndrome.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Administration of antibiotics and antifungals as indicated.
3. Management of hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
4. Treatment of cardiac injury and potential sepsis.
5. Weaning from invasive ventilation and nasal cannula oxygen delivery.
6. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal syndrome.
7. Management of DKA if present.

The patient's code status is ""full code,"" and the patient's disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative, does not [**Doctor Last Name 12312**] out as pt risk given being [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 12313**]ion given fever, CXR, U/A, blood cx NGTD.
   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative, does not [**Doctor Last Name 12312**] out as pt risk given being [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 12313**]ion given fever, CXR, U/A, blood cx NGTD.
   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .

   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He was diagnosed with complete heart block and was placed on temporary pacing. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He was found to have hyperkalemia, which was likely secondary to acute on chronic hyperglycemia. The patient was sedated and intubated due to combativeness and is currently on invasive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Complete heart block may lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
	* Hypertension may lead to cardiac hypertrophy and increased risk of cardiac events.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Prolonged sedation and intubation may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or tracheal stenosis.
	* Invasive ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute renal failure (ARF) may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
	* Hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and increased risk of cardiac events.
4. Metabolic Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
	* Hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and increased risk of cardiac events.
5. Infection Complications:
	* Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures may lead to hospital-acquired infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), or surgical site infections (SSIs).
6. Neurological Complications:
	* Prolonged sedation and intubation may lead to delirium, seizures, or neurological damage.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's cardiac, respiratory, renal, and metabolic status to prevent and manage potential complications."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative, does not [**Doctor Last Name 12312**] out as pt risk given being [**Name8 (MD) **] MD. [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 12313**]ion given fever, CXR, U/A, blood cx NGTD.
   -          Pscyh consult
   -          CIWA with valium prn
   -          Haldol for intractable agitation
   -          Daily EKGs
   # Complete heart block.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction. Toxicology  has broadly
   been negative, with metoprolol still pending.
   - Evaluate for ischemia/infarction (see below)
   - Correct laboratory abnormalities (see below) and follow telemetry and
   EKG.
   - F/u toxicology for metoprolol
   - Continue to pace transvenously with lower threshold now in sinus
   rhythm
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PPM depending on etiology
 unlikely given probably related
   to electrolyte disturbance
   .
   # Hyperkalemia.
   Likely secondary to acute on chronic (as suggested by A1c)
   hyperglycemia. Reduced by insulin/correction of K. [**Month (only) 8**] be total body
   depleted.
   - Insulin sliding scale and 10 units glargine QHS
   - No Kayexelate
   - Continue to supplement potassium as necessary with goal 4
   - TID chemistry for now
   .
   # Respiratory status.
   Sedated and intubated. Presently on AC (40%, 550 cc, 14 BPM, PEEP 5 cm
   H2O). Indication for intubation was combativeness in ED. No indication
   at present, particularly given presenting state resolving.
   - Continue until stable lab values then wean sedation and extubate.
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Two vessel disease, likely without stents. Ischemic etiology possible,
   particularly if sinus node infarcted. However, enzymes are presently
   flat. LVEF 55% in [**2117**], but may be less now.
   - Cycle enzymes, with one more set
   - Monitor with telemetry
   - Repeat 12 lead EKG
   - Appears to have been on aspirin previously - will restart
   - Restart statin
   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN
   .
   FEN:
   No diet until hyperK and hyperGly resolved, then tube feeds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Consider outpatient stress test in future if it is determined that
   heart block was provoked
   - Likely no need for echo at present (as on previous plan)
   .
   # Hypertension
   Hypotensive on arrival. Hypotension seemed somewhat out of proportion
   to bradycardia. Possible that arrhythmic state was missed. Paced and
   hypertensive early, with some resolution of hypertension when pacing
   reduced and developed sinus rhythm. Now hypertensive when sedation
   weaned. Likely hypertension at baseline, but no clear use of
   antihypertensive. Will aim for SBP > 110, given risk of cerebral
   hypoperfusion in this patient who is likely hypertensive at baseline.
   - Hydralazine 10 mg IV q2h prn for SBP > 160 mm Hg
   - Watch today and begin ongoing antihypertensives after extubation.
   .
   # Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state (326 mOsms)
   Secondary to very poorly controlled hyperglycemia of diabetes II. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been elevated for some time, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 543**] now dramatic enough to
   become symptomatic. A1c consistent with chronic high hyperglycemia.
   Hemoglobin glycosylation is time dependent, so A1c should reflect poor
   control and chronicity more than this acute event.
   - Continue to adjust standing insulin (now glargine 10 mg QHS) and use
   ISS
   - Continue to replete K as necessary
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Interestingly, patient creatinine at admission was 0.7,  later the same
   day, was 1.3, now 1.5. Seems likely that there was acute injury in
   context of hypotension, but rapid accumulation of creatinine
   impressive. UOP dropped off yesterday to < 15 cc/hr, but now output is
   impressive
 possible ATN. Proteinuria c/w poorly controlled diabetic
   kidney disease.
   - Follow urine Osms and lytes.
   - Microscopy for signs of ATN

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of dizziness, chest pain, and heart block. He was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive by EMS and was subsequently intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. His laboratory results show hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperglycemia, which are likely related to his diabetes and electrolyte disturbances. He also has acute kidney injury and is at risk for respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if his condition does not improve.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of heart block and is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is at risk for developing sepsis.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk for further kidney damage.
5. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is at risk for developing a hyperglycemic crisis.
6. Hypertensive crisis: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk for developing a hypertensive crisis.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a fever and is at risk for developing pneumonia.
8. SIRS: The patient has a fever and is at risk for developing SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome).

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to adjust his insulin sliding scale and potassium levels as necessary.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and vasopressors as needed.
4. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a medical ward once his condition stabilizes.
5. Consider performing a stress test or echocardiogram to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status.
6. Consider performing a CT scan or MRI to further evaluate the patient's renal status.
7. Consider performing a chest X-ray to further evaluate the patient's respiratory status.
8. Consider performing a blood culture to further evaluate the patient's sepsis risk."

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.
   Consider infection given fever, specifically community acquired PNA as

   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given
   agitation. Lowest on the list is TTP, given thrombocytopenia, AMS,
   hematuria, however pt without significant anemia and thrombocytopenia
   mild.
   - Check hemolysis labs for e/o hemolytic anemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
 BRADYCARDIA
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.
   Consider infection given fever, specifically community acquired PNA as
   pt with aspiration risk and making purulent sputum. CNS infection on
   the ddx, however pt unable to cooperate for LP. Brain stem infarction
   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given
   agitation. Lowest on the list is TTP, given thrombocytopenia, AMS,
   hematuria, however pt without significant anemia and thrombocytopenia
   mild.
   - Check hemolysis labs for e/o hemolytic anemia

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He was diagnosed with complete heart block and was placed on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He was treated with medications for hypertension, diabetes, and heart block, and was also given antibiotics for a possible infection. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is agitated and delirious. He has a fever and is producing purulent sputum, which is concerning for community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's platelet count is low, and he has mild thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and purulent sputum suggest a possible infection, such as community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's platelet count is low, which could be a sign of an underlying infection.
2. Heart Block: The patient's complete heart block could be a sign of an underlying cardiac condition, such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as kidney disease or electrolyte imbalance.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as infection or autoimmune disorder.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as kidney disease or electrolyte imbalance.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be a sign of an underlying condition, such as pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular condition, including heart block and hypertension, could lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and agitation could be a sign of an underlying neurological condition, such as encephalitis or brain stem infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for possible infection, such as community-acquired pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm, and consider adjusting medications to manage heart block.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider adjusting medications to manage thrombocytopenia.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting medications to manage acute renal failure.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider adjusting medications to manage respiratory failure.
6. Consider imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular and neurological condition.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or neurologist to further evaluate the patient's condition and develop a plan for management."

   # Altered mental status:
   Vastly improved today. Likely encephalopathy from sedation (occurs in
   30%^ patients with intubation and sedation). Appears not to have
   sustained hypoxic injury
 impression based on exam. Mental status will
   likely continue to improve.
   - Minimize psychotropics
 stop Haldol and continue on PRN basis only
   - Stop CIWA
   - Haldol for intractable agitation, with caution
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc
   # CAP:
   Patchy LLL opacity on wetread and with fever and purulent sputum would
   be concerned for CAP. Periintubation. Poor inspiratory film. No
   leukocytosis, but did have brief fever.. CXR possible fluid. Will
   follow closely. Clinical exam not consistent with PNA
 will follow
   closely. Nonetheless, will continue Rx for CAP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   # Altered mental status:
   Vastly improved today. Likely encephalopathy from sedation (occurs in
   30%^ patients with intubation and sedation). Appears not to have
   sustained hypoxic injury
 impression based on exam. Mental status will
   likely continue to improve.
   - Minimize psychotropics
 stop Haldol and continue on PRN basis only
   - Stop CIWA
   - Haldol for intractable agitation, with caution
   - Daily EKGs to monitor QTc
   # CAP:
   Patchy LLL opacity on wetread and with fever and purulent sputum would
   be concerned for CAP. Periintubation. Poor inspiratory film. No
   leukocytosis, but did have brief fever.. CXR possible fluid. Will
   follow closely. Clinical exam not consistent with PNA
 will follow
   closely. Nonetheless, will continue Rx for CAP.
   - F/u CXR final read
   - Continue azithromycin
   - Switch ceftriaxone to cefpodoxime.
   - F/u sputum cx
   Thrombocytopenia: Mild, possibly secondary to HSC vs acute infection
   per above.
   - Monitor platelets
   - If continues to fall will DC sub cutaneous heparin
   # Complete heart block. Resolved. Most likely in the setting of
   hyperkalemia, which can cause AV blocks.
   Etiology as described above. Other major differential would be
   infarctive, also consistent with otherwise unexplained chest pain, but
   EKG and enzymes not consistent with infarction therefore unlikely. BB

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever, and the CXR shows patchy LLL opacity, which may indicate pneumonia. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the infection needs to be closely monitored.
2. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which can be a sign of delirium. The patient is receiving benzodiazepines, but the doctor plans to minimize psychotropics and stop Haldol.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has mild thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to heparin or an acute infection. The patient's platelet count needs to be monitored, and if it continues to fall, the doctor may need to discontinue subcutaneous heparin.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia, which resolved. However, the doctor needs to continue monitoring the patient's potassium levels.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has coronary artery disease, and the doctor needs to continue monitoring for any signs of active issues.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and the doctor needs to continue monitoring and managing it.
7. Diabetes/Non-ketotic hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state: The patient had a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemic state, which resolved. However, the doctor needs to continue monitoring the patient's blood glucose levels.
8. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which resolved. However, the doctor needs to continue monitoring the patient's renal function.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for these complications, including antibiotics for pneumonia, antipsychotics for delirium, and medications to manage hypertension and hyperglycemia. The doctor plans to continue monitoring the patient's condition and making adjustments to treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain, bradycardia, and hypotension. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.5°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm
* Blood pressure: 172/91 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Agitation and sedation
* No chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* No c/c/e (cyanosis, clubbing, edema) in extremities
* No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas on skin

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.8-8.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6-12.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 122-138 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26-35 mEq/L
* Electrolytes: sodium 137-138 mEq/L, potassium 4.1-4.5 mEq/L, chloride 102-103 mEq/L
* Glucose: 103-199 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* LDH: 215 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with:

* Complete heart block
* Hyperkalemia
* Mild thrombocytopenia
* Non-ketotic hyperglycemic state
* Acute renal failure
* Pneumonia (probable)

The patient's plan includes:

* Minimizing psychotropics and stopping Haldol
* Continuing antibiotics for CAP
* Monitoring platelets and considering switching to cefpodoxime
* Monitoring QTc and EKGs
* Continuing metoprolol tartrate for hypertension
* Obtaining information on home BP medications
* Regular diabetic diet
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia progression
* Sepsis
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypertension
* Renal failure
* Hyperkalemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Bradycardia
* Delirium and confusion

The patient's condition is stable, and the plan is to continue monitoring and adjusting treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   This man presents after experiencing chest pain, with the EMS
   subsequently finding him bradycardic and hypotensive. He appears to
   have developed complete heart block. He was in a hyperosmolar, (likely)
   non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. We hypothesize that this hyperglycemia
   resulted in dramatic hyperkalemia and some hyponatremia, which in turn
   resulted in heart block and junctional rhythm, hypotension and his
   collapse.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Alcohol vs benzo withdrawl on the ddx although
   tox negative and pt and companion adamantly deny alcohol abuse.

   the ddx, however pt unable to cooperate for LP. Brain stem infarction
   also possible, however, pt also unable to cooperate for MRI or CT given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male who presented to the emergency department with chest pain, bradycardia, and hypotension. He was found to have complete heart block and was in a hyperosmolar, non-ketotic hyperglycemic state. He was treated with insulin and fluids, and his hyperkalemia and hyponatremia were corrected. He remains agitated and has a fever of 101.5°F (38.6°C). His mental status is altered, and he is unable to cooperate with a lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. He has mild thrombocytopenia and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and purulent sputum suggest the possibility of infection, including community-acquired pneumonia or a central nervous system infection.
2. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and fever may increase the risk of seizures.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's fever and cough may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's complete heart block and hyperkalemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: The patient's hyperkalemia and hyponatremia may increase the risk of renal failure.
6. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's thrombocytopenia and hematuria may increase the risk of hemolytic anemia.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and fever may increase the risk of delirium.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status and fever suggest the possibility of infection, and he should be treated with antibiotics. His complete heart block and hyperkalemia should be monitored closely, and he should be treated with antiarrhythmic medications if necessary. His thrombocytopenia should be monitored closely, and he should be treated with platelet transfusions if necessary. His hyperglycemia should be treated with insulin and fluids, and his electrolyte imbalance should be monitored closely. He should be monitored closely for signs of respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, and hemolytic anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old male who was admitted to the ICU with chest pain, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing fever, agitation, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 172/91 mmHg.

The patient has been diagnosed with complete heart block, likely caused by hyperkalemia, and has been treated with labetalol. The patient's mental status has improved, and the benzodiazepine was discontinued. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 97% on room air.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient's laboratory results show mild thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia or acute infection. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for potassium, which was elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's complete heart block and hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and encephalopathy can progress to seizures, coma, or brain death.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's fever and respiratory support can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest.
4. Renal complications: The patient's hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia can cause acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's fever and respiratory symptoms can lead to sepsis, pneumonia, or other infections.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications or hematoma formation.

The patient's treatment plan includes monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias, neurological deterioration, respiratory failure, and renal dysfunction. The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for pneumonia, and the dosage of labetalol will be adjusted as needed. The patient's glycemic control will be closely monitored, and the patient will be educated on the importance of proper nutrition and hydration."
