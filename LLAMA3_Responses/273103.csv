You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypotension and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is receiving vasopressor support with phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) and has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, tobramycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and troponin-T, indicating septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level and troponin-T suggest that the sepsis may be causing organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications.
2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor requirement indicate that they are at risk for septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
3. Worsening of impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of further skin breakdown, which can lead to complications such as infection and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed promptly.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation indicates that they are at risk for respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor requirement indicate that they are at risk for hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
7. Infection progression: The patient's UTI and septic shock suggest that the infection may be progressing, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
8. Organ failure: The patient's elevated lactate level and troponin-T suggest that they may be at risk for organ failure, including cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx
   - f/u blood, urine cx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, lungs sound mostly clear, although he
   is total body volume overloaded

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic CHF, MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and respiratory distress. He has a UTI with unusual organisms, and his condition is complicated by hypovolemia, septic shock, and chronic malnutrition. He has several medical issues, including anemia, hypernatremia, alkalosis, and venous clots, and is being treated with various medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and low-grade fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen his condition and lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of ARF, which could be exacerbated by his hypovolemia and septic shock.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of respiratory distress, which could worsen his hypoxia and lead to further complications.
4. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's history of DVT and presence of non-occlusive thrombus in his left cephalic vein suggest the possibility of VTE, which could worsen his condition and lead to pulmonary embolism.
5. Pressure Ulcer: The patient's L heel stage II pressure ulcer suggests the possibility of further pressure ulcer development, which could worsen his condition and lead to infection.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's low albumin levels suggest the possibility of malnutrition, which could worsen his condition and lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes in his condition.
2. Consider adjusting his medications to optimize his treatment and prevent further complications.
3. Consider implementing measures to prevent VTE, such as using sequential compression devices and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Consider implementing measures to prevent pressure ulcer development, such as turning and repositioning the patient regularly and using pressure-redistributing mattresses.
5. Consider implementing measures to prevent malnutrition, such as providing adequate nutrition and hydration and monitoring the patient's weight and albumin levels regularly.
6. Consider consulting with a wound care specialist to optimize the patient's wound care and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be pulm or urine. He has very psoitive
   U/A. Of note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in
   recent past

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Skin breakdown in the buttock and healing ulcers on the toes
* Warm, dry skin with a rash
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present
* Extremities with 4+ edema

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Hypovolemic shock vs. septic shock
* Chronic heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%
* Urinary tract infection with unusual organisms
* Leukocytosis with potential infection
* Elevated troponin levels with potential cardiac damage
* Acute renal failure with prerenal azotemia
* Hypernatremia with potential free water loss
* Alkalosis with potential contraction alkalosis
* Venous clots with non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein
* Atrial fibrillation with potential embolic risk
* Hypertension with potential end-organ damage
* Type 2 diabetes with potential complications
* Anemia with potential iron and B12/folate deficiencies
* L heel stage II pressure ulcer with potential complications
* Sacral/buttock rash with potential skin breakdown

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications may arise:

* Sepsis with potential multi-organ failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias with potential embolic risk
* Acute kidney injury with potential need for dialysis
* Respiratory failure with potential need for mechanical ventilation
* Wound infection with potential sepsis
* Skin breakdown with potential deep tissue injury
* Pressure ulcers with potential deep tissue injury
* Venous thromboembolism with potential pulmonary embolism
* Gastrointestinal bleeding with potential need for transfusion

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Gentle IVF with goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, and UOP>30 cc/hr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, who presented to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with triple antibiotics. The patient has a complex medical history, including frequent UTIs with unusual organisms, and has undergone previous treatments with metronidazole and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and low-grade fever are concerning for sepsis, which could worsen his condition.
2. CHF: The patient's EF is 45%, and he is at risk for further decompensation due to fluid overload.
3. UTI: The patient's UTI could lead to further complications, such as kidney damage or sepsis.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could indicate an infection, which would require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Elevated Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin levels could indicate cardiac damage or acute renal failure.
6. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, indicating acute renal failure, which could worsen his condition.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could lead to further complications, such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Alkalosis: The patient's alkalosis could be caused by contraction alkalosis from insensible losses, which could worsen his respiratory status.
9. Venous clots: The patient has a non-occlusive thrombus in his left cephalic vein and a history of DVT, which could lead to further complications.
10. Pressure ulcers: The patient has stage II pressure ulcers on his heels, which could worsen if not properly cared for.
11. Sacral/Buttock Rash: The patient has a large area of macular erythema over his entire buttock and lower back, which could indicate cellulitis or a skin infection.
12. FEN: The patient has low albumin levels due to chronic malnutrition, which could worsen his condition if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotics and antifungals as needed based on culture results.
3. Consider adding a vasopressor to support the patient's blood pressure.
4. Continue to manage the patient's fluid status carefully to avoid further fluid overload.
5. Consider consulting wound care and nutrition specialists to develop a plan for the patient's pressure ulcers and malnutrition.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely to avoid further complications.
7. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis medication to the patient's regimen.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider adjusting his oxygen therapy as needed.
9. Consider consulting a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status.
10. Continue to educate the patient and his family on his condition and treatment plan."

   - had family meeting, family feels that patient would DNR/DNI but has
   not finalized so patient continues to be FULL CODE, family to decide
   about PEG as well, will have repeat family meeting today
   - urology c/s done, no suprapubic or CBI
   - scotral u/s done: Significant subcutaneous scrotal swelling with no
   hypervascularity and no gas within the tissues identified. This edema
   may be due to third spacing but ultrasound is unable to further
   characterize. A clinical evaluation is recommended to exclude a
   subcutaneous infectious process, and if further imaging is required, a
   CT could be performed. 2) No evidence of an intratesticular mass. No
   evidence of epididymitis or orchitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - fem line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic CHF, MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient has a significant amount of subcutaneous swelling in his scrotum, which may be due to third spacing, and an ultrasound has been recommended to further characterize the edema. He also has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball in the bladder and chronic foley catheter.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension, which are concerning for sepsis. He has a positive urine culture with over 100,000 GNR, and his albumin level is 1.6 g/dL, indicating malnutrition.

The patient's medical conditions include chronic heart failure with an EF of 45%, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. He also has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms and has grown numerous organisms from his urine in the past.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing to monitor his blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Administering IVF boluses as needed to maintain a MAP of 65 and CVP of 10-12.
3. Continuing to treat his UTI with triple antibiotics.
4. Monitoring his urine output and adjusting his fluid management accordingly.
5. Discussing with the family the options for feeding, including PEG or TPN.
6. Elevating his scrotum for comfort and administering low-dose morphine for pain control.
7. Monitoring his leukocytosis and infection work-up.
8. Continuing to follow his CHF and ARF, and adjusting his treatment plan accordingly.
9. Monitoring his troponin levels and adjusting his treatment plan accordingly.
10. Continuing to monitor his hypernatremia and adjusting his treatment plan accordingly.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's positive urine culture and leukocytosis.
2. UTI and kidney infection due to the patient's history of frequent UTIs and chronic foley catheter.
3. CHF and cardiac failure due to the patient's history of systolic CHF and atrial fibrillation.
4. ARF and acute kidney injury due to the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and decreased clearance.
5. Hypernatremia and dehydration due to the patient's history of malnutrition and decreased fluid intake.
6. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to the patient's history of DVT and IVC filter.
7. Pressure ulcers and skin breakdown due to the patient's history of malnutrition and decreased mobility.
8. Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's history of respiratory distress and chronic lung disease.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure his optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU who has undergone various interventions, including a family meeting to discuss DNR/DNI status, urology consultation, and ultrasound examination of the scrotum. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone changes to their medical and family history. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and troponin-T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and creatinine levels may indicate sepsis, which could lead to septic shock if not managed promptly.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's lack of skin assessment and the presence of peripheral edema may indicate impaired skin integrity, which could lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers or infections.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a significant amount of fluid intake and output, which may indicate hypovolemia. This could lead to further complications such as shock or organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen therapy and ABG results may indicate respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications such as respiratory arrest.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T levels and cardiac rhythm may indicate cardiac complications, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest.
6. Infections: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of peripheral edema may indicate infections, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis or septic shock.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's alteration in nutrition and lack of caloric intake may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could impact their overall health and recovery.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort through medication and other interventions.
3. Implement strategies to prevent and manage infections, such as maintaining good hygiene and administering antibiotics as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust their fluid intake and output as necessary to prevent hypovolemia.
5. Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan, to further evaluate the patient's scrotal swelling and potential infections.
6. Consult with a nutritionist to develop a plan to meet the patient's nutritional needs and prevent deficiencies.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as a cardiovascular intensive care unit, to manage their cardiac complications and respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - need to discuss long term nutrition plans with family, may need PEG
   for nutrition, as likely not able to keep fluid intravascularly due to
   his low albumin
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - fem line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, MCA CVA, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, who presents from rehab with hypotension and respiratory distress. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. He has a positive urine culture and has grown unusual organisms from his urine in the past. He has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has been receiving gentle IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis. The most likely source of sepsis is the patient's urine, given his positive urine culture.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he has been diagnosed with AKI. The most likely cause of AKI is prerenal azotemia, given the patient's history of heart failure and hypovolemia.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction is 45%, and he has been diagnosed with systolic heart failure. He is at risk for further deterioration of his heart failure, given his hypotension and fluid overload.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, but he has been receiving 6 liters of oxygen. He is at risk for further respiratory distress, given his heart failure and AKI.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is concerning, given his history of frequent UTIs and his current diagnosis of sepsis.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which is concerning given his history of heart failure and AKI.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which is concerning given his history of heart failure and AKI.
8. Alkalosis: The patient's alkalosis is concerning, given his history of heart failure and AKI.
9. Venous Clots: The patient has a non-occlusive thrombus in his left cephalic vein, which is concerning given his history of DVT and IVC filter.
10. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is concerning, given his history of heart failure and AKI.
11. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is concerning, given his history of heart failure and AKI.
12. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient's type 2 diabetes is concerning, given his history of heart failure and AKI.
13. Anemia: The patient's anemia is concerning, given his history of heart failure and AKI.
14. Pressure Ulcer: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer on his heel, which is concerning given his history of malnutrition and incontinence.
15. Sacral/Buttock Rash: The patient has a sacral/buttock rash, which is concerning given his history of malnutrition and incontinence."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow

   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: I suspect hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very
   poor intake since returning to NH per family. However, presence of
   leukocytosis, low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for
   sepsis. Most likely source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of
   note, he has grown numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - gentle IVF as has known CHF
   - continue neo and goal to wean, very low dose, able to wean some
   yesterday, but required a lot of IVFs
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tailor to cx, added tobramycin for better GN
   coverage
   - f/u blood, urine cx - NGTD
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart tomorrow
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in urology, called urology today for eval,
   will f/u recs
 possible suprapubic cath
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - gentle IVFs overnight
   - check urine lytes to calc FEUrea
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Alkalosis: seen on ABG 7.47/39/211, suspect contraction alkalosis
   from insensible losses
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - need to discuss long term nutrition plans with family, may need PEG
   for nutrition, as likely not able to keep fluid intravascularly due to
   his low albumin
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic CHF, MCA CVA, AFib, HTN, and DM II. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 100/56 mmHg, which is concerning for hypovolemia or septic shock. The patient has a history of poor intake and has grown unusual organisms from his urine in the past.
2. CHF: The patient's EF is 45%, and he is intravascularly dry with extravascular overload.
3. UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms. He has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball in the bladder and chronic foley catheter.
4. Pain: The patient is experiencing pain from scrotal edema, and his pain is managed with low-dose morphine.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is 17.4, and he has a low-grade fever. The source of his infection is unclear, but it may be related to his UTI.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may be due to heart failure, acute renal failure, or decreased clearance.
7. ARF: The patient's BUN is 44 mg/dL, and his creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, which is trending downward. The most likely cause is prerenal azotemia.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 148 mmol/L, which has resolved with free water replacement.
9. Alkalosis: The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.47, which may be due to contraction alkalosis from insensible losses.
10. Venous clots: The patient has a non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein, which is felt to be related to his PICC line. He also has a history of right DVT and has been placed on anticoagulation therapy.
11. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with anticoagulation therapy and rate control.
12. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 100/56 mmHg, which is being managed with antihypertensive medication.
13. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient's glucose level is 117 mg/dL, which is being managed with insulin.
14. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 27.8%, which may be due to chronic malnutrition or bleeding.
15. L heel stage II pressure ulcer: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer on his left heel, which is being managed with wound care and pressure relief.
16. Sacral/buttock rash: The patient has a healing unstageable ulcer and a large area of macular erythema over his entire buttock and lower back, which may be due to cellulitis or a skin infection.
17. FEN: The patient has low albumin levels due to chronic malnutrition, which may be related to his poor intake and malabsorption.
18. PPX: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to his chronic malnutrition and poor intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, leukocytosis, and low-grade fever may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. CHF: The patient's EF is 45%, and he is intravascularly dry with extravascular overload, which can lead to worsening heart failure and death.
3. UTI: The patient's history of frequent UTIs with unusual organisms may lead to recurrent infections and sepsis.
4. ARF: The patient's prerenal azotemia may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and death.
5. Venous clots: The patient's non-occlusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein may lead to pulmonary embolism or DVT.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to stroke or heart failure.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to stroke, heart failure, or kidney disease.
8. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient's uncontrolled diabetes may lead to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, or organ failure.
10. L heel stage II pressure ulcer: The patient's pressure ulcer may worsen, leading to infection, sepsis, or amputation.
11. Sacral/buttock rash: The patient's skin infection may worsen, leading to cellulitis, sepsis, or death.
12. FEN: The patient's chronic malnutrition may lead to further complications such as poor wound healing, infection, or death.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing his underlying medical conditions, preventing complications, and promoting his overall health and well-being."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - off pressors now
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - continue abx  for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 psuedomonas and >100,000 GNR #2
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with tobra and zosyn; stopped vanco
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Hypernatermia
 replace with D5W
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding.
   - no peg tube, decided to eat for comfort
   .
   # Pain
 much more comfortable
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI, cont above tx
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 probably at
   new baseline
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi due to low BP
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - starting feeds despite aspiration risk
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis (INR seemed to have
   peaked)
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - PICC line
   .
   # CODE: DNR/DNI, changed yesterday

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of UTIs and has grown unusual organisms from urine, which increases the risk of sepsis. The presence of leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease.
3. Heart Failure (HF): The patient has a history of systolic CHF, and his ejection fraction is 45%. He is at risk for worsening HF due to his poor intake and respiratory status.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of respiratory distress and is at risk for further deterioration due to his poor intake and HF.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and he has a history of chronic anemia. He may require blood transfusions to improve his anemia.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has a history of pressure ulcers and is at risk for further deterioration due to his poor mobility and nutrition.
7. Sacral/Buttock Rash: The patient has a rash on his sacral and buttock areas, which may be due to cellulitis or another underlying condition.
8. Venous Clots: The patient has a history of venous clots and is at risk for further clotting due to his poor mobility and nutrition.
9. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is currently elevated. He may require further treatment to control his blood pressure.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and he may require treatment to correct this condition.
11. Leukocytosis: The patient has a history of leukocytosis, which may be due to an underlying infection or other condition.
12. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, and his blood sugar levels are currently controlled with insulin.
13. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his heart rhythm is currently stable.
14. Chronic Malnutrition: The patient has a history of chronic malnutrition, and his albumin levels are low. He may require further nutrition support to improve his nutritional status.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he has a history of pressure ulcers, sacral/buttock rash, and venous clots. He is at risk for further complications due to his poor intake, respiratory status, and underlying medical conditions."

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's 24-hour events include a discussion with his son about making a DNR/DNI decision, weaning off pressors, and maintaining blood pressures. The patient has a history of allergies to Norvasc, Cipro IV, and an unknown allergen. He has received various antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Tobramycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 114/68 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. He is receiving morphine sulfate for pain control.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.4, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 303 K/uL. His creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is 0.25. The patient's albumin level is 1.6 g/dL, calcium level is 7.1 mg/dL, and magnesium level is 1.8 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, pain control, impaired skin integrity, hypovolemia, and shock. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T level, which may indicate sepsis.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may lead to hypovolemia and decreased blood pressure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is receiving oxygen therapy, which may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, which may indicate cardiac damage or infarction.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated amylase and lipase level, which may indicate gastrointestinal complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination is incomplete, and he may be at risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
8. Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to his underlying medical condition and the use of central lines and other invasive devices."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI
   .
   # ACCESS
   - fem line
   .
   # CODE: FULL, discussing with family today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21
   .
   # L heel stage II pressure ulcer:  Wound care consulted at recent
   admission
   - Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines
   - Support surface -Atmos Air
   - Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn
   - Heels off bed surface at all times
   - Multipodis Splints to B/L LE's
   - Moisturize B/L LE's  with [**Last Name (un) **] Cream
   - Leave Heels open to air.
   - Place ABD or under scrotom and on sides to prevent friction and
   elevate scrotum.
   .
   # Sacral/Buttock Rash: He has healing unstageable ulcers and a large
   area of macular erythema over entire buttock and lower back
   - continue to monitor, possibly cellulitis, although does not appear to
   be spreading
 blanches, likely stage I not active infection
   - would care consult following patient
   .
   # FEN: Low albumin 1.7 due to chronic malnutrition.
   - NPO
 was choking with trial of foods with nurse today
   - see above for nutrition plans
   .
   # PPX:
   - Supratherapuetic INR effective as DVT prophylaxis
   - No bowel regimen in the setting of diarrhea
   - Strict aspiration precautions
   - Mouthcare q6 hours
   - PPI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic malnutrition. He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/68 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 99%. His respiratory support includes non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 17.4 x 10^9/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. His troponin level is elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury. His albumin level is low, indicating malnutrition.

The patient has a history of frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and has been treated with triple antibiotics. He has a large bladder diverticulum with a possible fungus ball in the bladder. He has also had a chronic foley catheter, which was recently changed.

The patient's nutrition plan includes feeding for comfort, with the option of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if he is unable to tolerate oral intake. His pain is managed with low-dose morphine.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis. The most likely source of sepsis is the patient's urinary tract.
2. UTI: The patient has a history of frequent UTIs and has been treated with triple antibiotics. He may require further treatment to clear the infection.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury. He may require further treatment to manage this condition.
4. Cardiac injury: The patient's elevated troponin level suggests possible cardiac injury. He may require further treatment to manage this condition.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's low albumin level indicates malnutrition. He may require further treatment to manage this condition.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a history of pressure ulcers and is at risk for further development of pressure ulcers.
7. Sacral/buttock rash: The patient has a sacral/buttock rash that may be related to cellulitis or other skin infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring for sepsis and UTI
2. Managing acute kidney injury
3. Managing cardiac injury
4. Managing malnutrition
5. Managing pressure ulcers
6. Managing sacral/buttock rash
7. Continuing antibiotics for UTI
8. Continuing pain management with low-dose morphine
9. Continuing nutrition support with feeding for comfort and possible PEG or TPN
10. Continuing to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 89 y.o. M with systolic CHF (EF 45% in [**9-25**]), s/p MCA CVA,
   afib, HTN, and DM II, who presents from rehab with hypotension and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypotension: hypovolemia vs septic shock. He has had very poor intake
   since returning to NH per family. However, presence of leukocytosis,
   low grade fever, and hypotension is concerning for sepsis. Most likely
   source would be urine. He has very psoitive U/A. Of note, he has grown
   numerous unusual organisms from urine in recent past
   - continues to be on low dose neo, will try to wean today
   - IVF boluses as needed as he had poor Po intake and respiratory status
   is stable
   - goal MAP>65, CVP 10-12, UOP >30 cc/hr
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn and tobra for UTI coverage
   - f/u blood
 NGTD
   - urine with >100,000 GNR, no speciation yet
   .
   # UTI: Frequent UTI with unusual organsisms. He has large bladder
   divertic with possible fungus ball in bladder and chronic foley
   - treatment as above with triple abx
   - foley changed in ED
   - urology followed, no change in management at this time,do not think
   suprapubic catheter or CBI is warranted
   .
   # Nutrition
 has been NPO since arrival due to aspiration risk, need
   to discuss with family the options for feeding. Long term care would
   likely require a PEG as his albumin is 1.6 and he has such poor ability
   to keep fluid intravascularly.  If not, consider TPN with eating for
   comfort with known risk of aspiration
   - family talk
   .
   # Pain
 seems to be from scrotal edema, although unable to pinpoint
   exact cause
   - low dose morphine for pain control, is much more comfortable and
   talkative today
   - elevate scrotum for comfort
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Infection w/u as above. Of note, during last admission,
   he was started empirically on Metronidazole on [**12-15**]; however, C. diff
   negative on [**12-16**]
   - flagyl d/c
   - likely from UTI
   .
   # CHF: EF in [**2099**] 45%. On exam, intravascularly dry, extravascularly
   overloaded
   - gentle IVF, but will be careful of CHF
   - oxygen level appropriate on room air despite being positive 6 L
   yesterday
   - hold on lasix tonight while on pressors, but would have low threshold
   to retart if respiratory status changes
   .
   # Elevated Troponin: Suspect some trop leak from heart failure in
   addition to acute renal failure and decreased clearance. EKG paced, pt
   asymptomatic.
   - ruled out bye CEs
   - stable
   .
   # ARF: Baseline 1.2, now 1.4 which is trending downward
 most likely
   prerenal azotemia
   - stable, will continue to follow
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 148 on admission to 143; resolved with free water
   replacement
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Venous clots: He has non-occlusive thrombus within the left cephalic
   vein felt to be [**12-20**] PICC line and stable. He also has hx R DVT s/p IVC
   filter
   -supratherapeutic, holding coumadin
   - continuing to rise, will hold and reverse only if bleeding
   - possible FFP today if patient needs it for PICC line placement
   tomorrow
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   - hold metoprolol tonight while on pressors
   - hold coumadin as supratherapeutic and on antibiotics
   - would restart coumadin when INR less than 2.5
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - hold on home BB and ACEi tonight but restart once off pressors and
   stable as he will benefit from afterload reduction
   .
   # Type 2 Diabetes:
   - continue HISS
   .
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline (28-30); likely ACD; however macrocytosis and
   last B12/folate over 1 year ago
   - check iron, B12/folate
   - transfuse Hct<21

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of systolic CHF, MCA CVA, afib, HTN, and DM II, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress. He has been experiencing poor intake since returning to his nursing home, and his recent urine cultures have grown unusual organisms. He has a large bladder diverticulum with possible fungus ball and chronic foley catheter.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6Â°C, HR 89 bpm, BP 114/68 mmHg, RR 18 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Respiratory support: None
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 heart sounds normal, but with signs of hypovolemia and possible septic shock
* Neurological: Alert and follows simple commands, but with signs of anasarca and possible sepsis
* Laboratory results: Leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and elevated troponin levels, indicating possible sepsis and cardiac injury
* Imaging studies: Not mentioned

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, low-grade fever, and hypotension suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's history of systolic CHF and current signs of hypovolemia and possible septic shock put him at risk for cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated troponin levels and decreased clearance suggest possible acute renal failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels put him at risk for respiratory failure.
* Pressure ulcers: The patient's sacral and buttock rash, as well as his history of malnutrition and chronic foley catheter, increase his risk for pressure ulcers.
* Wound infections: The patient's healing ulcers on his toes and sacral area, as well as his history of UTI, put him at risk for wound infections.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of R DVT and IVC filter, as well as his current supratherapeutic INR, put him at risk for deep vein thrombosis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of chronic foley catheter and possible sepsis put him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis, cardiac failure, and renal failure.
* Administer antibiotics and antifungals as needed to treat the patient's UTI and possible sepsis.
* Provide aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support as needed to manage the patient's hypotension.
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's wound status and provide pressure ulcer care as needed.
* Consider referring the patient to a wound care specialist for further evaluation and treatment of his sacral and buttock rash.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and provide electrolyte replacement as needed.
* Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment of his cardiac condition."
