   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today, 100
   TID [**11-30**] with dilantin level in [**11-30**] am.
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, add back low dose
   propofol if necessary.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, UA and urine cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   extubation tomorrow AM after studies & seizures under control.
   - titrate vent by ABGs
   - wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if possible
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Trend in AM.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs in the
   AM (2 sets 12 hours apart).
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. (diet at facility no potatoes, tomatoes, oranges,
   or bananas due to renal disease). replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: hep sc tid, BM reg, ISS
   .
   #Access: R fem line, R wrist PIV, R antecub PIV. IF BP stable overnight
   d/c fem line in am.
   .
   # CODE: full code, confirmed with patient's wife who is hcp
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4086**] is HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4087**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of right focal motor seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in 2012 and was on Dilantin for a period of time. He presented with seizures three times earlier today, and the differential diagnosis includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic, and primary seizure disorder.

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and is being treated with Acyclovir for possible herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The CSF showed mild elevation of protein, and the patient is being monitored for HSV PCR result. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and the lactate level on admission was elevated, likely due to the seizure activity.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, with decreased VT and FiO2. The patient is responding to voice and has a stable hemodynamic status.

The patient has several medical conditions, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He is also taking several medications, including anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, and statins.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures, and the differential diagnosis includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic, and primary seizure disorder.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's condition deteriorates.
3. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactate level on admission was elevated, and there is a risk of lactic acidosis if the patient's condition deteriorates.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which can be caused by various factors, including medication, infection, and liver disease.
5. ESRD: The patient has ESRD on HD, and there is a risk of complications such as hypertension, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis if the patient's condition deteriorates.
7. CAD: The patient has CAD, and there is a risk of acute coronary syndrome if the patient's condition deteriorates.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a risk of infection if the patient's condition deteriorates.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can be caused by various factors, including medication, infection, and bone marrow suppression.
10. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can be caused by various factors, including medication, infection, and chronic disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing Acyclovir for possible HSV infection.
2. Monitoring the patient's seizure activity and adjusting the medication as necessary.
3. Weaning sedation and titrating the ventilator based on the patient's respiratory status.
4. Continuing HD for ESRD.
5. Monitoring the patient's electrolytes and adjusting the medication as necessary.
6. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting the medication as necessary.
7. Monitoring the patient's liver function tests and adjusting the medication as necessary.
8. Monitoring the patient's platelet count and adjusting the medication as necessary.
9. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin level and adjusting the medication as necessary.
10. Providing education to the patient and family regarding the patient's condition and plan of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today,
   Dilatin level 7.8 this am given additional 300mg x1, to get 100 TID
   [**11-30**]. Dilatin level and free dilatin ([**1-29**] renal failure) to be
   collected 1 hr after 300mg dose this am
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, wean  low dose propofol
   as tolerated.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, and urine cultures
   - Vascular suggest transcranial Doppler to r/o reperfusion syndrome
   non-emergently after MR, EEG. Talk to rads have no equipment to do
   test. Need to contact neuro to see if they do test.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   today  after MR studies & seizures under control.
   -          wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if
   possible
   -          called by rads, ET tube against R tracheal wall, balloon
   hyperinflated, respiratory to adjust
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Stable this AM. Continue to trend
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   -          continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   -          clarify with neuron rads if contrast needed cause may need
   hd tomorrow if getting contrast.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today,
   Dilatin level 7.8 this am given additional 300mg x1, to get 100 TID
   [**11-30**]. Dilatin level and free dilatin ([**1-29**] renal failure) to be
   collected 1 hr after 300mg dose this am
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, wean  low dose propofol
   as tolerated.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, and urine cultures
   - Vascular suggest transcranial Doppler to r/o reperfusion syndrome
   non-emergently after MR, EEG. Talk to rads have no equipment to do
   test. Need to contact neuro to see if they do test.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   today  after MR studies & seizures under control.
   -          wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if
   possible
   -          called by rads, ET tube against R tracheal wall, balloon
   hyperinflated, respiratory to adjust
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Stable this AM. Continue to trend
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   -          continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   -          clarify with neuron rads if contrast needed cause may need
   hd tomorrow if getting contrast.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs with
   flat CK, stable trop (2 sets 12 hours apart).
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. (diet at facility no potatoes, tomatoes, oranges,
   or bananas due to renal disease). replete lytes prn.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of right focal motor seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy. He presented with seizures three times earlier today, which were likely related to his seizure disorder. He is currently intubated for airway protection and is receiving sedation with propofol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show mild elevation of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and normal glucose levels. The CSF cultures are pending. His blood cultures are also pending, and his urine culture showed few bacteria and white blood cells, but was negative.

The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He is currently receiving anticonvulsant medication, antibiotics, and antihypertensive medication.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Seizure recurrence: Given the patient's history of seizures, there is a risk of seizure recurrence while he is in the ICU.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if his respiratory support is not adjusted properly.
3. Infection: The patient's CSF and urine cultures are pending, and there is a risk of infection if these tests come back positive.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's initial lactate level was elevated, and there is a risk of lactic acidosis if his condition deteriorates.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there is a risk of transaminitis if his condition worsens.
6. Renal failure: The patient is currently on hemodialysis, and there is a risk of renal failure if his condition deteriorates.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there is a risk of hypertension if his condition worsens.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and there is a risk of cardiovascular complications if his condition deteriorates.

In conclusion, the patient is currently stable, but there are several potential medical complications that may arise. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure his optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of seizures, status epilepticus, and renal failure, end-stage. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and was found to have a slightly elevated opening pressure. Antibiotics were stopped, and the patient is currently receiving propofol infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate, with normal electrolyte levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Seizure recurrence: Given the patient's history of status epilepticus, there is a risk of seizure recurrence, which could lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and any further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure, which could be life-threatening.
3. Renal failure progression: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a significant concern, and any further deterioration could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
5. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's immobility and risk factors, there is a risk of pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and mortality.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, such as liver disease, could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and risk factors for infection, such as catheters and tubes, could lead to infection, which could be life-threatening."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today, 100
   TID [**11-30**] with dilantin level in [**11-30**] am.
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, add back low dose
   propofol if necessary.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, UA and urine cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   extubation tomorrow AM after studies & seizures under control.
   - titrate vent by ABGs
   - wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if possible
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Trend in AM.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs in the
   AM (2 sets 12 hours apart).
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. (diet at facility no potatoes, tomatoes, oranges,
   or bananas due to renal disease). replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: hep sc tid, BM reg, ISS
   .
   #Access: R fem line, R wrist PIV, R antecub PIV. IF BP stable overnight
   d/c fem line in am.
   .
   # CODE: full code, confirmed with patient's wife who is hcp
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4086**] is HCP, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4087**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today, 100
   TID [**11-30**] with dilantin level in [**11-30**] am.
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, add back low dose
   propofol if necessary.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, UA and urine cultures
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   extubation tomorrow AM after studies & seizures under control.
   - titrate vent by ABGs
   - wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if possible
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Trend in AM.
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   - continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo
   .
   # Type 2 DM: Not hypoglycemic currently. HISS.
   .
   # Anemia: Hct near recent baseline. Has active T&S. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Near baseline. Continue to trend.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hypotensive with propofol, increasing as sedation
   weaned. Holding Metoprolol, nifedipine, diovan, imdur for now, add back
   as sedation titrated and BP allows.
   .
   #CAD: continue ASA and Statin. No acute EKG changes. Repeat CEs in the
   AM (2 sets 12 hours apart).

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of right focal motor seizures, carotid endarterectomy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who was admitted to the ICU with seizures, respiratory failure, and lactic acidosis. He has a history of focal seizures and was on Dilantin in the past. He was intubated for airway protection and is being treated with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and sedatives. His laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, mildly elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and normal electrolyte levels. He has a history of chronic hypodensities on CT head and is being evaluated for stroke.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures and is still experiencing seizure activity, which may lead to further complications, such as status epilepticus.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, which can lead to acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for developing infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or meningitis.
5. Stroke: The patient's history of carotid endarterectomy and chronic hypodensities on CT head make him at risk for developing a stroke, which can lead to severe neurological complications.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, which can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
8. Diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels are not well-controlled, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticonvulsant therapy and monitor the patient's seizure activity closely.
2. Wean sedation gradually and titrate ventilation based on ABG results.
3. Monitor the patient's lactic acid levels and consider treating with lactate-lowering agents if necessary.
4. Continue antibiotics and antiviral therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if necessary.
6. Control the patient's blood pressure and consider adding antihypertensive medications if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and consider adjusting insulin therapy if necessary.
8. Consider imaging studies, such as MRI/MRA, to evaluate for stroke or other neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old man who underwent recent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to seizures with status and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes and creatinine. His blood glucose level is 134 mg/dL, and his calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, normal heart sounds, and clear breath sounds. He is lethargic but arousable, with absent peripheral pulses and diminished deep tendon reflexes. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of seizure status, respiratory failure, and renal failure, as well as antibiotic management pending HSV PCR results. The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, and cough, and will be attempted to be extubated once the MRI is completed. 

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further, leading to increased oxygen requirements or the need for more aggressive respiratory support.

2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure status may worsen, leading to increased risk of brain injury or death.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, leading to the need for more aggressive renal replacement therapy or dialysis.

4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate, leading to arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.

5. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised, leading to increased risk of infection, including central nervous system (CNS) infection.

6. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to his anticoagulation therapy, which may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial bleeding.

7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may deteriorate, leading to nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may continue to deteriorate, leading to increased risk of brain injury, stroke, or death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour progress note from the ICU. The patient received antibiotics, including vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone, which were discontinued. A head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient was extubated successfully and restarted on lopressor and nifedipine for hypertension. Free dilantin levels are expected to be back between 6-7 am. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/60 mmHg. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation, with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine, glucose, and lactate levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure, or cerebrovascular events.
2. Seizure: The patient had a seizure with status epilepticus, which may lead to further seizures or neurological complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation, which may lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or airway obstruction.
5. Infection: The patient received antibiotics, which were discontinued, which may lead to infection or sepsis.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, which may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unknown due to the lack of assessment, which may lead to further neurological complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is unknown, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 78 y/o man with PMH notable for Hx of R focal seizures with
   hyperperfusion syndrome, CAD s/p CABG, recent carotid endarterectomy,
   and type 2 DM admitted with seizures X 3 earlier today.
   .
   # Seizures: the patient does have a history of right focal motor
   seizures following his first carotid endarterectomy in [**2172**] and was on
   dilantin for a period of time (unclear for how long). He apparently
   never had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at that time. For this
   episodes, differential includes infectious, stroke, toxic metabolic,
   and primary seizure disorder. No acute hemmorrhage on CT head, multiple
   hypodensities sound chronic. No hypoglycemia, electrolytes WNL. CSF
   with mild elevated protein, NL glucose, no WBC/RBC. Lactate 10 on
   admission likely [**1-29**] seizure, 1 on repeat on arrival to the ICU.
   - MRI/MRA brain and neck to eval for CVA
   - neuro recs appreciated
   - Covered with Vanco, CTX, AMP, acyclovir. CSF only showed mild
   elevation of protein (ddx: Viral, lyme, and neurosyphilis). Can now d/c
   Vanco, CTX, AMP. Continue Acyclovir pending HSV pcr result .
   - EEG monitoring overnight (in progress)
   - Dilantin loaded in ED, additional 500mg in divided doses today,
   Dilatin level 7.8 this am given additional 300mg x1, to get 100 TID
   [**11-30**]. Dilatin level and free dilatin ([**1-29**] renal failure) to be
   collected 1 hr after 300mg dose this am
   - seizure precautions
   - d/c fentanyl and versed as soon as possible, wean  low dose propofol
   as tolerated.
   - pt is on bualbital-APAP-Caffeine which can cause withdraw seizures if
   suddenly stoped, however as per nursing home notes has not been
   consistantly getting med.
   - f/u CSF, and urine cultures
   - Vascular suggest transcranial Doppler to r/o reperfusion syndrome
   non-emergently after MR, EEG. Talk to rads have no equipment to do
   test. Need to contact neuro to see if they do test.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in ED. Likely
   today  after MR studies & seizures under control.
   -          wean sedation in AM if possible with RSBI and SBT if
   possible
   -          called by rads, ET tube against R tracheal wall, balloon
   hyperinflated, respiratory to adjust

   # Lactic acidosis: Resolved on repeat ABG on arrival to the ICU.
   .
   # Transaminitis: ? etiology. Stable this AM. Continue to trend
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Renal consulted and appreciate their recs. Plan for HD
   tomorrow.
   -          continue nephrocaps, calcitriol, and Phoslo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of right focal seizures, CAD, and type 2 DM, admitted with seizures three times earlier today. He was intubated for airway protection in the ED and was found to have mild elevated protein in his CSF. He was started on antibiotics, antiviral medication, and has had multiple imaging studies, including a CT head and MRI/MRA brain and neck. His seizures have been controlled, and he is currently extubated. He has been experiencing hypertension, which is being managed with medication. He has also been experiencing lactic acidosis, which has resolved. He has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis, which are being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures and is still receiving anticonvulsant medication. There is a risk of seizure recurrence, especially if the medication is not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient has been started on antibiotics, but there is still a risk of infection, particularly if the patient has a compromised immune system.
3. Stroke or CVA: The patient has had multiple imaging studies, but there is still a risk of stroke or CVA, especially if the patient has a history of hyperperfusion syndrome.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
5. Lactic acidosis: The patient has had lactic acidosis in the past and may be at risk for it again if his respiratory status deteriorates or if he has a metabolic disorder.
6. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or may be a side effect of medication.
7. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or may be a side effect of medication.
8. ESRD on HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis, which may increase his risk of complications such as infection and cardiovascular disease.
9. Type 2 DM: The patient has type 2 DM, which may increase his risk of complications such as cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust medication as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's lactic acidosis and adjust medication as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia and adjust medication as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hypertension and adjust medication as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's ESRD on HD and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's type 2 DM and adjust treatment as needed.
8. Consider ordering additional imaging studies to rule out stroke or CVA.
9. Consider ordering additional laboratory tests to rule out infection or other underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 78-year-old man with a history of right focal seizures, CAD, and type 2 DM, was admitted with seizures and was found to have no ICH on a final read head CT. He was extubated successfully and is currently on room air. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/60 mmHg. He is receiving prophylactic heparin and is being monitored for respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: Given the patient's history of seizures and the possibility of CVA and reperfusion syndrome, there is a risk of seizure recurrence. Close monitoring and adjustment of anticonvulsant therapy as needed are essential.
2. Neurological deficits: The patient's confusion, word-finding difficulty, and difficulty following commands may be indicative of ongoing neurological deficits. Further evaluation and management by neurology services are necessary.
3. Respiratory complications: Although the patient was extubated successfully, there is still a risk of respiratory complications, particularly in the setting of possible CVA and reperfusion syndrome.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent carotid endarterectomy may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Infection: The patient's history of seizures and recent carotid endarterectomy may increase his risk of infection, particularly in the setting of possible CVA and reperfusion syndrome.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of type 2 DM and recent carotid endarterectomy may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Renal complications: The patient's history of ESRD on HD and recent carotid endarterectomy may increase his risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with a seizure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has remained stable, with no further seizures reported. However, he remains disoriented and confabulating. The patient's neurologic diagnosis is tentatively diagnosed as PRES (Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) due to hyperperfusion after a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The patient's blood pressure is currently in the range of 140-150 mmHg, which is being monitored and managed without further antihypertensive medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 50% and is being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's respiratory support is being monitored and adjusted as needed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, CK, and CKMB, indicating cardiac injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 6.7 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's seizure disorder is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further seizures.
2. Neurologic complications: The patient's PRES diagnosis is a concern, and there is a risk of further neurologic complications, such as cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac injury may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's impaired renal function may lead to further complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support is being closely monitored, and there is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly given his impaired immune function and prolonged hospital stay.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, and there is a risk of malnutrition or dehydration if not properly managed.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing a DVT, particularly given his prolonged immobility and impaired renal function."
