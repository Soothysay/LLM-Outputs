You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, and cerebrovascular accident. He presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 3-vessel disease. He received a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent and has been chest pain-free since.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving amiodarone for ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) and is being monitored for cardiac rhythm. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with aggatroban, which has been held due to bleeding risk.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 112/61 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating ongoing myocardial damage. His kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 9.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of chronic skin changes on his lower extremities and is currently experiencing an ulceration on his left anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and he may be at risk for further cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and he may be at risk for further decline in kidney function or acute kidney injury.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy and may require further monitoring and adjustments to his anticoagulation regimen.
4. Wound complications: The patient's left leg ulcer may become infected or develop further complications, such as gangrene or sepsis.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's hyperthyroidism may require further evaluation and management, and his hypercholesterolemia may require further treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA) who presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have 3-vessel disease, which was treated with a Left Anterior Descending (LAD) bare metal stent. He is currently on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no further episodes of chest pain or diaphoresis. He is on amiodarone infusion for atrial fibrillation, which is being discontinued due to non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry. He is also on heparin therapy for anticoagulation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding risk: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including hemodialysis and cardiac catheterization. He is at risk for bleeding due to his medication regimen, including aspirin, beta-blocker, and heparin.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, CVA, and STEMI, which puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis, which puts him at risk for complications such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.
4. Wound complications: The patient has a chronic left leg ulcer, which may be at risk for infection, necrosis, or further deterioration.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient has hyperthyroidism and may be at risk for metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of COPD and may be at risk for pulmonary complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and pulmonary embolism.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of poor PO intake and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA). He was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have 3-vessel disease, for which he received a Left Anterior Descending (LAD) BMS stent.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), blood pressure 97/47 mmHg, heart rate 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 8.3 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL, creatinine 9.4 mg/dL, and troponin T 19.1 ng/mL.
* Physical examination: The patient is somnolent but otherwise well-appearing, with a palpable thrill and audible bruit in the left arm, and a positive stool guaiac test.
* Medical history: The patient has a history of CAD, hypercholesterolemia, and a previous CVA, and is currently on hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is elevated, and he has a positive stool guaiac test, which may indicate a gastrointestinal source of infection.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to his history of CAD and recent surgery.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92%, and he has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular fibrillation and is currently on telemetry monitoring.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is on hemodialysis.
6. Wound infection: The patient has a chronic left leg ulcer and is at risk for wound infection.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is experiencing weight loss due to poor oral intake, which may lead to malnutrition.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and he is at risk for electrolyte imbalance due to his history of CAD and recent surgery.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU."

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 27-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a left ventricular cavity enlargement and extensive regional systolic dysfunction. The patient is undergoing cardiac catheterization and is expected to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial infarction. The patient's creatinine level is 9.4 mg/dL, indicating chronic renal failure. The patient's white blood cell count is 8.3, and platelet count is 160, indicating possible infection.

The patient's medical history includes a recent episode of hypoxia and shortness of breath, which was treated with oxygen therapy and morphine. The patient's wound is showing signs of infection, with a positive guaiac test for stool.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Alteration in nutrition
* Knowledge deficit
* Renal failure, chronic
* Impaired skin integrity
* Altered mental status
* Myocardial infarction, acute

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis due to the positive guaiac test for stool
* Worsening of chronic renal failure
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to the ongoing myocardial infarction
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's platelet count
* Potential for further cardiovascular complications due to the patient's CAD and recent myocardial infarction.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and wound status closely. The patient's medical team should also consider adjusting their treatment plan to address the patient's potential medical complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 27-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition has been complicated by:

1. Renal failure, chronic (CRF): The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated, and he is on hemodialysis.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has an ulceration on his left anterior skin with eschar and granulation tissue, and chronic skin changes of bilateral lower extremities c/w statis dermatitis.
3. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient is somnolent but otherwise well-appearing, with no signs of delirium.
4. Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI): The patient has had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with extensive regional systolic dysfunction and mild aortic regurgitation.
5. Hypoxia: The patient has had an episode of hypoxia/SOB, with a SpO2 of 92%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he is receiving oxygen therapy. However, he may be at risk for respiratory failure due to his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac status is complex, and he is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and is at risk for infection, particularly sepsis.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has an ulceration on his left anterior skin, which may be at risk for bleeding and hemorrhagic complications.
5. Renal failure progression: The patient's renal function is already impaired, and he may be at risk for further decline in renal function, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Heparin sodium infusion for anticoagulation
2. Morphine sulfate for pain management
3. Nebulized medications for bronchodilation
4. Nitroglycerin for cardiac ischemia
5. Antibiotics for infection prophylaxis
6. Glycemic control measures to manage blood glucose levels
7. Renal replacement therapy for hemodialysis
8. Wound care and management for the ulceration on his left anterior skin

The patient's current vital signs are:

1. Temperature: 38.4°C (101.1°F)
2. Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
3. Blood pressure: 97/47 mmHg
4. Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
5. SpO2: 92%

The patient's laboratory results are:

1. Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
2. White blood cell count: 8.3 K/uL
3. Creatinine: 9.4 mg/dL
4. Troponin-T: 19.10 ng/mL
5. Glucose: 102 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

1. Chronic kidney disease
2. Myocardial infarction
3. Appendectomy
4. Statis dermatitis

The patient's family history is not mentioned in the progress note.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), which was treated with cardiac catheterization and placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent.

The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is being treated with heparin, morphine, and nitroglycerin for chest pain and pulmonary hypertension. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 97/47 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial damage. His creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. His complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 8.3 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 160 x 10^9/L.

The patient's medical history includes a history of CAD, hypercholesterolemia, and CVA, which may be contributing factors to his current condition. He is also taking medications for his conditions, including aspirin, beta-blockers, and statins.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing myocardial damage may lead to further complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient's renal dysfunction may worsen, leading to further complications, such as acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
3. Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase his risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematoma.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and CVA may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, it is recommended that he be closely monitored in the ICU and that his medications be adjusted as necessary to manage his symptoms and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a recent STEMI from out-of-hospital (OSH) with a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) with hematochezia, bradybradypnea, and melena, which was likely caused by watershed ischemia. He was given 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. His laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing cardiac injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing GIB and bradypnea may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac injury may progress, leading to further cardiac damage, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's wheezing may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Infection complications: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase his risk of developing infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or wound infections.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's poor oral intake may worsen, leading to malnutrition, weight loss, and potential complications such as pressure ulcers.
7. Wound complications: The patient's chronic left leg ulcer may worsen, leading to increased risk of infection, dehiscence, or gangrene.

Recommendations:

1. Continue pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding complications closely and consider transfusing additional PRBC if necessary.
3. Continue cardiac medications, including aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin, as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and troponin-T levels closely to assess for further cardiac injury.
5. Continue dialysis as scheduled and monitor the patient's renal function closely.
6. Consider consultation with wound care specialists to optimize management of the patient's chronic left leg ulcer.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider nebulization therapy as needed.
8. Consider consultation with infectious disease specialists to assess the patient's risk of developing infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had a mix of BRBPR and dark
   stool concerning for melena yesterday.  His Hct dropped from 30 to 26
   and only rose to 29.4 with 2 units of blood.  He continues to have
   slight oozing of dark stool today.  GI evaluated the patient and felt
   his GI bleed was very likely from a lower GI source such as bowel
   ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer (especially given his
   recent 100 lb weight loss).  GI feels the patient is at very high risk
   for both colonoscopy or EGD.  The patient
s SBP have been low in the
   80
s to 100
s, however he has remained Hemodynamically stable, making a
   brisk UGIB unlikely.  The heparin gtt was stopped yesterday when he
   started to bleed.
   -  Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   -  Patient will go for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
   possible causes of LGIB.
   -  Will check Hct q6h and transfuse for Hct < 30 given recent ischemia.
   -  Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort two
   days ago at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   - Given his recent GI bleed, unlikely to go for CABG in the near future
   (as this would require a heparin bolus).
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - After discussion on rounds today, it was decided to restart him on
   Plavix (as the heparin gtt was stopped) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - Can consider stenting the LAD instead of CABG depending on the cause
   of his bleed and how long it lasts.
   .
   # PUMP: Echo with LVEF 25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum
   and anterior walls, distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and
   dyskinetic and remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart once his
   pressures become more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.
   - continue to monitor on tele

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and a recent STEMI from out-of-hospital (OSH). He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the obtuse marginal branch (OM1) and mid-left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient has been experiencing a mix of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and melena, which is suspected to be a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, possibly due to bowel ischemia, diverticulosis, or cancer. His hemoglobin (Hct) level has dropped from 30.4 to 26.1, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). He continues to have a slow leakage of dark maroonish stool.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure (BP) ranging from 80-100 mmHg, and a heart rate (HR) of 73 beats per minute (bpm). His respiratory rate (RR) is 20 inspirations per minute (IPM), and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including CAD, and has undergone PCI to the LAD artery. He has also had an episode of ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) at OSH, which resolved with shock.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatinine (Cr), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which may indicate cardiac or renal injury. His white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated, and his platelet count is normal.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. GI bleed: The patient's ongoing GI bleed may lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, PCI, and STEMI puts him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD on HD may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's history of CVA and his current GI bleed may increase his risk for infectious complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and sepsis.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's poor oral intake may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleed and transfuse PRBC as needed to maintain a Hct level above 30.
2. Restart heparin therapy once the patient's GI bleed has resolved and his BP is stable.
3. Consider stenting the LAD artery instead of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if the patient's bleed persists.
4. Continue cardiac medications, including aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his HD schedule as needed.
6. Provide wound care for the patient's left leg ulcer.
7. Consider a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for possible causes of the patient's GI bleed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had a mix of BRBPR and dark
   stool concerning for melena yesterday.  His Hct dropped from 30 to 26
   and only rose to 29.4 with 2 units of blood.  He continues to have
   slight oozing of dark stool today.  GI evaluated the patient and felt
   his GI bleed was very likely from a lower GI source such as bowel
   ischemia, diverticulosis, or possibly cancer (especially given his
   recent 100 lb weight loss).  GI feels the patient is at very high risk
   for both colonoscopy or EGD.  The patient
s SBP have been low in the
   80
s to 100
s, however he has remained Hemodynamically stable, making a
   brisk UGIB unlikely.  The heparin gtt was stopped yesterday when he
   started to bleed.
   -  Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   -  Patient will go for a CT torso with contrast to evaluate for
   possible causes of LGIB.
   -  Will check Hct q6h and transfuse for Hct < 30 given recent ischemia.
   -  Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort two
   days ago at dialysis, possibly flash pulmonary edema.
   - Given his recent GI bleed, unlikely to go for CABG in the near future
   (as this would require a heparin bolus).
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - After discussion on rounds today, it was decided to restart him on
   Plavix (as the heparin gtt was stopped) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - Can consider stenting the LAD instead of CABG depending on the cause
   of his bleed and how long it lasts.
   .
   # PUMP: Echo with LVEF 25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum
   and anterior walls, distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and
   dyskinetic and remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart once his
   pressures become more stable
   .
   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a recent Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He was admitted with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent. He has since developed a gastrointestinal bleed, which is suspected to be due to a lower gastrointestinal source such as bowel ischemia, diverticulosis, or cancer. The patient is at high risk for colonoscopy or endoscopy, and a CT torso with contrast has been ordered to evaluate the cause of the bleed. The patient's platelet count is abnormal, and he is on Plavix to prevent stent thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed is a significant concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and optimal management.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient's CAD is a risk factor for future cardiac events, and his recent STEMI has increased his risk of cardiac complications.
3. End-stage renal disease: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and his recent weight loss and gastrointestinal bleed may be related to his underlying kidney disease.
4. Chronic skin changes: The patient's chronic skin changes, including ulcers on his left leg, may be a source of infection and require wound care management.
5. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient's hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and his recent cardiac events may be related to his lipid profile.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's recent weight loss and gastrointestinal bleed may be related to hypothyroidism, and his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal.
7. Malignancy: The patient's recent weight loss and gastrointestinal bleed may be related to underlying malignancy, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his symptoms.

Recommendations:

1. Continue Plavix to prevent stent thrombosis.
2. Order a CT torso with contrast to evaluate the cause of the gastrointestinal bleed.
3. Consider colonoscopy or endoscopy to evaluate the gastrointestinal tract and determine the cause of the bleed.
4. Continue hemodialysis as prescribed.
5. Manage the patient's chronic skin changes with wound care and antibiotic therapy as needed.
6. Consider further evaluation for underlying malignancy, including colonoscopy and imaging studies.
7. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 64-year-old male, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a history of Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA). He was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent.

The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely related to a carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction, as evidenced by a CT scan. He has been started on Plavix, and NPO status has been ordered for a flexible sigmoidoscopy to obtain tissue diagnosis.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. He is on aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy, and has been restarted on Plavix due to his high risk of in-stent thrombosis.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with wheezing on examination, and is being managed with PRN nebulizers. His renal status is stable, with ongoing hemodialysis three times a week.

The patient's wound care is a concern, with a chronic left leg ulcer, and a wound care consult has been ordered. His electrolyte levels are being monitored, and he is on a cardiac, renal diet with repletion of lytes as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding is a concern, and further diagnostic tests are needed to determine the cause and extent of the bleeding.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD, STEMI, and cardiac catheterization with stent placement puts him at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stent thrombosis.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD on hemodialysis requires careful monitoring of his renal function, and he is at risk for complications such as acute kidney injury, sepsis, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Wound complications: The patient's chronic left leg ulcer requires careful wound care and monitoring to prevent further complications, such as infection, necrosis, and amputation.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's wheezing on examination suggests underlying respiratory disease, and he is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple comorbidities to prevent complications and improve his clinical outcome."

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and STEMI, and was transferred to the ICU for cardiac catheterization. He underwent a LAD BMS stent placement with 3v disease. The patient had a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which was likely caused by a carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction. He is currently on aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and Plavix.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Gastrointestinal Bleed:** The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleed is a significant concern, and it is essential to monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. The patient's carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction may require further treatment, and the patient's bleeding may worsen if left untreated.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's 3v disease and recent STEMI increase his risk of cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and recurrent myocardial infarction.
3. **Renal Complications:** The patient's ESRD on hemodialysis increases his risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.
4. **Infection:** The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleed and his history of CVA increase his risk of infection, including sepsis and pneumonia.
5. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's wheezing on examination suggests underlying pulmonary disease, which may worsen with respiratory infections or cardiac complications.
6. **Wound Complications:** The patient's chronic left leg ulcer requires ongoing wound care and monitoring to prevent infection and further complications.
7. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's history of ESRD and recent gastrointestinal bleed increase his risk of electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.
8. **Hepatic Complications:** The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and recent STEMI increase his risk of hepatic complications, including liver dysfunction and cholestasis.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleed and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Continue aspirin, beta-blocker, statin, and Plavix to manage cardiac risk factors.
3. Continue dialysis three times a week and monitor for signs of acute kidney injury.
4. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic treatment as necessary.
5. Continue wound care for the patient's chronic left leg ulcer.
6. Monitor for electrolyte imbalances and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust treatment as necessary."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have 3-vessel disease, for which he received a left anterior descending (LAD) bare metal stent. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and was found to have a carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and is being treated with aspirin, beta blockers, statins, and Plavix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant concern, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and STEMI increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and ongoing dialysis increase his risk of acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and ongoing dialysis increase his risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and wheezing on examination increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
6. Skin complications: The patient's chronic skin changes and left leg ulcer increase his risk of skin infections, wound complications, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CVA and ongoing CAD increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), and was treated with a Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Bare Metal Stent (BMS) during cardiac catheterization.

The patient has been experiencing a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which was initially suspected to be caused by a tumor at the rectosigmoid junction, but subsequent flexible sigmoidoscopy showed only erythema and no mass. The patient's hemoglobin level has stabilized at 32%, and there has been no further passage of bloody stools.

The patient's coronary arteries are diseased, with 3-vessel disease, and he is awaiting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). He has been experiencing chest discomfort with dialysis, but none since the stent was placed.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, and has been experiencing mild aneurysm and dyskinesis of the apex. He has also had episodes of ventricular fibrillation, but has been in normal sinus rhythm since the shock.

The patient has a chronic left leg ulcer and is on dialysis three times a week. He has a history of COPD and is wheezing on examination.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's recent lower gastrointestinal bleed may recur, especially if he experiences further episodes of ischemia.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient's 3-vessel disease and history of STEMI make him at high risk for further coronary artery events, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac death.
3. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen over time, leading to decreased cardiac function and increased risk of cardiac death.
4. Ventricular fibrillation: The patient's history of ventricular fibrillation may recur, especially if he experiences further episodes of cardiac stress or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's ESRD may worsen over time, leading to further kidney damage and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. COPD: The patient's COPD may worsen over time, leading to increased respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function.
7. Left leg ulcer: The patient's chronic left leg ulcer may worsen over time, leading to increased risk of infection and amputation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve his overall health."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and placement of a left anterior descending (LAD) bare-metal stent.

The patient has been experiencing a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which was initially suspected to be due to heparin therapy, but was later determined to be secondary to ischemia. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 32%, and he is no longer experiencing further passage of bloody stools.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30%. He has also experienced episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VT) in the past, but has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since admission.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97%. He is receiving oxygen therapy via a non-invasive delivery device, and his ABG results are within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.6, hemoglobin (Hct) of 32%, and platelet count (Plt) of 187. His creatinine (Cr) level is 8.0 mg/dL, and his troponin-T level is 23.80 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, STEMI, and VT, and is at risk for further cardiac events, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has experienced a lower gastrointestinal bleed, and may be at risk for further bleeding or perforation.
3. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD on hemodialysis, and may be at risk for further decline in renal function or development of acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has COPD and is at risk for respiratory failure or exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
5. Skin complications: The patient has a chronic skin ulcer on his left leg, which may be at risk for further infection or deterioration.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, and is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his condition is essential to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and a previous Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). He presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), underwent cardiac catheterization, and received a Left Anterior Descending (LAD) Bare Metal Stent (BMS). He also had a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which was attributed to ischemia and has since stabilized. The patient is awaiting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) and is being managed for cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal issues.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** Although the patient's bleeding has stabilized, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding, especially if the underlying cause is not fully addressed. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent future bleeding episodes.
2. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's cardiac condition is complex, with a history of CAD, STEMI, and a recent episode of chest discomfort during dialysis. He is at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications.
3. **Renal Complications:** The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis, and close monitoring of his renal function to prevent complications such as acute kidney injury or worsening of his underlying renal disease.
4. **Neurological Complications:** The patient's history of CVA and recent episode of ventricular fibrillation (VF) place him at risk for neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or cognitive decline. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications.
5. **Infection:** The patient's immunocompromised state due to his ESRD and recent hospitalization increases his risk of infection. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of any suspected infections are necessary to prevent complications.
6. **Wound Complications:** The patient's left leg ulcer appears chronic and requires ongoing wound care and management to prevent complications such as infection, dehiscence, or delayed healing.
7. **Medication-Related Complications:** The patient is taking multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers, which may increase his risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, or cardiac complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications.

Overall, the patient requires ongoing close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Significant atherosclerotic disease involving the carotid arteries

   the
   right and approximately 80-85%% stenosis over a short segment in the
   proximal
   left cervical internal carotid artery. No flow limitation distally.
   Assessment and Plan
   64yo M with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD, hypercholesterolemia, CVA p/w chest
   pain and STEMI, v. fib X 3 at OSH, resolved with shock, transferred
   from OSH for cardiac cath, now s/p LAD BMS stent with 3v disease while
   awaiting CABG had a lower GI bleed.
   .
   # GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Pt started to have GI bleed when heparin was
   started.  CT scan showed thickening at rectosigmoid junction concerning
   for cancer, however a flex sig yesterday by GI showed no mass and only
   erythema at the recto-sigmoid junction which was likely secondary to
   ischemia.  Hct is stable at 32 today and no further passage of bloody
   stools.  Pt
s daughter reports that he had colonoscopy within the last
   3 months which did not show etiology of bleed.
   - Daily HCT
   - Active type and screen, 2 PIV
   - will need outpatient colonoscopy and further evaluation as inpatient
   if pt starts to bleed again
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Pt with hx of CAD, p/w STEMI and cath showing 3v
   disease, s/p BMS stent to LAD.  Had episode of chest discomfort with
   dialysis on [**2110-11-10**], none since.
   - As the patient is no longer having a GI bleed and its origin was from
   ischemia, the patient can likely have his CABG next week.
   - Continue aspirin, bblocker, statin
   - Continue on Plavix (started [**2110-11-12**]) due to his high risk of instent
   thrombosus when on ASA alone.
   - will need to discuss with CT surgery regarding potential stent to
   carotids given CT findings
   .
   # PUMP: Patient with chronic systolic heart failure - Echo with LVEF
   25-30%, with near akinesis of distal
 of septum and anterior walls,
   distal inferior wall.  Apex mildly aneursymal and dyskinetic and
   remaining segments contract normally.
   - Continue bblocker and statin
   - no ACE given his recent hypotension, but would restart after CABG.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  S/P v. fib X 3 at OSH with shock X 3. Has been in NSR since
   without episodes of VT on telemetry.
   - continue to monitor on tele
   .
   # ESRD on HD: unclear origin of disease.  Pt dialyzed M, W, F.
   - continue dialysis M, W, F
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue Sevelamer, Nephrocaps
   .
   # COPD: pt wheezing on exam
   - PRN nebs
   .
   # Left leg ulcer: appears chronic
   - wound care consult

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and Hypercholesterolemia, who presented with chest pain and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). He underwent cardiac catheterization, placement of a Left Anterior Descending (LAD) BMS stent, and is awaiting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). The patient had a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which was likely secondary to ischemia, and is currently stable with a hematocrit (HCT) of 32.

The patient has a significant atherosclerotic disease involving the carotid arteries, with 50% stenosis in the proximal cervical internal carotid artery on the right and approximately 80-85% stenosis in the proximal left cervical internal carotid artery.

The patient has a history of Chronic Systolic Heart Failure with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, and is on medications for cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is likely secondary to ischemia, but there is a risk of recurrence. Close monitoring of stool output and HCT is necessary.
2. Complications related to carotid artery stenosis: The patient's significant atherosclerotic disease involving the carotid arteries may increase the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Close monitoring of neurological symptoms and consideration of stenting or carotid endarterectomy may be necessary.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, STEMI, and chronic systolic heart failure, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of cardiac function and medication adjustments as necessary.
4. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD on hemodialysis, which increases the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and medication adjustments as necessary.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies is necessary.
6. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk of thrombosis due to his history of CAD, STEMI, and placement of a BMS stent. Close monitoring of laboratory results and imaging studies is necessary to detect any signs of thrombosis.
7. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of CAD, STEMI, and chronic systolic heart failure, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Close monitoring of cardiac function and medication adjustments as necessary."
