 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   63 year old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia,
   hypoglycemia, without obvious source of infection, in guarded
   condition.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC: Although septic shock is most likely etiology, other
   considerations include myxedema coma, adrenal insufficiency, profound
   hypovolemia or hemodynamic process. In light of prior presentations
   with unexplained hypotension, will maintain broad differential.
   Initial Infectious workup remarkable for a positive UA and history of
   entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray unremarkable, no meningeal symptoms
   although mental status is altered. Other possible sources include
   surgical site at Right BKA and left foot ulcers. Would also consider
   expansin of fistula from uterus to
   -- Broad spectrum antibiotics; Vancomycin given multiple recent
   hospitalizations and Zosyn given concern for gram negatives, anaerobes
   and pseudomonas in this diabetic.
   -- Volume resusitate, CVP to 16 per early goal directed therapy
   -- No need for transusion at this time
   -- F/U Blood, urine cultures
   -- Consider dedicated fungal cultures
   -- Add baseline cortisol, would consider dexamethasone if refractory
   hypotension
 HYPOTHERMIA: Unclear etiology in this female with history of CVA, now
   with recurrent presentations of very low core temperature. Would favor
   a central process with temperature disregulation, however important
   etiologies to evaluate for include sepsis, adrenal insufficiency and
   myxedema coma. Patient however has been evaluated in prior admission
   and only has a low normal TSH and normal cortisol.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: Unclear etiology from prior admissions,
   suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process.
   -- Avoid H2 blockers, meds that could cause thrombocytopenia
   -- Recent HIT antibody negative, would not re check
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 2.3. Given hypotension, suspect this most
   likely represents pre-renal azotemia, however differential diagnosis
   includes post renal and intrinsic process
   -- Urine culture
   -- Urine lytes
   -- Empiric fluids
   -- Renal ultrasound
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Although baseline is very
   limited, per daughter patient less interactive than at baseline.
   Suspect this is likely to systemic process
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Very low bicarbonate on admission, lactate
   however was normal. No anion gap. Most likely this represents GI losses
   vs decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function.
   -- Fluid resusitation
   -- Would use LR / D5
 NS with Bicarb as IV fluid
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS: Continue Keppra 500mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. The patient is in a guarded condition.

The patient has a history of recurrent unexplained hypotension, and the initial infectious workup is remarkable for a positive urine analysis and history of an entero-uterine fistula. The patient also has a history of a right below-knee amputation (BKA) and left foot ulcers.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypothermia with an unclear etiology
* Septic shock with a broad differential diagnosis, including myxedema coma, adrenal insufficiency, profound hypovolemia, or a hemodynamic process
* Acute thrombocytopenia with an unclear etiology, suspecting bone marrow suppression or a consumptive process
* Acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.1-1.3 and a current creatinine of 2.3, suspecting pre-renal azotemia but also considering post-renal and intrinsic processes
* Altered mental status with a limited baseline, suspecting a systemic process
* Metabolic acidosis with a very low bicarbonate level on admission, likely representing GI losses or decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function
* History of seizure without status epilepticus

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn, and is being treated with volume resuscitation, CVP to 16, and empiric fluids. The patient is also being monitored for blood and urine cultures, and consideration is being given to dedicated fungal cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Continued septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction
* Worsening of acute renal failure
* Development of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Development of metabolic acidosis or respiratory acidosis
* Increased risk of seizure recurrence
* Development of complications from the entero-uterine fistula, such as peritonitis or abscesses
* Development of complications from the right BKA and left foot ulcers, such as infection or gangrene."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia,
   hypoglycemia, without obvious source of infection, in guarded
   condition.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC: Initial Infectious workup remarkable for a positive UA
   and history of entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray unremarkable, no
   meningeal symptoms although mental status is altered. Other possible
   sources include Right BKA and left foot ulcers.
   -- Broad spectrum antibiotics; Vancomycin given multiple recent
   hospitalizations and Zosyn given concern for gram negatives, anaerobes
   and pseudomonas in this diabetic.
   -- IVF with CVP goal of 8
   -- Transfused two u pRBCs overnight
   -- F/U Blood, urine cultures
   -- [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test with appropriate rise in cortisol so adrenal
   insufficiency less likely
 HYPOTHERMIA: Ddx includes sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia and
   intracranial pathology.
   -- Intracranial pathology less likely as hypothermia resolved with
   rewarming
   -- Sepsis work up as above
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE, Anemia:  Unclear etiology from prior
   admissions, suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process.
   -- No recent heparin, no other drugs on board likely to cause new
   thrombocytopenia, no new drugs
   -- Heme onc consult re: anemia and thrombocytopenia
   -- Send folate, B12, iron studies in the setting of chronic
   malabsorption and e/o pernicious anemia on EGD
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 1.9 (down from 2.3 on admission). Given
   hypotension, suspect this most likely represents pre-renal azotemia,
   however differential diagnosis includes post renal and intrinsic
   process
   -- Urine culture
   -- Urine lytes
   -- Empiric fluids
   -- Renal ultrasound
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Although baseline is very
   limited, per daughter patient less interactive than at baseline.
   Suspect this is likely to systemic process
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Very low bicarbonate on admission, lactate
   however was normal. No anion gap. Most likely this represents GI losses
   vs decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function.
   -- Fluid resusitation
   -- Would use LR / D5
 NS with Bicarb as IV fluid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a guarded condition, presenting with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She has a history of entero-uterine fistula, Right BKA, and left foot ulcers. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been transfused with two units of packed red blood cells overnight. She has acute thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure, and is being treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, and hemodynamic monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia, sepsis is a possibility. The infectious workup is ongoing, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 47 K/uL, which is low. The etiology is unclear, but it may be due to bone marrow suppression or a consumptive process.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, post-renal process, and intrinsic renal disease.
4. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, with a very low bicarbonate level. This may be due to GI losses or decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal failure.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to a systemic process or intracranial pathology.
6. Hypothermia: The patient has hypothermia, which may be due to sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia, or intracranial pathology.
7. Seizure Activity: The patient has a history of seizure activity, and is receiving Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
8. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic complications, particularly DVT and PE, given her history of immobility and thrombocytopenia.
9. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the setting of her underlying medical conditions and immunosuppression.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO, which may lead to malnutrition and further compromise her immune function.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple potential complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration and optimize her outcome."

 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   63 year old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia,
   hypoglycemia, without obvious source of infection, in guarded
   condition.
 SHOCK, SEPTIC: Initial Infectious workup remarkable for a positive UA
   and history of entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray unremarkable, no
   meningeal symptoms although mental status is altered. Other possible
   sources include surgical site at Right BKA and left foot ulcers.
   -- Broad spectrum antibiotics; Vancomycin given multiple recent
   hospitalizations and Zosyn given concern for gram negatives, anaerobes
   and pseudomonas in this diabetic.
   -- Volume resusitate, CVP goal of 8
   -- Transfused two u pRBCs overnight
   -- F/U Blood, urine cultures
   -- [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test with appropriate rise in cortisol so adrenal
   insufficiency less likely
 HYPOTHERMIA: Ddx includes sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia and
   intracranial pathology.
   -- Intracranial pathology less likely as hypothermia resolved with
   rewarming
   -- Sepsis work up as above
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: Unclear etiology from prior admissions,
   suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process.
   -- No recent heparin
   --
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 2.3. Given hypotension, suspect this most
   likely represents pre-renal azotemia, however differential diagnosis
   includes post renal and intrinsic process
   -- Urine culture
   -- Urine lytes
   -- Empiric fluids
   -- Renal ultrasound
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Although baseline is very
   limited, per daughter patient less interactive than at baseline.
   Suspect this is likely to systemic process
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Very low bicarbonate on admission, lactate
   however was normal. No anion gap. Most likely this represents GI losses
   vs decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function.
   -- Fluid resusitation
   -- Would use LR / D5
 NS with Bicarb as IV fluid
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS: Continue Keppra 500mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition and has a complex medical history.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypothermia, which has been resolved with rewarming
* Septic shock, which is likely related to a positive urine analysis and history of entero-uterine fistula
* Thrombocytopenia, acute, with unclear etiology
* Renal failure, acute, with a baseline creatinine of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL and current creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL
* Altered mental status, which is likely related to a systemic process
* Metabolic acidosis, which is likely related to GI losses or decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal failure

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of renal function, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease
* Development of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), or cardiac dysfunction
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, which can lead to hemorrhagic complications
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
* Development of adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, volume resuscitation, and transfusions of packed red blood cells. Further management should focus on optimizing fluid management, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and managing the patient's altered mental status."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC: Initial Infectious workup remarkable for a positive UA
   and history of entero-uterine fistula. Chest x-ray unremarkable, no
   meningeal symptoms although mental status is altered. Other possible
   sources include surgical site at Right BKA and left foot ulcers.
   -- Broad spectrum antibiotics; Vancomycin given multiple recent
   hospitalizations and Zosyn given concern for gram negatives, anaerobes
   and pseudomonas in this diabetic.
   -- Volume resusitate, CVP goal of 8
   -- Transfused two u pRBCs overnight
   -- F/U Blood, urine cultures
   -- [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test with appropriate rise in cortisol so adrenal
   insufficiency less likely
 HYPOTHERMIA: Ddx includes sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia and
   intracranial pathology.
   -- Intracranial pathology less likely as hypothermia resolved with
   rewarming
   -- Sepsis work up as above
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: Unclear etiology from prior admissions,
   suspect bone marrow supression vs consumptive process.
   -- No recent heparin
   --
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): : Baseline
   Creatinine 1.1 to 1.3, now 1.9 (down from 2.3 on admission). Given
   hypotension, suspect this most likely represents pre-renal azotemia,
   however differential diagnosis includes post renal and intrinsic
   process
   -- Urine culture
   -- Urine lytes
   -- Empiric fluids
   -- Renal ultrasound
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): Although baseline is very
   limited, per daughter patient less interactive than at baseline.
   Suspect this is likely to systemic process
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Very low bicarbonate on admission, lactate
   however was normal. No anion gap. Most likely this represents GI losses
   vs decreased bicarbonate production from acute renal function.
   -- Fluid resusitation
   -- Would use LR / D5
 NS with Bicarb as IV fluid
 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS: Continue Keppra 500mg daily
   -- Ask neuro to commet on question of non-convulsive status
   # H/o pancreatitis: Continue pancreatic enzyme supplementation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* General appearance: Thin and ill-looking
* Eyes: No PERRL (pupils are equal and reactive to light), conjunctiva pale
* Head, ears, nose, and throat: Normocephalic, poor dentition
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse and blood pressure
* Respiratory: Symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right leg absent, left leg with well-demarcated ulcer
* Neurological: Does not respond to stimuli, possible clonus in the left leg
* Skin: Cool

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 47 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 123 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 123 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with:

* Septic shock
* Hypothermia
* Hypoglycemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Acute renal failure
* Altered mental status
* Metabolic acidosis

The patient is being treated with:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Volume resuscitation
* Transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells
* Fibrinogen replacement therapy
* Renal ultrasound
* Empiric fluids
* Renal replacement therapy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-induced multi-organ failure
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Thrombocytopenia-induced bleeding
* Metabolic acidosis-induced complications
* Hypoglycemia-induced complications
* Hypothermia-induced complications

The patient's condition is guarded, and further evaluation and management are needed to address her underlying issues and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia, without an obvious source of infection. The patient is in a guarded condition.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.8°C, Tcurrent 36.6°C, HR 79 bpm, BP 136/62 mmHg, RR 16 breaths/min, SpO2 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 6 mmHg, CO/CI (Fick) 5 L/min/3.8 L/min/m2, Mixed Venous O2% Sat 77-77%
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device none, ABG //18/
* Neurological status: Opens eyes to voice, responds to simple commands, moves extremities on command
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC 15.9-17.5 K/uL
	+ Hct 19.2-34%
	+ Plt 47-55 K/uL
	+ Cr 1.9-2.0 mg/dL
	+ TropT 0.02 ng/mL
	+ TCO2 14 mmHg
	+ Glucose 123-158 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 12.3/37.0/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 30/5/0.02, ALT/AST 50/40, Alk Phos/T Bili 267/0.3, Differential-Neuts 94.0%, Band 4.0%, Lymph 1.0%, Mono 0.0%, Eos 0.0%, D-dimer 751 ng/mL, Fibrinogen 542 mg/dL, Lactic Acid 1.5 mmol/L, Albumin 2.7 g/dL, LDH 175 IU/L, Ca++ 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.6 mg/dL, PO4 3.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has a history of entero-uterine fistula and a positive UA, which may indicate a septic source. The patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia may be related to septic shock.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which may be related to bone marrow suppression or a consumptive process. The patient's history of prior admissions and chronic malabsorption may contribute to this condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.9 mg/dL, which may indicate acute renal failure. The patient's hypotension and potential septic shock may contribute to this condition.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and the patient is less interactive than at baseline. The patient's condition may be related to a systemic process, and the patient's improving mental status may indicate resolution of the underlying cause.
5. Acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is low, which may indicate metabolic acidosis. The patient's lactate level is normal, and the anion gap is not present, which suggests that the acidosis is not related to a metabolic disorder.
6. Seizure activity: The patient has had a seizure, and the patient's condition may be related to non-convulsive status. The patient's EEG is pending to evaluate for seizure activity.
7. Infection: The patient's positive UA and history of entero-uterine fistula may indicate an infection. The patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia may be related to septic shock.

Based on the patient's condition, the following recommendations are made:

1. Continue IVF prn hypotension, MAP > 60
2. P/RBC if Hct actively starts dropping
3. Follow-up CXR
4. Continue Zosyn day #2
5. F/u Hem/Onc recs
6. Send folate, B12, iron studies in the setting of chronic malabsorption and e/o pernicious anemia on EGD
7. Stop IV ppi (as may be contributing)
8. Follow-up neuro recs
9. No need for LP currently
10. EEG today
11. Continue pancreatic enzyme supplementation
12. Hold ASA currently in setting of acute thrombocytopenia
13. ECHO to evaluate for severity of diastolic dysfunction

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a complex medical condition, including recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and altered mental status, without an obvious source of infection. The patient has a guarded condition, and the note highlights several potential medical complications that can arise.

The patient has a history of entero-uterine fistula, and the infectious workup is remarkable for a positive urine culture. The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Zosyn, due to concerns about gram-negative, anaerobic, and pseudomonas infections. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and the note suggests that the patient may be experiencing pre-renal azotemia due to hypotension.

The patient has also developed acute renal failure, and the note suggests that the differential diagnosis includes post-renal and intrinsic processes. The patient's mental status is altered, and the note suggests that this may be related to a systemic process.

The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, anemia, and malabsorption, and the note suggests that the etiology of these conditions is unclear. The patient has also developed acidosis, which is likely related to GI losses or decreased bicarbonate production due to acute renal function.

The patient has a history of seizure activity, and the note suggests that the patient may be experiencing non-convulsive status. The patient's cardiovascular status is also compromised, with evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram.

The patient's ICU care plan includes the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and blood transfusions. The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and the note suggests that the patient should be NPO for now. The patient's prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis.

The patient's family has been informed of the patient's condition, and the note suggests that the patient's daughter is aware of the patient's full code status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 63-year-old female admitted 2-3 days ago with sepsis, seizures, and a history of diabetes, enterovaginal fistulas, CVA, and seizure history. She has been experiencing hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia, which have improved with treatment. She has also had a seizure, which was post-ictal and showed slight improvement later.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and has had a trans-thoracic echo and ultrasound performed. She has been experiencing thrombocytopenia and anemia, and has had a hematology consult. She is also experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium, and has had a head CT that was negative.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 47
* White blood cell count: 15.9
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.9
* TropT: 0.02
* Troponin-T: 0.02
* CK: 30
* CKMB: 5
* ALT: 50
* AST: 40
* Alk Phos: 267
* T Bili: 0.3
* Differential-Neuts: 94.0%
* Band: 4.0%
* Lymph: 1.0%
* Mono: 0.0%
* Eos: 0.0%
* D-dimer: 751 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 542 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 175 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis
* Seizures
* Thrombocytopenia
* Acute renal failure
* Altered mental status
* Metabolic acidosis
* Pancreatitis
* Chronic heart failure
* Hypothermia
* Shock
* Malnutrition

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for empiric UTI
* Clarifying baseline with family regarding seizure
* Continuing Keppra and getting EEG today
* Suspending PPI and discontinuing ranitidine
* Starting maintenance IVF and following Cr levels
* Suspecting pre-renal acute renal failure and planning to start maintenance IVF
* Continuing ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia, without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition.

The patient has a history of entero-uterine fistula, and a chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe opacity, which is concerning for pneumonia. Other possible sources of infection include her right below-knee amputation (BKA) and left foot ulcers.

The patient's mental status is improving, and she is now able to respond to simple commands. However, her altered mental status is likely related to a systemic process.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is suspected to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following hypotension. Her creatinine levels have increased from 1.1-1.3 to 1.9, and her renal US is negative.

The patient has also developed thrombocytopenia, which is unclear in etiology. Possible causes include bone marrow suppression, consumptive process, or chronic malabsorption.

Other medical conditions and concerns include:

* Hypoglycemia: resolved with D5 with 3 amps bicarb overnight
* Acidosis, metabolic: resolved with fluid resuscitation with NS
* Seizure: patient had a seizure without status epilepticus, and is being treated with Keppra 500mg daily
* Pancreatitis: patient has a history of pancreatitis and is being treated with pancreatic enzyme supplementation
* CAD: patient has a history of CAD and is being treated with ASA, which is currently being held due to the patient's inability to tolerate POs
* CVA: patient has a history of CVA and is being treated with ASA, which is currently being held due to the patient's inability to tolerate POs

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: given the patient's history of entero-uterine fistula and pneumonia, she is at risk for developing sepsis
* Worsening of renal function: the patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly
* Bleeding: the patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding
* Infection: the patient's altered mental status and fever may indicate an underlying infection
* Cardiac complications: the patient's history of CAD and CVA may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia without an obvious source of infection. She is in a guarded condition.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 161/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Central venous pressure: 7 mmHg

The patient has a history of pancreatitis, chronic heart failure, and chronic hypothermia. She is currently being treated for septic shock, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's recurrent hypotension, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's acute thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's history of pancreatitis and chronic malabsorption can lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate her underlying conditions.
5. Infection: The patient's positive urine analysis and history of entero-uterine fistula suggest a high risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
7. Seizures: The patient's history of seizure disorder and altered mental status increase the risk of seizure recurrence.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* IV fluids and vasopressors to manage hypotension
* Antibiotics to treat sepsis
* Renal replacement therapy to manage acute renal failure
* Platelet transfusions to manage thrombocytopenia
* Nutritional support to manage malnutrition
* Anticonvulsant therapy to manage seizure disorder
* Electrolyte management to manage acidosis

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her underlying conditions and the risk of complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
