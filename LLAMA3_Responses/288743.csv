   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypothermia, and lactate of 4.2. She has a port-a-cath and is receiving levophed for hypotension. She is delirious, seeing ""mice in the walls,"" and has been prescribed zyprexa. Her lactate levels are trending down, and she has received vitamin K for a high INR (1.9). She has a low urine output, and a fluid bolus was given. She has a history of chemotherapy, including gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, and has recently undergone ERCP and stent placement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, hypothermia, and lactate levels suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirious behavior, including seeing ""mice in the walls,"" may be caused by multiple factors, including liver failure, antibiotics, and steroids, which increases her mortality risk.
3. Synthetic Liver Failure: The patient's INR is elevated, which may indicate synthetic liver failure, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt attention.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level may indicate pancytopenia, which is a complication of chemotherapy.
5. Cholestasis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest cholestasis, which may be caused by metastatic breast cancer, chemotherapy, or other factors.
6. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's metastatic breast cancer may progress and spread to other parts of her body, including her brain, lung, liver, and bone.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, which may lead to liver failure, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
8. Renal Failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt attention.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including her blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Administer antibiotics to treat sepsis, if present.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension, hypothermia, and a lactate level of 4.2. They have a PortaCath in place, which was attempted to be converted to a central line, but the procedure was stopped due to the patient's delirium and stable levophed requirements. The patient is receiving norepinephrine for hypotension and vitamin K for a high INR. They have a low urine output and received a 500cc fluid bolus. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 125 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/69 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated lactate level, anemia, and abnormal liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level of 4.2 and elevated liver enzymes may indicate the presence of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low urine output and need for a fluid bolus may indicate hypovolemia, which can lead to further compromise of their circulatory function.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be a sign of underlying organ dysfunction or infection, which needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's high INR and need for vitamin K may indicate a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's low SpO2 and need for oxygen therapy may indicate respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and potential intubation.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia may be a sign of underlying cardiac dysfunction or electrolyte imbalance, which needs to be monitored and addressed promptly.
7. Infection: The patient's abnormal laboratory results may indicate the presence of an underlying infection, which needs to be identified and treated promptly to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension - Patient met SIRS criteria with T < 96 and SBP<70 on the
   floor prior to transfer which has now resolved with 3L IVF bolus and
   broadening of antibitoics to include vancomycin and zosyn.  Likely
   source is biliary duct obstruction but also has long-standin effusion
   and line as possible sources. ERCP team following. Patient with right
   porta-cath as only access. Patient currently full code. Given widely
   metastatic breast CA, primary oncologist to readress goals of care with
   patient and family.
   - will likely need Central venous line, plan to discuss goals of care
   with husband first
   - IV fluids to [**Name (NI) 949**]>30cc/hr, start levophed via port
   - repeat portable CXR
   - Transfuse for Hct < 30
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics including vanco/unasyn/cipro
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   .
   # Cholestasis - On presentation, concern for possible CBD stone or
   sludge or worsening metastatic disease. She is s/p ERCP with stent
   [**2187-8-16**] with downtrending LFTs but Tbili remains in [**11-24**] range. Patient
   without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or acute rise in LFTs to
   support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on cipro for planned 5 day
   course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - broaden coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypothermia, and a lactate level of 4.2. She has a history of chemotherapy and has undergone various treatments, including radiation and stent placement.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 125 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 94/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 83 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* INR: 1.7

The patient has a central line placed, but it was not inserted due to the patient's delirium and unstable condition. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn, and is being treated for hypotension with levophed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and she has a history of chemotherapy and metastatic disease, which may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she may be at risk for developing respiratory failure if her condition deteriorates.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and she may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias if her condition deteriorates.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's INR is elevated, and she may be at risk for developing hepatic failure if her condition deteriorates.
* Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she may be at risk for developing pancytopenia if her condition deteriorates.
* Synthetic liver failure: The patient's INR is elevated, and she may be at risk for developing synthetic liver failure if her condition deteriorates.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that she continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy as needed. The patient's oncologist should be consulted to discuss further management options, including possible changes to her chemotherapy regimen."

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension and hypothermia. She is currently receiving fluids, antibiotics, and levophed to manage her condition. The patient is unable to provide a history due to encephalopathy, and her mental status is lethargic. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. She is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula and oxygen therapy. Laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, decreased urine output, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's increasing lactate levels and decreasing urine output suggest that she may be at risk for septic shock, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which may indicate liver failure or metastasis. This could lead to further complications, such as coagulopathy, bleeding, and decreased albumin production.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a SpO2 of 97% on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. She may be at risk for respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unknown, and her heart rate is elevated. She may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, but she may still be at risk for infection, particularly given her immunocompromised state.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status is altered, and she may be at risk for further neurological deterioration.
7. Fluid overload: The patient has received significant amounts of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and further compromise her respiratory and cardiac status.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension and hypothermia. She has been receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Zosyn, and is being treated for septic shock. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. She is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, decreased urine output, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's increasing lactate levels and decreasing urine output suggest that she may be experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's metastatic breast cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
3. Biliary Source of Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock may be caused by a biliary source, which could lead to further complications, such as cholangitis or pancreatitis.
4. Antibiotic Resistance: The patient's ongoing treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn may not be effective against her infection, leading to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support with a nasal cannula may not be sufficient to manage her respiratory needs, leading to further complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's encephalopathy may be a sign of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cerebral edema.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic ER+/Her2+ breast cancer, previously treated with various chemotherapy regimens, radiation, and targeted therapies. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated bilirubin levels due to metastatic disease. The patient had been made Comfort Measures Only (CMO) per family wishes, and the focus is now on comfort and supportive treatment only.

The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate IV infusion at 4mg/hr, which has been titrated to comfort. She is also receiving heparin sodium prophylactically. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 121bpm, and blood pressure of 86/57mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5, hemoglobin of 9.2g/dL, and platelet count of 81K/uL. Her liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 268 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 65 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and her laboratory results show elevated inflammatory markers, which may indicate ongoing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, which may indicate respiratory compromise.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may indicate hepatic failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.5mg/dL, which may indicate renal failure.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin prophylactically, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient has a central line and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
8. Neurological compromise: The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, as evidenced by her decreased level of consciousness and agonal breathing.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and neurological status closely. The patient's comfort and supportive treatment plan should be continued, and the family should be involved in decision-making regarding the patient's care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic ER+/Her2+ breast cancer, previously treated with various chemotherapy regimens, radiation, and targeted therapies. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes following ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 121 bpm (normal range: 96-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/57 mmHg (normal range: 77/45-128/87 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute (normal range: 15-41 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient has a history of sepsis, hypothermia, and hypotension, and was made Comfort Measures Only (CMO) per family wishes. The plan is to focus on comfort and supportive treatment only, with the goal of continuing morphine drip at 4mg/hr and titrating to comfort.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and she has coarse breath sounds throughout, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and her heart rate is elevated, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis and is receiving antibiotics, but the risk of infection remains high, particularly with the patient's compromised immune system.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid, and her fluid balance is not optimal, which may lead to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Nutritional deficits: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, and she may be at risk for malnutrition and related complications.
6. Pain management: The patient is receiving morphine drip, but her pain may not be adequately managed, which may lead to discomfort and potential complications.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient has metastatic disease to multiple organs, including brain, lung, liver, and bone, which may lead to organ dysfunction and related complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of cardiovascular instability, requiring vasopressor support with levophed, which was stopped due to family concerns. The patient is currently on IV morphine for pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 121 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/57 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94% and no oxygen delivery device in use. The patient's laboratory results show signs of organ dysfunction, including elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show signs of organ dysfunction, which may indicate the presence of sepsis. Further evaluation is necessary to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating AKI. This may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of AKI and initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating liver dysfunction. This may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of liver dysfunction and initiate appropriate treatment.
4. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and the patient requires vasopressor support. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of cardiovascular instability and initiate appropriate treatment.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 is stable, but the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as sepsis or AKI. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the patient's respiratory status and initiate appropriate treatment.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of gastrointestinal bleeding and initiate appropriate treatment.
7. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobility and underlying conditions. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the patient's VTE risk and initiate appropriate prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, electrolyte sliding scale
   .
   # Access: Port
   .
   # PPx:  hold HEP SC [**1-13**] coagulopathy, Bowel REgimen, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastatic to brain, lung, liver, and bone. She was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia, hypotension, and sepsis. She has a history of trastuzumab, carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation, capecitabine, cyberknife, and most recently gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab. She has a central venous line, indwelling port, and is receiving IV fluids, morphine, and levophed. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a high risk of complications due to her metastatic disease and poor liver function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to her metastatic disease and poor liver function, which can increase her risk of septic shock and death.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is poor, which can lead to encephalopathy, bleeding, and coagulopathy.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely due to chemotherapy, which can increase her risk of bleeding and infection.
4. Synthetic Liver Failure: The patient's metastatic disease can cause synthetic liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy and bleeding.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium can be multifactorial, including her poor liver function, new antibiotics, and steroids, which can increase her risk of mortality.
6. Cholestasis: The patient's cholestasis can lead to worsening abdominal pain, acute rise in LFTs, and new/worsening obstruction.
7. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's metastatic breast cancer can progress and cause new lesions, which can increase her risk of mortality.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can lead to respiratory arrest and death if not treated promptly.
10. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest can lead to cardiac death if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids, morphine, and levophed to manage the patient's hypotension and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function daily and adjust her medications accordingly.
3. Consider transfusing the patient for pancytopenia if her Hct is <21 or her plt is <10K/uL.
4. Avoid subclavian lines in setting of INR >1.9.
5. Continue stress dose steroids given the patient's recent decadron treatment.
6. Discuss code status with the patient and her family and address goals of care.
7. Consider hospice care for the patient given her poor prognosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

The patient is currently in comfort care mode after being changed from invasive treatments. They are encephalopathic, unable to provide a history, and unresponsive. Their vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 120 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 80/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 9 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 10.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 81 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15 mEq/L
* Sodium: 132 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Chloride: 100 mEq/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 5.0 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's flow sheet data shows:

* Fluid balance: 4,005 mL in, 462 mL out, resulting in a balance of 3,543 mL
* Urine output: 462 mL
* Blood products: 462 mL out
* Respiratory support: None

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's septic shock and respiratory failure, they are at risk for further septic complications.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state can lead to further neurological deterioration.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's mild tachypnea and lack of respiratory support increase their risk of respiratory failure.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a significant amount of fluid being administered, which can lead to fluid overload and worsen their respiratory and cardiac status.
5. Infection: The patient's indwelling port and prophylactic measures against DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP may increase their risk of infection.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations may indicate hemodynamic instability, which can worsen their condition.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's lab results suggest potential organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, and pancreatic impairment.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, lab results, and fluid balance closely to identify any potential complications and adjust their care accordingly."
