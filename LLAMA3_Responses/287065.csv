   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 129**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13877**] at [**Hospital1 **] who has taken care of him for 2 years.
   (cell phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 13878**], partners pager:[**Numeric Identifier 13879**]) Baseline hct:28-29.
   Getting aranesp only to avoid transfusions but family refused it last
   week (think causes inc secretions) so said maybe this week. Will give
   to him there if they will accept it. Baseline K 4.5-5.5. Baseline WBC
   [**11-21**]. Not been diuresing. No fevers. Had black tarry stools 2-3 weeks
   ago and was put on ppi but hct never dropped and thought might be
   related to intake not bleed. Scrotum always ""massive"". MS baseline is:
   opens eyes occasionally, non responsive. Will grimace to painful
   stimuli and occ flex legs. No spontaneous movement. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13877**] had
   talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**] on Friday to ask whether a stent would help but
   because it would have necessitated a transfer to ICU here for unclear
   benefit this was deferred however now that he's here if Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**] wants
   to do it that would be fine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's ABG results show improvement, with a pH of 7.34 and a PaO2 of 338 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is being continued, and the plan is to replace the tracheostomy tube with a different type of tube that will cover the flap of granulation tissue seen in the trachea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Upper Airway Obstruction: The patient's peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures are increased, which may be due to worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or mucous plugging. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Mucous Plugging: The patient's trachea is prone to mucous plugging, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be due to chronic renal insufficiency. This could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but it is unclear whether this is due to the patient's chronic condition or an underlying etiology. Further monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and prevent potential complications.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently well-controlled, but it is essential to continue monitoring for potential complications and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney function is currently at baseline, but it is essential to continue monitoring for potential complications and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Type Two Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is currently under control, but it is essential to continue monitoring for potential complications and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to potential complications and prolong recovery.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation. It is essential to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjust treatment as necessary.
10. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and other risk factors. It is essential to continue monitoring for signs of DVT and adjust treatment as necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including upper airway obstruction, mucous plugging, hyperkalemia, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney injury, type two diabetes, pressure ulcers, VAP, and DVT. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent these complications and promote optimal recovery."

   worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or mucous plugging with
   mucous plug most likely given improvement after suctioning
   - Continue nebs RTC
   - D/C abx as no evidence of PNA
   - Consider bronch to assure trach placement as similar presentation on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a tracheostomy tube. He has a history of tracheomalacia and mucous plugging, which may be contributing to his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular: He has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently well-controlled. He is also hypertensive, but this is being managed with medication.
* Renal: He has chronic kidney injury and is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his chronic kidney disease and potential nephrotoxic medications.
* Neurological: He has anoxic brain injury and is non-responsive, with occasional opening of his eyes and grimacing to painful stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or worsening tracheomalacia due to mucous plugging or tracheostomy tube malposition.
* Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction due to his hypertension and atrial fibrillation.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease due to nephrotoxic medications, hypovolemia, or sepsis.
* Neurological: Increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or worsening anoxic brain injury due to hypoxia, hypercapnia, or sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue nebulization therapy to help manage his respiratory failure.
* Discontinue antibiotics as there is no evidence of pneumonia.
* Consider bronchoscopy to assure tracheostomy tube placement and to rule out tracheomalacia or mucous plugging.
* Suction his airway as needed to avoid mucous plugging.
* Monitor his electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose levels closely due to his chronic kidney disease and diabetes.
* Continue his anti-hypertensive medications and monitor his blood pressure closely.
* Monitor his cardiac rhythm on telemetry and continue his home regimen of calcium channel blockers.
* Continue his chronic bladder irrigation and monitor his urine output.
* Avoid nephrotoxic medications and monitor his electrolytes and creatinine levels closely.
* Obtain a nutrition consult to develop a plan for his nutritional needs.
* Monitor his glycemic control and hold his glipizide medication until further notice."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 Would like to get him back to [**Hospital1 **] as soon as
   trach tube is replaced,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, anoxic brain injury, and type two diabetes. He was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. He is receiving invasive ventilation and is trached and ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.5%
* Platelet count: 346 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Blood glucose: 174 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypercarbic respiratory failure
* Hypotension (resolved)
* Hyperkalemia (resolved)
* Atrial fibrillation (in sinus rhythm)
* Chronic kidney injury
* Type two diabetes
* Chronic foley catheter (inoperable hernia)

The patient's current plan includes:

* Replacement of trach tube with a new type that should cover the granulation tissue
* Continue nebs (nebulized treatments)
* Discontinue antibiotics as no evidence of pneumonia
* Suction PRN (as needed) to avoid mucous plugging
* Restart anti-hypertensives for now
* Monitor on telemetry for atrial fibrillation
* Continue ISS (insulin sensitivity test) for glycemic control
* Hold glipizide for now while working out TF recs (to be determined)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction from worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or mucous plugging
* Infection due to prolonged use of invasive ventilation and tracheostomy
* Bleeding due to coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction
* Hyperkalemia due to potassium-sparing medications or kidney dysfunction
* Hypotension due to hypovolemia, vasodilation, or cardiac dysfunction
* Atrial fibrillation due to electrolyte imbalance, cardiac disease, or medications
* Chronic kidney injury due to nephrotoxins, hypovolemia, or underlying kidney disease
* Type two diabetes due to insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, or inadequate treatment"

   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient with chronic respiratory
   failure at baseline with ABG on last admission 168/67/7.33. Increased
   peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures possible upper airway
   obstruction from either worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or
   mucous plugging. Improved with suction (ABG 7.24/84/132 ->
   7.34/66/134), appears to be at respiratory baseline.  Bronch yesterday
   showed granulation tissue blocking trachea, which may intermittently
   cause episodes of respiratory distress.  IP plans to replace trach tube
   with new type which should cover this tissue.
   - IP replacement of trach tube
   - Continue nebs
   - D/C abx as no evidence of PNA
   - Suction PRN to avoid mucous plugging, being cautious not to
   manipulate tissue flap in a way that causes occlusion
   .
   # Hypotension: Currently resolved. Unclear etiology and severity as no
   record of hypotension from rehab.
   - Restart anti-hypertensives for now as slightly hypertensive at this
   point with strict holding parameters (amlodipine thrice weekly (MWF),
   prazosin 1mg PO daily)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolved
   - recheck K on arrival to floor
   - Recheck EKG
   - Monitor on telemetry

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. His current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 51 bpm
* Blood pressure: 151/73 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has been intubated and is receiving invasive ventilation. His ABG results show:

* pH: 7.34
* PaCO2: 66 mmHg
* PaO2: 134 mmHg

The patient has a history of black tarry stools and was placed on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to prevent bleeding. However, his hemoglobin level has not decreased, suggesting that the bleeding may be related to his intake rather than a bleeding disorder.

The patient has a massive scrotum and a chronic foley catheter in place. He is also experiencing hyperkalemia, which has been resolved.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 24.5%
* Platelet count: 346 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
* Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney injury, type two diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and has a code status of full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can lead to respiratory acidosis, which can worsen his respiratory distress.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of black tarry stools and his ongoing bleeding can lead to hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and anoxic brain injury make him susceptible to respiratory and systemic infections.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney injury can worsen with ongoing kidney damage, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyperkalemia and hypokalemia can lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can worsen his cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
7. Wound complications: The patient's chronic foley catheter and inoperable hernia can lead to wound complications, such as infection, abscess, or fistula.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue invasive ventilation to manage his respiratory failure.
2. Monitor his ABG results to ensure that his respiratory acidosis is controlled.
3. Manage his bleeding by continuing to monitor his hemoglobin level and platelet count.
4. Monitor his electrolyte levels to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
5. Continue prophylactic subcutaneous heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
6. Monitor his cardiac status to prevent cardiovascular complications.
7. Monitor his wound status to prevent wound complications.

I recommend that the patient be closely monitored and managed in the ICU to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Patient with chronic respiratory
   failure at baseline with ABG on last admission 168/67/7.33. Increased
   peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures possible upper airway
   obstruction from either worsening tracheomalacia, trach malposition, or
   mucous plugging. Improved with suction (ABG 7.24/84/132 ->
   7.34/66/134), appears to be at respiratory baseline.  Bronch yesterday
   showed granulation tissue blocking trachea, which may intermittently
   cause episodes of respiratory distress.  IP plans to replace trach tube
   with new type which should cover this tissue.
   - IP replacement of trach tube
   - Continue nebs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 129**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13877**] at [**Hospital1 **] who has taken care of him for 2 years.
   (cell phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 13878**], partners pager:[**Numeric Identifier 13879**]) Baseline hct:28-29.
   Getting aranesp only to avoid transfusions but family refused it last
   week (think causes inc secretions) so said maybe this week. Will give
   to him there if they will accept it. Baseline K 4.5-5.5. Baseline WBC
   [**11-21**]. Not been diuresing. No fevers. Had black tarry stools 2-3 weeks
   ago and was put on ppi but hct never dropped and thought might be
   related to intake not bleed. Scrotum always ""massive"". MS baseline is:
   opens eyes occasionally, non responsive. Will grimace to painful
   stimuli and occ flex legs. No spontaneous movement. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13877**] had
   talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**] on Friday to ask whether a stent would help but
   because it would have necessitated a transfer to ICU here for unclear
   benefit this was deferred however now that he's here if Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2249**] wants
   to do it that would be fine.
   - ABG 11am 7.24/84/132, 3pm 7.34/66/134
   - Bronch at 5:30, flap of granulation tissue seen in trachea, IP called
   who rebronched, plan to replace trach in am with a different type of
   trach that will cover this flap.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following conditions and potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure has worsened, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition can cause respiratory acidosis, increased work of breathing, and decreased oxygenation.
2. Tracheomalacia: The patient has a history of tracheomalacia, which may worsen with time and cause respiratory distress. This condition can lead to upper airway obstruction, decreased lung volumes, and increased respiratory effort.
3. Granulation tissue in the trachea: The bronchoscopy revealed granulation tissue blocking the trachea, which may intermittently cause episodes of respiratory distress. This condition can lead to respiratory failure, increased work of breathing, and decreased oxygenation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was previously unrecorded, but it is currently resolved. However, the etiology and severity of the hypotension are unclear, and the patient may be at risk for recurrent episodes.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were previously elevated, but they have since resolved. However, the patient may be at risk for recurrent episodes of hyperkalemia, particularly if they have underlying kidney disease or cardiac conditions.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may increase their risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
7. Chronic foley catheter: The patient has a chronic foley catheter in place, which may increase their risk of urinary tract infections and bladder damage.
8. Chronic kidney injury: The patient has a history of chronic kidney injury, which may increase their risk of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
9. Type Two Diabetes: The patient has a history of type two diabetes, which may increase their risk of cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is NPO and requires tube feeds, which may increase their risk of malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Heart failure
* Stroke
* Urinary tract infections
* Bladder damage
* Acute kidney injury
* Chronic kidney disease
* End-stage renal disease
* Cardiovascular disease
* Nephropathy
* Retinopathy
* Malnutrition
* Dehydration
* Electrolyte imbalances

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and ensure their optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, anoxic brain injury, and multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney injury, and type two diabetes. He was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is now resolving. He has undergone a tracheostomy tube replacement and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 91%. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, ventilator mode, and oxygen delivery device.

The patient's laboratory results show normal ranges for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and calcium. His electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm, and his imaging studies are pending.

The patient's plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, nebulization therapy, and suctioning as needed to avoid mucous plugging. He will also receive treatment for hypertension, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney injury, as well as monitoring for type two diabetes.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP.
4. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient's indwelling urinary catheter may increase the risk of CAUTI.
5. Wound infection: The patient's tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of wound infection.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's underlying chronic kidney injury and hyperkalemia may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or myocardial infarction.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic kidney injury and type two diabetes may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, and anoxic brain injury. He was admitted with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has improved with suctioning, and his ABG values have normalized. The patient's tracheostomy tube was replaced, and bronchoscopy showed granulation tissue blocking the trachea, which may cause intermittent respiratory distress. The patient has also been experiencing hypotension, hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney injury, and type two diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's tracheomalacia and granulation tissue in the trachea may cause intermittent respiratory distress, which could worsen his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to an unknown etiology, and it is unclear whether it is related to his chronic kidney injury or other comorbidities. If left untreated, hypotension could lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia has been resolved, but it is essential to monitor his potassium levels and EKG to prevent future episodes.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently being monitored, but it is essential to continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke and other thrombotic events.
5. Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's chronic kidney injury is being managed with renally adjusted medications and monitoring of electrolytes and creatinine. However, if left untreated, chronic kidney injury could lead to end-stage renal disease.
6. Type Two Diabetes: The patient's type two diabetes is being managed with insulin and monitoring of his blood glucose levels. However, if left untreated, type two diabetes could lead to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
7. Mucous Plugging: The patient's tracheomalacia and granulation tissue in the trachea may cause mucous plugging, which could worsen his respiratory distress and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
8. Tracheostomy Tube Displacement: The patient's tracheostomy tube may become displaced, which could lead to respiratory distress and hypoxia.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation may increase his risk of developing VAP, which could worsen his respiratory failure and increase his risk of mortality.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers, which could lead to infections and other complications."
