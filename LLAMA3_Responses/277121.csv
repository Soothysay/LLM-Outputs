   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen).
   Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG.
   Tropononin wnl but BNP is markedly elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding
   due to crohn's disease, concern for use of TPA would be GI bleed and
   intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH.
   - heparin drip with bolus
   - mechanical ventilation; will ultimately try to wean FIO2 if possible
   - minimize PEEP to limit dead space ventillation
   - type and cross 4 units of PRBCs
   - ensure stable access in anticipation of possible lysis
   - TPA 100 mg over 2 hours if hypotensive or worsening respiratory
   status
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and HISS.
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - RISS and glargine
   - consider insulin drip if significant hyperglycemia and there is
   enough access for it
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and possible TPA
   .
   Hyperkalemia.  Likely due to acidosis and renal failure.
   - insulin/d50
   - sodium bicarb
   - IVFs
   - serial Lytes
   - Kayexelate
   .
   HTN.
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and chronic steroid use, was admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has a massive clot burden on computed tomography angiography (CTA) with significant hypoxia, and evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient is on heparin drip with bolus, mechanical ventilation, and is being monitored for signs of bleeding and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a risk of further embolism or bleeding.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Right Heart Strain: The patient's right heart strain may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent GI bleeding increases the risk of further bleeding.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's type 2 diabetes and steroid use increase the risk of hyperglycemia, which may require insulin therapy.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have been elevated, and there is a risk of further renal failure.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to chronic steroid use, but it may also indicate an underlying infection.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia may be due to acidosis and renal failure, and may require treatment with insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and IV fluids.
9. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may require treatment with antihypertensive medications.
10. Infection: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent GI bleeding increases the risk of infection, which may require antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status. The heparin drip with bolus will be continued, and the patient will be monitored for signs of bleeding and hypotension. The patient's blood glucose levels will be closely monitored, and insulin therapy may be initiated if hyperglycemia develops. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and renally adjusted medications will be used as necessary. The patient's leukocytosis will be monitored, and antibiotics will be considered if an underlying infection is suspected. The patient's hyperkalemia will be treated with insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and IV fluids as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and on steroids, who was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's condition has improved significantly after lysis with heparin drip, with marked improvement in respiratory status, oxygenation, and end-tidal CO2 levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition and treatment include:

1. GI bleeding: Given the patient's recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and the use of heparin drip and TPA, there is a risk of GI bleeding.
2. Intracranial hemorrhage: The use of TPA increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Renal failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, and the patient is receiving heparin drip, which may exacerbate renal failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low CVP and recent hypotension suggest hypovolemia, which may be related to the massive PE.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely related to chronic steroid use, and monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient is a type 2 diabetic and is likely to become hyperglycemic due to steroid use, requiring close monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin therapy.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the use of heparin drip, requiring prophylaxis.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to intubation and immobility, requiring prophylaxis with HOB elevation and mouth care.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
2. PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
3. IVF boluses for low CVP
4. Type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
5. Stress dose steroids
6. Renally dose all meds
7. Monitor WBC, fever curve
8. Tube feeding
9. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with several days of shortness of breath and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently receiving treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is being monitored closely.

The patient's condition has improved significantly since the lysis of the PE, with improved hemodynamics and gas exchange. However, the patient is still experiencing some complications, including:

1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been elevated, which may be related to the PE or another underlying infection.
2. Melena: The patient has been experiencing rectal bleeding, which may be related to the Crohn's disease or a complication of the PE.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been elevated, which may be related to the stress of the illness or the use of corticosteroids.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, which may be related to the PE or another underlying condition.

The patient is receiving treatment for these complications, including:

1. Heparin: The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent further thrombosis.
2. Stress dose steroids: The patient is receiving stress dose steroids to help manage the inflammation associated with the Crohn's disease.
3. Mesalamine: The patient is receiving mesalamine to help manage the inflammation associated with the Crohn's disease.
4. Regular insulin sliding scale: The patient is receiving regular insulin to help manage his blood sugar levels.
5. Fluid resuscitation: The patient is receiving fluid resuscitation to help manage his hypotension.

The patient's plan is to continue receiving treatment in the ICU and to be monitored closely for any further complications. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and recent submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) requiring intubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, and the note mentions that he has evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram, CT chest, and EKG.

The patient's recent lab results show:

* WBC: 17.1
* Hct: 30.5
* Plt: 267
* Cr: 1.3
* TropT: 0.05
* TCO2: 26
* Glucose: 292
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/68.6/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 78/0.05, ALT/AST: 13/15, Alk Phos/T Bili: 45/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 81.7%, Lymph: 13.8%, Mono: 3.5%, Eos: 0.9%, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.3 g/dL, LDH: 252 IU/L, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's current condition is stable, with:

* Tcurrent: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* HR: 88 bpm (81-106 bpm)
* BP: 159/89 mmHg (113/62 mmHg - 167/96 mmHg)
* RR: 18 inspirations per minute (11-26 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* O2 delivery device: Nasal cannula
* Ventilator mode: Standby
* Vt (set): 0 mL (0-0 mL)
* Vt (spontaneous): 525 mL (525-525 mL)
* PS: 5 cmH2O
* RR (set): 0
* PEEP: 5 cmH2O
* FiO2: 40%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's medication list includes:

* Heparin Sodium: 1,500 units/hour
* Pantoprazole (Protonix): 12:02 PM
* Morphine Sulfate: 12:00 AM
* Other medications: Infusions, serial HCTs, stable

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and is currently experiencing bloody stools. The use of heparin and TPA may increase the risk of GI bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low CVPs suggest hypovolemia, which may be related to the massive PE.
3. Renal failure: The patient's recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, and his current value is within his normal range.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, likely due to chronic steroid use. No clear sign of infection is present.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may require ongoing respiratory support.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's right heart strain and elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiovascular complications.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and mild elevation of troponin-T suggest the possibility of infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
* PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
* IVF boluses for low CVP
* Type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
* Stress dose steroids given that the patient is on chronic steroids and is now critically ill
* Renally dose all meds
* Follow Cr
* Monitor WBC, fever curve
* Consider long-acting insulin if improved
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis
* VAP prophylaxis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and recent submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 159/89 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% FiO2. He has a right-sided pleural effusion and is on invasive ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 267 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 17.1 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.05 ng/mL
* BNP: markedly elevated
* Lactate: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* LDH: 252 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Pulmonary embolism with significant hypoxia and right heart strain
* Type 2 diabetes with recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease
* Recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease with recent colonoscopy showing significant colonic inflammation
* Hypertension
* Hypotension likely related to massive PE
* Renal failure with creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 mg/dL
* Leukocytosis likely related to chronic steroid use

The patient's plan includes:

* Heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
* PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
* IVF boluses for low CVP
* Type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
* Stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is now critically ill
* Monitor WBC and fever curve
* Renally dose all meds
* Follow creatinine levels

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* GI bleeding due to Crohn's disease and heparin use
* Intracranial hemorrhage due to TPA use
* Hypovolemia due to massive PE and hypotension
* Worsening of renal failure
* Infection due to chronic steroid use and immunosuppression
* VAP due to invasive ventilation
* DVT due to heparin use

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple complex medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not explicitly stated, but the note highlights the patient's ongoing struggles with gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 159/89 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results reveal ongoing renal impairment, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hyperkalemia (potassium level of 5.3 mmol/L) and hypocalcemia (calcium level of 8.4 mg/dL).

The patient's bleeding disorder is ongoing, with bloody stools and a platelet count of 267,000/μL. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 68.6 seconds.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, but the ventilator mode is set to standby, and the patient is not requiring assistance.

The patient's neurological status is not assessed in the note, but the patient is able to respond to stimuli and is not experiencing any obvious neurological deficits.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin and abnormal laboratory results increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and abnormal coagulation profile increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or retroperitoneal bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure if not adequately managed, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's acute pulmonary embolism can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not promptly treated.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death if not adequately managed.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing respiratory support increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple complex medical conditions, including gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary embolism. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their conditions to prevent potential medical complications and improve their overall outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa, will consult GI for
   help managing Crohn
s flare
   - if no contraindication, will decrease to pre-hospitalization steroid
   dose
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   - hct
s stable so far, but still having maroon stools
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr, trending down
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa, will consult GI for
   help managing Crohn

   - if no contraindication, will decrease to pre-hospitalization steroid
   dose
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   - hct
s stable so far, but still having maroon stools
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr, trending down
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and is on steroids. The patient underwent lytic therapy and was extubated. He is currently on heparin drip and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient has been experiencing bloody stools and is on heparin drip, which increases the risk of bleeding. Stress dose steroids have been given to manage this risk.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low CVPs suggest hypovolemia, and he is at risk for further hypotension.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been ranging from 1.3 to 2.0, and he is at risk for further decline in renal function.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, likely due to chronic steroid use. Monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 267, which is low. Monitoring for further decline in platelet count is necessary.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is still at risk for further respiratory failure.
7. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he is at risk for developing sepsis.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's right heart strain on echo and EKG suggests cardiac involvement. Monitoring for cardiac complications is necessary.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's elevated troponin and BNP suggest cardiac involvement, and monitoring for neurological complications is necessary.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is improving, but he is still at risk for various complications. The plan includes:

1. Continuing heparin drip to manage PE.
2. Monitoring for GI bleeding and stress dose steroids as needed.
3. Managing hypotension with IVF boluses and holding antihypertensives.
4. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages as needed.
5. Monitoring WBC count and fever curve for signs of infection.
6. Monitoring platelet count for thrombocytopenia.
7. Continuing respiratory support as needed.
8. Monitoring for cardiac and neurological complications.
9. Consulting GI for help managing Crohn's disease flare.
10. Stress dose steroids to manage Crohn's disease flare.
11. Decreasing steroid dose if no contraindication.
12. Type and cross for 6 units of blood.
13. Q 4-6 hour HCTs.
14. Following Cr levels, trending down.
15. Renally dosing all medications.
16. Monitoring for signs of infection.
17. Holding antihypertensives.
18. IVF boluses for low CVP.
19. Renal failure management.
20. Leukocytosis management.
21. Thrombocytopenia management.
22. Respiratory failure management.
23. Sepsis management.
24. Cardiac complications management.
25. Neurological complications management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and recent submassive pulmonary embolism (PE), was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring intubation. He was successfully extubated and is currently receiving heparin drip and stress dose steroids. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is likely to become hyperglycemic due to steroid use. He also has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and has been experiencing worsening symptoms with steroid taper.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding**: The patient's bloody stools and recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease increase the risk of GI bleeding. Heparin therapy and stress dose steroids may exacerbate this risk.
2. **Hypotension**: The patient's low CVPs suggest hypovolemia, which may be exacerbated by antihypertensive medications. IVF boluses may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. **Renal failure**: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, indicating potential renal impairment. Renal dose adjustment of medications and close monitoring of creatinine levels are necessary.
4. **Leukocytosis**: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to chronic steroid use. Monitoring of WBC and fever curve is necessary to rule out infection.
5. **Infection**: The patient's recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and chronic steroid use increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect early signs of infection.
6. **Pulmonary embolism**: The patient's recent PE and ongoing heparin therapy increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as GI bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
7. **Hyperglycemia**: The patient's type 2 diabetes and steroid use increase the risk of hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin therapy may be necessary to maintain glycemic control.

**Plan:**

1. Continue heparin drip and stress dose steroids to manage PE and GI bleeding risk.
2. Monitor CVPs and IVF boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Renally dose medications and closely monitor creatinine levels to detect early signs of renal impairment.
4. Monitor WBC and fever curve to rule out infection.
5. Continue to monitor vital signs and laboratory results to detect early signs of infection or other complications.
6. Consider long-acting insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's progress and adjust therapy as necessary to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and was successfully lysed. He was extubated and is currently receiving heparin therapy. His vital signs are stable, and he is receiving regular diet and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. He has a central line and arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially in the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which may increase the risk of GIB. The slow GIB noted in the progress note may indicate a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) recurrence: The patient has already experienced a massive PE and is receiving heparin therapy. There is a risk of DVT and PE recurrence if the anticoagulation therapy is not effective or if the patient develops a new thrombotic event.
4. Anticoagulation-related bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially in the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient has a central line and arterial line in place, which may increase the risk of infection.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is receiving oxygen therapy, which may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
8. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to minimize the risk of these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and has since undergone lysis and extubation. The patient's current condition is stable, with no signs of distress or discomfort.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 93 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 159/87 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 90%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 16 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 17.1 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count (Plt): 267 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* LDH: 252 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): Bases not visualized
* Sputum culture: Pending

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing systemic anticoagulation with heparin
* Holding off on coumadin for now
* Checking levels of international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)
* Discussing optimal Crohn's regimen with the patient's gastroenterologist
* Starting prednisone and mesalamine for now
* Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Stress ulceration
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Worsening of Crohn's disease

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications early on and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 56-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease, and is currently taking steroids and metformin. The patient's laboratory results show anemia (Hct 27.6%), elevated white blood cell count (WBC 10.8 K/uL), and elevated lactate acid (1.3 mmol/L). His coagulation profile shows a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1.

The patient's clinical course is marked by ongoing maroon stools, stable hematocrit, and a slight decrease in hemoglobin. He has a history of upper endoscopy and colonoscopy, which showed no evidence of upper GI bleed or deep venous thrombosis. The patient is currently receiving heparin infusion, and his INR is in the low end of the therapeutic range.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued GI bleed: The patient's ongoing maroon stools and decreased hemoglobin levels indicate a persistent GI bleed, which may lead to further anemia, hypovolemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Deep venous thrombosis: The patient's recent lower extremity ultrasound (LENS) shows non-occlusive thrombosis of the right popliteal vein, which may lead to further clot propagation and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's massive PE may lead to further pulmonary complications, such as hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels (1.1 mg/dL) and decreased urine output may indicate renal failure, which may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate acid levels may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to further complications, such as sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and steroid use may lead to further hyperglycemia, which may increase his risk of complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease, is admitted to the ICU with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient has a massive clot burden on computed tomography angiography (CTA) with significant hypoxia, and evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG). He has been extubated and is much improved.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient has maroon-colored stools, which could be a sign of GI bleeding. The presence of heparin drip and recent lysis may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low CVPs suggest hypovolemia, which may be related to the massive PE.
3. Renal failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, which is within his normal range.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to chronic steroid use.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration due to chronic steroid use and critical illness.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

The patient is receiving heparin drip for DVT prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient is also receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU. The patient's family has been informed, and an ICU consent has been signed."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 155/48 mmHg, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient has continued to have maroon bowel movements, and a gastrointestinal (GI) consultation was obtained, which recommended a negative gastroscopy (NGL) and upper endoscopy tomorrow morning. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable at 27%, and the patient has a positive lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENIs) showing non-occlusive thrombosis of the right popliteal vein and no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower extremity.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.8, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 240. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 26 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) is 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose is 203 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of hyperkalemia (high potassium) with a level of 5.4 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's maroon bowel movements and positive lower endoscopy findings suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's ongoing pulmonary embolism can lead to respiratory failure, right ventricular strain, and cardiovascular complications.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's positive LENIs and prophylactic anticoagulation therapy suggest the risk of deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome, and long-term sequelae.
6. Infection: The patient's fever of unknown origin and positive laboratory results suggest the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's pulmonary embolism and acute renal failure suggest the risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock."

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure. After lysis and rapid improvement, the patient developed slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely due to inflamed colon. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated with therapeutic heparin, holding off on coumadin and filter due to persistent GIB. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they continue to require close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's slow GIB may lead to further bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pulmonary embolism recurrence: Despite therapeutic heparin, there is a risk of PE recurrence, which could lead to further respiratory failure and mortality.
3. Inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation: The patient's IBD may worsen, leading to increased inflammation, bleeding, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Sepsis: The patient's GIB and IBD may lead to sepsis, which could cause multi-organ failure and increased mortality.
5. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's ongoing GIB may lead to hypovolemic shock, which could require urgent intervention to prevent further complications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's PE and respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory compromise, requiring close monitoring and potential intubation.
7. Infection: The patient's GIB and IBD may lead to infection, which could cause further complications and increased mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Maintain therapeutic heparin to prevent PE recurrence.
3. Hold off on coumadin and filter until the GIB resolves.
4. Increase prednisone to 40 mg daily to manage IBD.
5. Consider additional GI medications to manage IBD and GIB.
6. Restart diet and monitor for signs of malnutrition.
7. Monitor for signs of sepsis and hypovolemic shock.
8. Consider intubation if respiratory failure worsens.
9. Monitor for signs of infection and consider antibiotics if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) who presented with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure. After lysis and rapid improvement, the patient is now experiencing slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely due to inflamed colon. The patient has undergone an endoscopy (EGD) with normal findings, and sputum culture revealed normal flora.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/88 mmHg. The patient is receiving therapeutic heparin and pantoprazole for GIB and PE, respectively. The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.1 g/dL, and the patient is receiving transfusions.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.8, platelet count of 240, and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 13 and aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 15.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potential need for blood transfusions.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may recur, leading to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which could lead to liver failure and potential need for liver transplantation.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) may indicate a coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to malnutrition, which could worsen the patient's overall condition.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and potentially life-threatening complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease, admitted one week ago for a massive pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis. The patient has been experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, with maroon stool and stable blood pressure. He is receiving heparin therapy due to the severity of the pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. His respiratory support consists of a multi-lumen catheter and oxygen delivery device.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, overweight and obese. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal pulse and blood pressure. His respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with no wheezing or rhonchi.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 240 K/uL. His renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L and a calcium level of 8.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary embolism. He is being transfused and maintained on heparin therapy, with close monitoring of his PTT levels. A colonoscopy is planned for tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Acute kidney injury due to ongoing hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hyperkalemia, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
4. Pulmonary embolism, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
5. Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia, due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Gastrointestinal perforation or bleeding, leading to peritonitis and sepsis.
7. Renal failure, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
8. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to electrolyte imbalances and decreased cardiac output.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal management of his conditions."

   Following administration of tpa lysis for PE, patient has developed
   ongoing maroon stools. Hct has fallen from 40 to 30. Hemodynamically
   stable and asx. EGD shows no upper GI bleeding. S/p colonoscopy in [**5-2**]
   showing inflammation of the colon.
   - per GI, increased prednisone to 40mg daily
   - Mesalamine 500 mg PO BID
   - cont to monitor Q4hr hcts and transfuse for <30
   # Type 2 Diabetes: Hyperglycemia given steroid use.
   - HISS tightened, added glargine 10units QHS
   - monitor glucose levels closeley
   # HTN. Normotensive-will continue to hold home anti-HTNs given GIB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, and diverticulosis with a history of colectomy. He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE. The patient has undergone lysis and is currently being treated with heparin for anticoagulation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.9°C, HR 63 bpm, BP 127/86 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with no signs of hypotension or tachycardia.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on RA (respiratory assist) and has good oxygen saturation.
* Gastrointestinal (GI) status: The patient has maroon stools and a falling HCT (hematocrit), likely secondary to TPA lysis, heparin, and/or Crohn's disease. The patient is being monitored for GI bleeding and has been prescribed mesalamine 500 mg PO BID and increased prednisone to 40 mg daily.
* Renal function: The patient's recent creatinine (Cr) levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, and his current value is within his normal range.
* Electrolytes: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.
* Blood products: The patient has received 2 units of blood and is being monitored for further transfusions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of maroon stools.
2. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of maroon stools.
3. Renal failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, and his current value is within his normal range. However, the patient may be at risk for further renal failure due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of maroon stools.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is at risk for further respiratory failure due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of maroon stools.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications due to the anticoagulation therapy and the presence of maroon stools.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including bleeding, GI bleeding, renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management of his anticoagulation therapy, GI bleeding, and renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, and diverticulosis who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE. He was transferred to the floor yesterday night and is currently experiencing maroon stools and falling HCT. The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has been experiencing maroon stools since anticoagulation started, which may be secondary to TPA lysis, heparin gtt, and/or Crohn's disease. The patient's HCT has remained stable overnight with 4 Units of PRBCs.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient had a massive clot burden visible by CTA and s/p right ventricular strain on echo. He was s/p lysis and is now hemodynamically stable.
3. Crohn's Disease: The patient has ongoing maroon stools and HCT has fallen from 40 to 30. EGD shows no upper GI bleeding, and colonoscopy showed inflammation of the colon.
4. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient has hyperglycemia given steroid use, and his glucose levels are being closely monitored.
5. HTN: The patient is normotensive, but his home anti-HTNs are being held given GIB.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, which is within his range of normal.
7. FEN: The patient is NPO, and his electrolytes are being repleted.

Potential medical complications include:

1. Continued GI bleeding: The patient's maroon stools may continue, and he may require further transfusions.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient may be at risk for further pulmonary embolism given his history of submassive PE.
3. Crohn's disease flares: The patient's ongoing maroon stools and inflammation of the colon may indicate ongoing Crohn's disease flares.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen given his steroid use and diabetes.
5. Renal failure: The patient's Cr levels may continue to rise, indicating worsening renal failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced given his NPO status and repletion of electrolytes.
7. Infection: The patient may be at risk for infection given his immunocompromised state and ongoing medical issues.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Colonoscopy to evaluate the extent of GI bleeding
2. Continue heparin gtt for now, with consideration of coumadin once bleeding is resolved
3. Monitor resp status
4. Continue prednisone and Mesalamine for Crohn's disease
5. Monitor glucose levels closely and adjust HISS as needed
6. Renally dose all meds
7. Follow Cr levels and adjust treatment as needed
8. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) following lysis. He is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is awaiting further diagnostic procedures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with a soft and non-tender abdomen, and bowel sounds present. His extremities are trace edematous, and his skin is warm.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2-9.5 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 261-309 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, which is slightly elevated.

The patient is receiving heparin infusions and has been prescribed protonix, prednisone, and mesalamine. He is also receiving insulin for glycemic control and has a nasogastric tube in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his GIB and the use of anticoagulant therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's PE and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute may put him at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and potential for further bleeding may put him at risk for acute renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and potential for further bleeding may put him at risk for infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decrease due to his GIB and anticoagulant therapy, potentially leading to thrombocytopenia.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, and further monitoring is necessary to prevent hyperkalemia.
7. Surgical complications: The patient's massive PE and potential for further bleeding may require surgical intervention, which carries its own set of risks and complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further diagnostic procedures, including a repeat colonoscopy, are necessary to determine the source of his GIB."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease, who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) after lysis. He is now expected to develop gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is awaiting further diagnostic procedures.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and his cardiovascular examination is normal. His respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, and his abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 309 K/uL, and platelet count of 261 K/uL. His creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 4.2 mEq/L. His liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and his troponin-T level is slightly elevated.

The patient is receiving heparin infusions for anticoagulation, and his blood pressure is being monitored closely. He is also receiving proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has a Foley catheter in place for urinary drainage.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): suspect colon, awaiting repeat colonoscopy, and continuing prednisone and mesalamine.
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): awaiting repeat imaging to rule out residual clot, and continuing heparin infusions.
* Renal failure: resolved.
* Hyperkalemia: stable.
* Fever: unknown origin, awaiting further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding complications due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and anticoagulation therapy.
* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism (PE) and potential hypoxia.
* Renal failure due to inadequate fluid management and potential sepsis.
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive devices.
* Cardiac complications due to potential hypotension and arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications due to potential hypoxia and sepsis.

Given the patient's critical condition and complex medical history, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to
   submassive PE. Transferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with
   continued maroon stools and falling HCT.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
   Ulceration and erythema from the transverse colon to cecum compatible
   with Crohn's disease
   Blood clots in the whole colon.  In the terminal ileum, we found normal
   mucosa.  No blood clot and red blood were noticed in the terminal
   ileum.  The stool in the terminal ileum was yellow.  The G.I. bleeding,
   therefore, most likely occurred in the colon.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to
   submassive PE. Transferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with
   continued maroon stools and falling HCT.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
   Ulceration and erythema from the transverse colon to cecum compatible
   with Crohn's disease
   Blood clots in the whole colon.  In the terminal ileum, we found normal
   mucosa.  No blood clot and red blood were noticed in the terminal
   ileum.  The stool in the terminal ileum was yellow.  The G.I. bleeding,
   therefore, most likely occurred in the colon.
   Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
   - IVC filter  by IR in am

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, on steroids, and a recent colectomy. He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE. The patient has been transferred to the floor and is currently experiencing maroon stools and falling HCT.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.28, which is slightly acidic.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a range of 140-157/91-95 mmHg. His heart rate is 69 bpm, and his rhythm is sinus.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has ongoing maroon stools, which is likely secondary to TPA lysis, heparin, and/or Crohn's disease. The patient's HCT has fallen from 40 to 30, and he has received 4 units of PRBCs.
* Renal: The patient's recent Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, which is within his normal range.
* Endocrine: The patient has hyperglycemia due to steroid use, and his HISS has been tightened. He has been started on glargine 10 units QHS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing maroon stools and falling HCT suggest ongoing bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of submassive PE, and his current condition suggests that he may still have a high risk of developing further pulmonary emboli.
* Renal failure: The patient's Cr levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, which is within his normal range. However, his recent use of TPA lysis and heparin may increase his risk of developing renal failure.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia due to steroid use can lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis and increased risk of infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IVC filter placement
* Discontinuation of heparin gtt for at least one hour
* Active T+S and crossmatch for 6 units
* Q6h HCTs and transfusion for <30
* Follow-up with GI and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for further recommendations
* Continue prednisone 40mg daily and Mesalamine 500mg PO BID
* Monitor glucose levels closely and adjust HISS as needed
* Hold home anti-HTNs given GIB
* Renally dose all meds and follow Cr levels
* Provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Monitor for signs of VAP and adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 56 year old male with DMII, HTN, crohn's disease, on
   steroids, diverticulosis s/p colectomy X 2, who was admitted to the
   MICU on [**7-29**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to
   submassive PE. Transferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with
   continued maroon stools and falling HCT.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
   Ulceration and erythema from the transverse colon to cecum compatible
   with Crohn's disease
   Blood clots in the whole colon.  In the terminal ileum, we found normal
   mucosa.  No blood clot and red blood were noticed in the terminal
   ileum.  The stool in the terminal ileum was yellow.  The G.I. bleeding,
   therefore, most likely occurred in the colon.
   Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
   - IVC filter  by IR in am
   - Hct 30, 31, 32
   - no blood needed

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a complex medical history, including DMII, HTN, Crohn's disease, and a recent colectomy. He was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to submassive PE. The patient has ongoing maroon stools and falling HCT, suggesting ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient has undergone a colonoscopy, which revealed active Crohn's disease, but no evidence of current bleeding. The bleeding is likely occurring in the colon, and the patient has been recommended to receive an IVC filter and continue systemic anticoagulation.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 140/91 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His respiratory support includes a nasal cannula, and he is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin of 30.1 g/dL, platelet count of 309,000/uL, and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL. His inflammatory markers are elevated, with a white blood cell count of 9.5, and his liver function tests are mildly elevated.

The patient's plan includes continued anticoagulation with heparin, bridging to warfarin, and ongoing monitoring of his hemoglobin and platelet count. He will also continue to receive prednisone and mesalamine for his Crohn's disease, and his blood pressure will be closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Development of renal failure, which could worsen his existing creatinine levels.
3. Progression of his Crohn's disease, which could lead to further gastrointestinal complications.
4. Pulmonary embolism, which could worsen his respiratory status.
5. Bleeding complications from the IVC filter, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to promptly address any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's colitis, who presented with massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently experiencing slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to active Crohn's disease. The patient has undergone lysis and has an IVC filter in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/75 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 98% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 309 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.6 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding, other (GIB)
* Fever, unknown origin (FUO)
* Renal failure, acute (ARF)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium)
* Pulmonary embolism, acute (PE)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing heparin and starting warfarin for anticoagulation
* Continuing prednisone and mesalamine for Crohn's disease
* Following up with gastrointestinal consultation
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and sepsis

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure
* Sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death
* Renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalance and acidosis
* Pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and death
* Hyperkalemia, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's colitis, who has developed a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and slow gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) from active Crohn's disease. The patient has undergone lysis and has had an IVC filter placed to prevent further embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/75 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination is normal, with a sinus rhythm. The respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds, and the abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 309 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 140 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient is receiving heparin and warfarin for anticoagulation, as well as prednisone and mesalamine for Crohn's disease. The patient is also receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pulmonary embolism recurrence
* Deep vein thrombosis
* Stress ulceration
* VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia)
* Infection due to active Crohn's disease
* Development of bleeding diathesis due to anticoagulation therapy
* Potential need for blood transfusions due to anemia

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."
