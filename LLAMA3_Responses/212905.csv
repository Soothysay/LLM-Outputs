   #.  Sepsis: Bandemia.  Likely from pneumonia given large inflitrate on
   CXR.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated
   hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess or perforation.
   Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  On levophed and neo.  Blood cultures
   positive for GNR.

   - continue vanc/zosyn/flagyl
   - pressors to keep MAP > 65
   - Continue IVF bolus as tolerated
   #. Respiratory Failure: Sedation and ventilation.  Underlying etiology
   likely pna vs aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Vent settings as tolerated
   #. A fib with RVR: On arriveal rate in 120s and ST depressions.  On
   Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.  Likely also tachycardic [**2-28**] sepsis.  Give
   Metoprolol 5mg IV, repeated for decreased HR, with drop in BP.
   - treat underlying sepsis with IVF and pressors
   - If returns to RVR will schedule metoprolol 10mg IV q6h
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Elevated troponin: Trop 0.09 and stable.  CK-MB normal.  Unknown if

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (a fib), and coumadin therapy, who was found down and intubated upon admission to the ICU. He has sepsis with bandemia, likely caused by pneumonia, and is receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and IV fluids. He also has respiratory failure, with a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia, and is being ventilated. The patient has a history of incarcerated hernia without repair, and a recent CT scan showed no evidence of abscess or perforation. He has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible demand ischemia, and is being treated with rate control measures. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, likely caused by prerenal etiology in sepsis, and is being monitored for trends in creatinine levels and urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely to cause organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to further increases in creatinine levels and potentially requiring dialysis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and vasopressors may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. SBO: The patient's history of incarcerated hernia and recent CT scan showing evidence of SBO may lead to further complications, including bowel obstruction and perforation.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to further complications, including delirium and increased risk of falls.
8. C-spine injury: The patient's history of trauma and unclear prior symptoms may lead to further complications, including C-spine injury and spinal cord damage."

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (a fib), and has been found down with sepsis and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.6°C (101.5°F)
* Heart rate: 105 bpm (99-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 96/55 mmHg (64 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (21-28 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, a respiratory rate of 16, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient is also receiving dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

The patient has a large infiltrate on the chest X-ray (CXR), which is likely due to pneumonia. Blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNR), and the patient's sputum is positive for GPC. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, and is also receiving ciprofloxacin.

The patient has a history of CHF, and has been on coumadin for atrial fibrillation. However, the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is low, and the patient is at risk for bleeding. The patient is also at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis and hypotension.

The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.09 ng/mL, which may indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows ST depressions in V5-V6, which may also indicate ischemia.

The patient has a history of incarcerated hernia, which has not been repaired. The patient's computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO), and the patient is at risk for perforation.

The patient's mental status is altered, and the patient is difficult to assess due to sedation. The patient's CT head is negative, but the patient is at risk for ischemic stroke or toxic/metabolic abnormalities due to sepsis.

The patient's code status is confirmed as full code, and the patient's emergency contact is listed as [**Name (NI) 5463**] and [**Name (NI) 10741**].

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ failure, such as AKI, respiratory failure, or cardiac failure
* Pneumonia-related complications, such as respiratory failure or empyema
* Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, ischemia, or arrhythmias
* Renal failure or AKI due to sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications
* Small bowel obstruction-related complications, such as perforation or bowel ischemia
* Hernia-related complications, such as incarceration or strangulation
* Ischemic stroke or toxic/metabolic abnormalities due to sepsis or hypotension
* Bleeding complications due to low INR or coumadin therapy
* Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to mechanical ventilation."

   blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive GNR.  Urine without evidence of
   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl, now
   on Vanc/cefepime/cipro/Flagyl.  Given the culture data of pan-sensitive
   E.Coli and GPC on sputum, we will simplify to vanc/cipro.  Given that

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, pneumonia, and small bowel obstruction. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and incarcerated hernia. He was found down and unresponsive, with a positive dicrotic notch on his ECG. He was intubated and sedated, and his condition has been deteriorating despite treatment.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, and has been on pressor support with norepinephrine and phenylephrine. His blood cultures have shown pan-sensitive E. coli, and his sputum cultures have shown GNR and GPC. He has also had a CT scan, which showed evidence of small bowel obstruction and pneumonia.

The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure, elevated troponin levels, and altered mental status. He has been on sedation and has been difficult to assess. His code status is do not escalate care, and his HCP has agreed to this.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue to progress, and he may require further treatment, including antibiotics and pressor support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to continue to worsen, and he may require further treatment, including antibiotics and oxygen therapy.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction may require surgical intervention, and he may require further treatment, including antibiotics and supportive care.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may require further treatment, including dialysis and supportive care.
5. Elevated troponin levels: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate cardiac damage, and he may require further treatment, including medications to reduce cardiac stress.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may require further treatment, including sedation and supportive care.
7. DVT prophylaxis: The patient may require further treatment, including anticoagulant medications and supportive care, to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and pressor support as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's condition closely for signs of worsening sepsis, pneumonia, or small bowel obstruction.
3. Consider further treatment, including surgery, for the patient's small bowel obstruction.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further treatment, including dialysis, if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and consider further treatment, including medications to reduce cardiac stress, if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider further treatment, including sedation and supportive care, if necessary.
7. Consider further treatment, including anticoagulant medications and supportive care, to prevent deep vein thrombosis."

   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend will be here
   today.  The patient consented to intubation in the ED and the HCP has
   wanted to treat
reversible processes
.  On a prior admission, Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical intervention
   and not wanting escalation of care.  He did not formally make himself
   DNR/DNI.  Will meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
 HCP here in early afternoon.  He agrees to patient being DNR and not
   escalating care.  However, he would like to maintain current level of
   care until he can contact some of the patient
s cousins.  [**Name (NI) **] agreed to
   being called tomorrow for further update.
   #.  Sepsis: Has progression on CXR and is still requiring extensive
   pressor support.  Source likely his pneumonia given GNR in sputum and
   blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive GNR.  Urine without evidence of
   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl, now
   on Vanc/cefepime/cipro/Flagyl.  Given the culture data of pan-sensitive
   E.Coli and GPC on sputum, we will simplify to vanc/cipro.  Given that
   his HCP does not want to escalate care, we will give no further fluid
   boluses and wean the pressors as tolerated.
   - f/u more recent blood cultures.
   - Abx: vanc/cipro
   - pressors to keep MAP > 65, weaning Levophed as much as tolerated.
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 2.0 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Monitor UOP.  If it drops off acutely, we may consider giving further
   boluses of fluid.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. Elevated troponin: Trop 0.09, last measured on [**11-23**] was 0.02.
   CK-MB normal.  Unknown if symptommatic.  Has not progressed further and
   we are not treating at this time.
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.
   - Clear when mental status improves
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - carefully monitor fluid status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend will be here
   today.  The patient consented to intubation in the ED and the HCP has
   wanted to treat
reversible processes
.  On a prior admission, Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical intervention
   and not wanting escalation of care.  He did not formally make himself
   DNR/DNI.  Will meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
 HCP here in early afternoon.  He agrees to patient being DNR and not
   escalating care.  However, he would like to maintain current level of
   care until he can contact some of the patient
s cousins.  [**Name (NI) **] agreed to
   being called tomorrow for further update.
   #.  Sepsis: Has progression on CXR and is still requiring extensive
   pressor support.  Source likely his pneumonia given GNR in sputum and
   blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive GNR.  Urine without evidence of
   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl, now
   on Vanc/cefepime/cipro/Flagyl.  Given the culture data of pan-sensitive
   E.Coli and GPC on sputum, we will simplify to vanc/cipro.  Given that
   his HCP does not want to escalate care, we will give no further fluid
   boluses and wean the pressors as tolerated.
   - f/u more recent blood cultures.
   - Abx: vanc/cipro
   - pressors to keep MAP > 65, weaning Levophed as much as tolerated.
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 2.0 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Monitor UOP.  If it drops off acutely, we may consider giving further
   boluses of fluid.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. Elevated troponin: Trop 0.09, last measured on [**11-23**] was 0.02.
   CK-MB normal.  Unknown if symptommatic.  Has not progressed further and
   we are not treating at this time.
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.
   - Clear when mental status improves

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis. He has a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia for which he refused surgery. He is currently intubated and sedated, and his vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.6°F (39.2°C)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm
* Blood pressure: 113/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient has a severe pneumonia, as evident from the chest X-ray, and is requiring extensive pressor support. His blood cultures show pan-sensitive E. coli, and he is being treated with vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. His urine culture is pending.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his creatinine level is 2.0 mg/dL. He is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, with a urine output of 30-40 mL per hour. His troponin level is elevated at 0.09 ng/mL, but his CK-MB level is normal.

The patient has a small bowel obstruction, which is being managed conservatively. He has a history of incarceration hernia, which is now reduced, but a new inguinal hernia has developed.

The patient's mental status is altered, and he is difficult to assess due to sedation and toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking coumadin, which is being held.

The patient's code status is DNR, and his disposition is pending a plan from his healthcare proxy. He is currently requiring ICU-level support and is not to be escalated.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Progressive sepsis and organ dysfunction
2. Respiratory failure and worsening hypoxia
3. Renal failure and need for dialysis
4. Cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
6. Neurological decline and potential for ischemic stroke
7. Worsening of small bowel obstruction and potential need for surgery
8. Development of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis and organ dysfunction with antibiotics and pressor support.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider increasing oxygen support if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with fluid restriction and diuretics.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and consider adjusting his medication regimen as necessary.
5. Consider performing a nasogastric tube insertion to decompress the patient's small bowel.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider performing a head CT if his mental status worsens.
7. Consider consulting with a surgeon to discuss the patient's small bowel obstruction and potential need for surgery.
8. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and consider adjusting his fluid and medication regimen as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

.  On a prior admission, Mr.
   [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical intervention
   and not wanting escalation of care.  He did not formally make himself
   DNR/DNI.  Will meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Has progression on CXR and is still requiring extensive
   pressor support.  Source likely his pneumonia given GNR in sputum and
   blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive GNR.  Urine without evidence of
   infection.  Recent h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without
   evidence of abscess or perforation.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl.  On

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, intubated and mechanically ventilated. He has a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia, which was not repaired. He has been admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. His laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, and his chest X-ray shows diffuse opacification involving much of the left lung, consistent with widespread pneumonia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the progressive pneumonia, and he may require further sedation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is progressing, and he may require continued pressor support and antibiotics.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely due to prerenal etiology in sepsis, and he may require further monitoring and treatment.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sepsis, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of incarcerated hernia, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for small bowel obstruction.
6. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and he may require further treatment and monitoring.
7. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate acute coronary syndrome, and he may require further evaluation and treatment.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and pressor support to treat sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust sedation and ventilation as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Evaluate the patient's mental status and adjust sedation and treatment as necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for small bowel obstruction.
6. Monitor the patient's heart function and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment for acute coronary syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.  Unable to clear collar

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and incarcerated hernia.
* He was found down and is currently in the ICU with sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
* He has a poor prognosis and has agreed to DNR (do not resuscitate) and no escalation of care.
* He is receiving vanc/cipro antibiotics for pan-sensitive E. Coli sepsis, and his blood cultures have shown no evidence of infection.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient is at risk for continued sepsis and organ dysfunction, particularly in the setting of his underlying critical aortic stenosis.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he may require further ventilatory support or intubation.
3. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's AF is likely to continue, and he may require further management with rate control medications.
4. **Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:** The patient's Cr is stabilized at 1.9, but he is at risk for further kidney injury due to his critical aortic stenosis and sepsis.
5. **Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO):** The patient has a new inguinal hernia and a SBO, which may worsen if not managed promptly.
6. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient's altered mental status may persist due to sepsis, toxic/metabolic abnormalities, or underlying brain injury.
7. **Cervical Spine Precautions:** The patient's C-spine is at risk for further injury due to his altered mental status and unknown trauma.
8. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's CHF and critical aortic stenosis may worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue vanc/cipro antibiotics for sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further ventilatory support or intubation if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medications.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider further management with diuretics or hemodialysis if necessary.
5. Manage the patient's SBO with bowel rest and fluids, and consider further management with surgery if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's altered mental status closely and consider further management with sedation or anticonvulsants if necessary.
7. Continue cervical spine precautions and monitor the patient's C-spine closely for further injury.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider further management with diuretics, vasodilators, or cardiac catheterization if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yoM h/o CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and incarcerated hernia
   for which he refused surgery found down, now with pna and sepsis.
   #.  Goals of care: The patient
s HCP and close friend as well as family
   visited and have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR.  They likely
   will talk today and probably will make pt [**Name (NI) 617**].  On a prior admission,
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10749**] was very clear about not wanting aggressive surgical
   intervention and not wanting escalation of care.
   - Meet today to discuss poor prognosis and goals of care.
   #.  Sepsis: Continued fever, currently requiring pressor support,
   however no further escalation of care.  Source likely his pneumonia
   given GNR in sputum and blood.  Blood shows pan-sensitive E. Coli,
   antibiotics cipro/vanc.  Urine without evidence of infection.  Recent
   h/o incarcerated hernia without repair, CT without evidence of abscess
   or perforation.
   - f/u more blood cultures
   - Continue vanc/cipro, plan to d/c vanc when sputum GPC speciation
   returns
   #. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 overnight, most recent
   ABG shows poor oxygenation.  Underlying etiology likely the progressive
   pneumonia.
   #. A fib with RVR: Rate in 120s and ST depressions.  We are holding off
   on beta blockers in the setting of requiring pressor support for
   sepsis, though he is on Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home.
   - Hold coumadin
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline
   1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour despite being flooded with many
   liters of fluid.  He is likely coping poorly with sepsis because of his
   critical aortic stenosis.  No muddy-brown casts on UA yesterday.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   #. SBO: Previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal
   hernia. CT with evidence of SBO.  Surgery aware.  He has refused
   surgery in the past and there is no plans for surgery even if hernia
   worsens.
   #. Altered Mental Status: Found down, unclear prior symptoms.  Concern
   for trauma although CT head negative.  H/o a fib, INR low, concern for
   ischemic stroke, however global AMS, no obvious focal lesions.  Likely
   [**2-28**] toxic/metabolic abnormalities from sepsis.  Now on sedation and
   difficult to assess.
   - Wean sedation and monitor for changes
   #. C-Spine precautions: Found down, unknown trauma.  Collared by EMS,
   unable to clear [**2-28**] AMS.  CT C-spine negative.  Unable to clear collar
   given AMS.
   #. CHF/AS: Last EF 60-70%, severe AS.  Has refused surgery in the
   past.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   #. FEN: NPO, repleate lytes
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Pantoprazole 40mg Q24hrs for stress-ulcer prophylaxis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and incarcerated hernia. He was found down and diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. His condition has been deteriorating, and his HCP and close friend have agreed to no escalation of care and DNR. The patient's goals of care are to avoid aggressive surgical intervention and not to escalate his care.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Requiring increased FiO2 and pressor support for sepsis, with poor oxygenation and underlying etiology likely progressive pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, with ST depressions and holding off on beta blockers due to pressor support for sepsis.
* Renal: Acute on chronic renal failure, with Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline 1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour, despite being flooded with many liters of fluid.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, likely due to sepsis, with concern for trauma although CT head negative, and H/o a fib and INR low, concern for ischemic stroke.
* Gastrointestinal: SBO, with previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal hernia, and CT with evidence of SBO.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Continued fever, requiring pressor support, and likely source is pneumonia, given GNR in sputum and blood.
2. Respiratory Failure: Requiring increased FiO2 and pressor support, with poor oxygenation and underlying etiology likely progressive pneumonia.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: With rapid ventricular rate and ST depressions, holding off on beta blockers due to pressor support for sepsis.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: With Cr stabilized at 1.9 from baseline 1.4-1.8 and UOP down to 30ccs per hour, despite being flooded with many liters of fluid.
5. Altered Mental Status: Likely due to sepsis, with concern for trauma although CT head negative, and H/o a fib and INR low, concern for ischemic stroke.
6. SBO: With previous incisional hernia now reduced, but new inguinal hernia, and CT with evidence of SBO.
7. Ischemic Stroke: Concern due to altered mental status, H/o a fib and INR low, and low platelet count.
8. Inguinal Hernia: With new inguinal hernia, and CT with evidence of SBO.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vanc/cipro antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Wean sedation and monitor for changes in altered mental status.
3. Trend Cr and rehydrate the patient to address acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Avoid nephrotoxic medications and consider renal dose adjustments.
5. Monitor for signs of ischemic stroke and consider imaging studies.
6. Consider surgical consultation for inguinal hernia, but patient has refused surgery in the past.
7. Continue pain management with fentanyl and consider alternative pain management options.
8. Monitor for signs of sepsis and respiratory failure, and consider adjusting ventilator settings as needed."
