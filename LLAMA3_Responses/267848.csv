   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   34 here.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to the hospital with sepsis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 141/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 427 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 31.4 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 288 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 164 IU/L. Her troponin level is <0.01 ng/mL, indicating low cardiac troponin levels.

The patient's medical history includes meningioma, seizure disorder, and previous imaging studies that show stable findings. She has been started on levo, ceftaz, and flagyl antibiotics, which will cover most GI and uro sources of infection. However, her elevated pancreatic enzymes suggest a biliary obstructive picture, and ERCP is planned for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She may require continued respiratory support, and weaning of ventilation may be challenging.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by a combination of factors, including cholangitis, urosepsis, and seeding of the urine. She may require continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for signs of septic shock.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to infection, hypotension, or other factors. She may require continued sedation and close monitoring for signs of improvement or deterioration.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's low troponin levels suggest low cardiac troponin levels, but cardiac ischemia or infarction cannot be ruled out. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and ECG changes is necessary.
5. Meningioma-related complications: The patient's meningioma may be related to her altered mental status, and close monitoring for signs of worsening or complications is necessary.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to complications such as septic shock, organ failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be related to infection, hypotension, or other factors. Close monitoring for signs of neurological deterioration is necessary.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case requiring close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications. She requires continued antibiotic therapy, respiratory support, and close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical history."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   34 here.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - narrow abx as culture data and clinical status allows
   - ercp following and planning on ERCP in the AM
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   - BCx, UCx, Sputum Cx
   - f/u OSH speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #. respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Latest gas 7.44/27/95/19. Will
   likely be able to extubate after ERCP.
   - cont PSV at 15/5 for tonight
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - hold sedation and wean ventilation as tolerated following ERCP
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  However, an event while hypotensive is possible.
   Heparinizing her would be risky at this time given upcoming ERCP,
   expecially with trop trending down.
   - ekg now
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. seizure disorder: There are notes indicated increased seizure
   acitivity in the weeks preceeding this event.  Her imaging is felt
   stable from [**2153**].  EEG did not show seizure.  She was initiated on
   keppra at [**Hospital3 140**].
   - continue keppra
   .
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.
   - follow
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.
   .
   #. AMS: presumably related to infection, though seizure could have been
   involved.  Currently withdrawing all extremities.
   - wean sedation after ERCP and assess mental status.
   - consider involving neurosurg if persistant altered mental status,
   however would need high suspicion to tap shunt

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined the patient, reviewe her history and labs and was
   present for the key portion of the services provided. I agree with Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 803**]
s note above and her plan of care.  The patient is intubated due
   to hypotension from GNR sepsis. The origin of the sepsis is either
   urosepsis or cholangitis, with certain clinical elements favoring
   each.  ERCP shows no CBD obstruction, and stent placed.  Pt remains on
   broad spectrum antibiotics and is now off pressors and vent status
   shows good ABG
s on only a low level of PSV.  The limiting factor now
   is the patient
s mental status
 she
s still rather unresponsive,
   though seems improving now that Fentanyl is off. She needs to have OSH
   right femoral lines removed today, whether she is extubated or not, and
   the latter will depend on how much she wakes up.  Family visited today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I have examined the patient, reviewe her history and labs and was
   present for the key portion of the services provided. I agree with Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 803**]
s note above and her plan of care.  The patient is intubated due
   to hypotension from GNR sepsis. The origin of the sepsis is either
   urosepsis or cholangitis, with certain clinical elements favoring
   each.  ERCP shows no CBD obstruction, and stent placed.  Pt remains on
   broad spectrum antibiotics and is now off pressors and vent status
   shows good ABG
s on only a low level of PSV.  The limiting factor now
   is the patient
s mental status
 she
s still rather unresponsive,
   though seems improving now that Fentanyl is off. She needs to have OSH
   right femoral lines removed today, whether she is extubated or not, and
   the latter will depend on how much she wakes up.  Family visited today.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to the hospital with sepsis. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and is being treated for GNR sepsis, which is likely originating from either urosepsis or cholangitis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes, which may indicate a biliary obstructive picture. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a regular rhythm, and her troponin levels are trending down, suggesting that the patient's cardiac event was likely due to demand ischemia.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with oxygenation well maintained on PSV with minimal support. The patient's mental status is still altered, but seems to be improving after discontinuing fentanyl.

The patient's physical examination reveals trace pedal edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, and bilateral antecubital erythema and skin break on the right. The patient's neurologic examination shows that she is intubated and sedated, not following commands, and withdrawing all four extremities to pain.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's GNR sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, and coagulopathy.
2. Biliary obstruction: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests (LFTs) suggest a possible biliary obstructive picture, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's troponin levels are trending down, but the patient's cardiac event may still require close monitoring and management.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but may still require close monitoring and management, especially after ERCP.
5. Neurologic complications: The patient's altered mental status and withdrawal to pain may indicate a risk of neurologic complications, including seizures, and may require further evaluation and management.
6. Infection: The patient's GNR sepsis may lead to further infections, including urinary tract infections, and may require ongoing antibiotic therapy.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring suggest that the patient may be at risk for hemodynamic instability, which may require close monitoring and management.

The patient's plan of care includes continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, ERCP, and close monitoring of her respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic status."

   The major papilla appeared prominent and was bludging.
   A single non-bleeding periampullary diverticulum with small opening was
   found at the major papilla.
   Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome
   after a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in
   complete opacification.
   A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD
   measuring 13-14 mm. There were no filling defects or strictures seen.
   A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Dark, clear bile drainined
   from the common bile duct after the sphincterotomy was performed. There
   was no sludge or pus seen.
   A 7cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully with
   excellent drainage of dark, clear bile after it was placed.
   Recommendations: The findings of the ERCP are consistent with biliary
   obstruction, but not cholangitis. Her obstruction may be due to
   papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. This could first be
   evaluated with MRCP as an outpatient.
   She will need a repeat ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy.

   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to

   MICU ATTENDUING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Dr [**Known lastname 12663**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9827**]
s note and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  I have also spoken with the
   pt
s daughter.
   The patient remains hemodynamically stable and her blood cultures show
   EColi and Klebsiella, only the EColi of which was also cultured in the
   urine.  Though the ERCP showed not evidence of cholangitis, it did show
   biliary obstruction to the extent a stent was placed.  This, along with
   elevated amylase and LFT
s make me believe her sepsis could be both
   biliary and urosepsis.  The plan is to convert antibiotics to Cipro
   which should cover both organisms.
   Her resp status is stable and if it weren
t for her obtundation, she
   be ready to extubate.  The main diff dx of her obtundation is anoxic
   encephalopathy, sedation from Keppra, electrical status, seeding of her
   VP shunt, etc.  If she
s no better in 24 hr I would pursue a vigorous
   neuro assessment.

   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   19.5.  Etiology appears most likely to be urine.

   MICU ATTENDUING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Dr [**Known lastname 12663**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9827**]
s note and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  I have also spoken with the
   pt
s daughter.
   The patient remains hemodynamically stable and her blood cultures show
   EColi and Klebsiella, only the EColi of which was also cultured in the
   urine.  Though the ERCP showed not evidence of cholangitis, it did show
   biliary obstruction to the extent a stent was placed.  This, along with
   elevated amylase and LFT
s make me believe her sepsis could be both
   biliary and urosepsis.  The plan is to convert antibiotics to Cipro
   which should cover both organisms.
   Her resp status is stable and if it weren
t for her obtundation, she
   be ready to extubate.  The main diff dx of her obtundation is anoxic
   encephalopathy, sedation from Keppra, electrical status, seeding of her
   VP shunt, etc.  If she
s no better in 24 hr I would pursue a vigorous
   neuro assessment.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are noted:

**Summary:**

The patient, an 87-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a biliary obstruction but no evidence of cholangitis. The patient's blood cultures grew E. coli and Klebsiella, with E. coli also cultured in the urine. She was initially treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, but the antibiotics were converted to ciprofloxacin due to the pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia. The patient remains hemodynamically stable, but her respiratory status is stable, and she is at risk for extubation once her mental status improves.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's sepsis may progress to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction (SOFA score > 2) or septic shock, which would require immediate attention and aggressive management.
2. **Biliary Obstruction:** The patient's biliary obstruction may lead to further complications, such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, or biliary cirrhosis, if not managed properly.
3. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):** The patient's UTI may lead to further complications, such as pyelonephritis, kidney damage, or sepsis, if not managed properly.
4. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications, such as respiratory acidosis, hypoxemia, or respiratory arrest, if not managed properly.
5. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of underlying neurological or septic complications, which would require further evaluation and management.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's electrolyte imbalance may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures, if not managed properly.
7. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's coagulopathy may lead to further complications, such as bleeding or thrombosis, if not managed properly.
8. **Seizure Disorder:** The patient's seizure disorder may lead to further complications, such as status epilepticus, if not managed properly.
9. **Meningioma:** The patient's meningioma may lead to further complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, if not managed properly.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, electrolyte levels, and coagulation status closely.
2. Maintain the patient's respiratory support and wean oxygen therapy as tolerated.
3. Continue antibiotics according to the plan and monitor for signs of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and neurological function closely and consider further evaluation if necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's biliary obstruction and UTI.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's coagulopathy and seizure disorder.
8. Monitor the patient's meningioma and consider further evaluation and management if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role.

   Recommendations: The findings of the ERCP are consistent with biliary
   obstruction, but not cholangitis. Her obstruction may be due to
   papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. This could first be
   evaluated with MRCP as an outpatient.
   She will need a repeat ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   34 here.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - narrow abx as culture data and clinical status allows
   - ercp following and planning on ERCP in the AM
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   - BCx, UCx, Sputum Cx
   - f/u OSH speciation and sensitivities
   .
   #. respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Latest gas 7.44/27/95/19. Will
   likely be able to extubate after ERCP.
   - cont PSV at 15/5 for tonight
   - wean O2 as tolerated

   Successful intubation of the esophagus with a duodenoscope over a
   guidewire and with direct visual laryngoscopy. duodenoscope.
   The major papilla appeared prominent and was bludging.
   A single non-bleeding periampullary diverticulum with small opening was
   found at the major papilla.
   Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a sphincterotome
   after a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in
   complete opacification.
   A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD
   measuring 13-14 mm. There were no filling defects or strictures seen.
   A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
   sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Dark, clear bile drainined
   from the common bile duct after the sphincterotomy was performed. There
   was no sludge or pus seen.
   A 7cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent was placed successfully with
   excellent drainage of dark, clear bile after it was placed.
   Recommendations: The findings of the ERCP are consistent with biliary
   obstruction, but not cholangitis. Her obstruction may be due to
   papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. This could first be
   evaluated with MRCP as an outpatient.
   She will need a repeat ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   34 here.

   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Latest gas 7.44/27/95/19. Will
   likely be able to extubate after ERCP.
   - cont PSV at 15/5 for tonight
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - hold sedation and wean ventilation as tolerated following ERCP

   #. seizure disorder: There are notes indicated increased seizure
   acitivity in the weeks preceeding this event.  Her imaging is felt

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to the hospital with sepsis. The patient has undergone ERCP and has been diagnosed with a biliary obstruction, but not cholangitis. She has also been growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in her blood and urine, which are likely from a urosepsis or cholangitis source.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, other
* Altered mental status, not delirium
* Impaired skin integrity

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 34.6
* Hct: 34.3
* Platelet count: 201
* Creatinine: 0.6
* Troponin: <0.01
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 165 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 1.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show a small Zenker's diverticulum and a moderate diffuse dilation of the main duct with a CBD measuring 13-14 mm.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl) to cover most GI/uro sources
* Narrowing antibiotics as culture data and clinical status allow
* ERCP following and planning on ERCP in the AM
* IVF and monitoring hemodynamics
* BCx, UCx, and Sputum Cx
* Following OSH speciation and sensitivities

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening sepsis with organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure progressing to ARDS
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder worsening to acidosis or hyperkalemia
* Altered mental status progressing to delirium or coma
* Impaired skin integrity worsening to pressure ulcers or skin breakdown
* Recurrence of seizures or worsening of seizure disorder
* Development of DVT or pulmonary embolism
* Worsening liver function with elevated INR or bilirubin
* Development of pancreatitis or other complications related to ERCP."

   Recommendations: The findings of the ERCP are consistent with biliary
   obstruction, but not cholangitis. Her obstruction may be due to
   papillary stenosis or a periampullary lesion. This could first be

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  She is
   growing GNRs in her blood from the OSH and GNR lactose fermenters in
   her urine (ecoli, klebsiella, enterobacter). She could have urosepsis
   or cholangitis with seeding of urine. On levo, ceftaz, flagyl which
   will cover most GI/uro sources.  Bili is not overwhelmingly elevated,
   calling cholangitis as the source into question, and her elevated LFTs
   could be from shock with initial hypotension.  However, her elevated
   pancreatic enzymes, while could be [**1-17**] shock, seem to more strongly
   indicate a biliary obstructive picture.  Given mental status and
   instrumentation, CNS source is possible, though GNRs in blood and urine
   make it a less likely source.  LP may be risky in patient with large
   meningiona with midline shift.  Must also keep in mind the possibility
   of her seeding her intracranial hardware when bacteremic.  WBC down to
   19.5.  Etiology appears most likely to be urine.

   #. respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Latest gas 7.44/27/95/19. Will
   likely be able to extubate after ERCP.

   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  However, an event while hypotensive is possible.
   Heparinizing her would be risky at this time given upcoming ERCP,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy

   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small and patient is doing well on [**4-19**].

   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old female who presented to the hospital with sepsis, suspected to be caused by cholangitis or urosepsis. She has a history of meningioma and seizure disorder. Laboratory results show the presence of Klebsiella and E. coli in her blood, with the E. coli being pan-sensitive and the Klebsiella being resistant to ampicillin. She was initially treated with Cipro, which was switched to Keptra and then back to her home regimen of Tegretol.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with minimal support on positive pressure ventilation (PSV) and oxygenating well. However, she has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray with small bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient's mental status has improved significantly, and she is now awake and alert, following commands. However, she has a history of altered mental status, which may be related to Keppra, seizures, or recent sepsis and hospitalization.

The patient's laboratory results show decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts, which may be dilutional or medication-related. Her troponin levels are normal, and her INR is improving. She has evidence of liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing Cipro for pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin.
2. Planning for follow-up ERCP in 3-21 weeks for stent removal and possible sphincterotomy.
3. Monitoring hemodynamics and IV fluids.
4. Considering gentle diuresis with a goal of 500-1000cc negative today.
5. Attempting extubation today.
6. Switching back to prior longstanding home regimen of Tegretol for seizure control.
7. Trending hemoglobin and platelet counts, and transfusing as necessary.
8. Following INR and adjusting as necessary.
9. Providing pain management, bowel regimen, and pantoprazole as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia.
2. Respiratory failure due to continued respiratory support and potential for pneumonia.
3. Altered mental status due to ongoing sepsis, medication, or other underlying conditions.
4. Bleeding due to decreased platelet counts and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Liver dysfunction due to ongoing antibiotic use and potential for further liver damage.
6. Electrolyte imbalance due to ongoing fluid management and potential for further electrolyte disturbances.
7. Infection due to ongoing IV lines and potential for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
8. Wound complications due to ongoing surgical procedures and potential for further wound infection."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   On this day I examined Dr [**Known lastname 12663**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have also spoken with her daughter.  I have
   read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 803**]
s note above and agree with her findings and plan of
   care.
   The patient has had a dramatic improvement in mentation and today is
   awake and following commands. We think this is likely due to stopping
   Keppra which had been newly started at MtAuburn.  She is back on her
   prior Tegretol.
   Her vent status was excellent on PSV 5/5 and low RSBI despite here
   effusions on CXR and exam. We thus elected to extubate her and so far
   she is doing well.  We will try to gradually diurese away her pleural
   effusions with IV lasix, aiming for .5 to 1 liter neg daily.
   40 min spent in the care of this critically ill pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   On this day I examined Dr [**Known lastname 12663**] and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have also spoken with her daughter.  I have
   read Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 803**]
s note above and agree with her findings and plan of
   care.
   The patient has had a dramatic improvement in mentation and today is
   awake and following commands. We think this is likely due to stopping
   Keppra which had been newly started at MtAuburn.  She is back on her
   prior Tegretol.
   Her vent status was excellent on PSV 5/5 and low RSBI despite here
   effusions on CXR and exam. We thus elected to extubate her and so far
   she is doing well.  We will try to gradually diurese away her pleural
   effusions with IV lasix, aiming for .5 to 1 liter neg daily.
   40 min spent in the care of this critically ill pt

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder, admitted to the ICU with sepsis, cholangitis, and urosepsis. She has a resistant Klebsiella bacteremia and pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia. The patient is currently on Ciprofloxacin and has had a good response. She is also on Tegretol for seizure control and has had a recent craniotomy. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with minimal support on PSV. Her mental status has improved significantly after stopping Keppra and starting Tegretol. The patient has pleural effusions on CXR and is being diuresed to remove fluid.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a resistant Klebsiella bacteremia and pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration if the pleural effusions are not managed effectively.
3. Sepsis: The patient has had a recent episode of sepsis, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
4. Liver Enzyme Abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
5. Anemia: The patient has a decreased HCT level, which may be due to dilutional anemia or a underlying medical condition.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a decreased PLT level, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of meningioma, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, which may increase the risk of neurological complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
3. Continue to diurese the patient to remove pleural effusions and monitor for signs of respiratory compromise.
4. Monitor the patient's liver enzyme levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider transfusing the patient for anemia and thrombocytopenia.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a neurologist to further manage the patient's seizure disorder."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental
   status. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural effusions.
   - consider gentle diuresis given BPs
   - hold sedation and wean ventilation as tolerated
   - attempt extubation today
   .
   # altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.
   - trend [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand ischemia.
    Trended down to normal.

   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.
   - follow, improving

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder, admitted to the ICU with sepsis, suspected to be caused by cholangitis or urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella bacteremia resistant to ampicillin.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with minimal support. She is oxygenating well, but has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray with pleural effusions. The plan is to consider gentle diuresis, hold sedation, and wean ventilation as tolerated, with the goal of attempting extubation today.

The patient's mental status has been altered, and the cause is unclear. She was previously taking Keppra, but it was switched back to her prior home regimen of Tegretol. The patient's laboratory results show decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts, which may be due to dilutional effects or medication-related causes.

The patient has a history of meningioma, and her baseline radiology is stable. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has multiple lines inserted. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued sepsis and bacteremia, leading to further organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure, particularly if the patient is not weaned off mechanical ventilation or develops further respiratory complications.
3. Altered mental status, which could be caused by various factors, including medication, infection, or underlying neurological conditions.
4. Decreased hemoglobin and platelet counts, which could lead to bleeding complications or other hematological issues.
5. Volume overload and pleural effusions, which could worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of pulmonary complications.
6. Meningioma-related complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or seizures.
7. Antibiotic-related complications, such as allergic reactions or Clostridioides difficile infection.
8. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient is unable to tolerate oral nutrition or has inadequate enteral feeding.
9. Wound complications, particularly if the patient has open wounds or surgical sites.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**2-22**]
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small.  Pt successfully extubated yesterday,
   nearly re-intubated overnight given copious secretions.
   - TBB goal (-) one to two liters, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient
   continues to be somnolent with limited verbal communication.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol,
   d/w pharm re: Keppra IV dosing equivalent to home tegretol
   - cont to have difficulty taking POs, will consider placement of NG
   tube today, as pt failed S/S today
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.  Now stabilized.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**2-22**]
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small.  Pt successfully extubated yesterday,
   nearly re-intubated overnight given copious secretions.
   - TBB goal (-) one to two liters, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient
   continues to be somnolent with limited verbal communication.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol,
   d/w pharm re: Keppra IV dosing equivalent to home tegretol
   - cont to have difficulty taking POs, will consider placement of NG
   tube today, as pt failed S/S today
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.  Now stabilized.
   - trend daily
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  Trended down to normal.
   ..
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.  Resolved.
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as she was intubated for respiratory protection and had mild respiratory distress overnight. She was successfully extubated, but nearly re-intubated due to copious secretions.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has a history of electrolyte and fluid disorders, including hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Her current electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but her fluid balance is a concern, with a negative balance of 1,712 mL over the past 24 hours.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved, but she remains somnolent with limited verbal communication. Her altered mental status may be related to sepsis, sedation, or medication side effects.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and her current condition is complicated by cholangitis and urosepsis. She is at risk for ongoing sepsis and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Decreased Hematocrit and Platelet Count: The patient's hematocrit and platelet count are low, which may be related to dilutional effects or medication side effects. Her platelet count is stabilized, but her hematocrit is trending downward.
6. Cerebral Edema: The patient's meningioma is a concern for cerebral edema, which may be exacerbated by her altered mental status and decreased hematocrit.
7. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be related to sepsis, medication side effects, or underlying liver disease. Her INR is within normal limits, but her liver function may be compromised.
8. Wound Complications: The patient's surgical site is at risk for wound complications, including infection and dehiscence.
9. Thromboembolic Complications: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic complications, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, given her prolonged immobility and underlying medical conditions.
10. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, as she is unable to take oral medications and has a negative fluid balance. She may be at risk for malnutrition and dehydration.

In summary, the patient's progress note highlights several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient was intubated at 22:30 and extubated at 12:08 PM. The patient's mental status has improved, but they are not at baseline, being alert and responsive but not verbal. The patient responded well to 10 IV Lasix and is unable to take PO's, having missed one dose of tegretol.

The patient has mild respiratory distress overnight, with increased tachycardia (110s) and hypertension (160s), but ABG and CXR looked good. The patient was producing thick sputum and was unable to cough it up, requiring nasotracheal suction.

The patient has a history of craniotomy and is unable to stand due to muscle wasting. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema and is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and vasopressors.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 31.4-34.6
* Hct: 28.0-34.3
* Plt: 126-156
* Cr: 0.3-0.6
* TropT: <0.01
* TCO2: 19-27
* Glucose: 81-119
* Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, other
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Impaired skin integrity

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Pneumonia or respiratory tract infection due to thick sputum production
* Sepsis or septic shock due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria or inadequate antibiotic coverage
* Electrolyte imbalances or fluid overload due to IV fluids and medications
* Worsening of altered mental status or development of delirium
* Impaired wound healing due to impaired skin integrity
* Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**2-22**]
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small.  Pt successfully extubated yesterday,
   nearly re-intubated overnight given copious secretions.
   - TBB goal (-) one liter, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient
   continues to be somnolent with limited verbal communication.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol
   - cont to have difficulty taking POs, will consider placement of NG
   tube today
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.  Now stabilized.
   - trend daily
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  Trended down to normal.
   ..
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.  Resolved.
   .
   #. Meningioma: baseline per [**Hospital3 140**] radiology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 12663**] is a 87 yo female with PMH of meningioma and seizure
   disorder who presented to [**Hospital6 5579**] on [**2157-12-29**] with sepsis.
   .
   #. Sepsis: cholangitis vs urosepsis are most likely sources.  OSH
   cultures show 2 different organisms in blood, Klebsiella and E. coli,
   suggesting both urinary and biliary sources leading to bacteremia. All
   cx sensitive to cipro.
   - cont cipro given pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and Klebsiella
   bacteremia resistant only to ampicillin, today day [**2-22**]
   - plan for f/u ERCP in [**3-21**] weeks for stent removal and possible
   sphincterotomy
   - IVF and monitor hemodynamics
   .
   #. Respiratory failure: was reportedly intubated for respiratory
   protection in the setting of mental status changes.  She is oxygenating
   well on PSV with minimal support.  Remained intubated [**1-17**] mental status
   which is now improved. Also has e/o volume overload on CXR with pleural
   effusions, but they are small.  Pt successfully extubated yesterday,
   nearly re-intubated overnight given copious secretions.
   - TBB goal (-) one liter, via lasix 10 mg IV PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: ? keppra vs. seizure vs. recent
   sepsis/hospitalization.  Head CT stable, EEG neg. [**Name (NI) 12705**], pt improved
   significantly with D/C Keppra. Sepsis may have also contributed, as
   well as sedation in setting of elevated liver enzymes.  Patient
   continues to be somnolent with limited verbal communication.
   - switched keppra back to prior longstanding home regimen of tegretol
   - cont to have difficulty taking POs, will consider placement of NG
   tube today
   .
   #. Decreased HCT and PLT: may be dilutional since all lines decreased.
   Otherwise may be med-related given multiple abx tried over past few
   weeks.  Now stabilized.
   - trend daily
   - transfuse for Hct<21
   .
   #. CEs: Given low peak troponin and setting, likely is demand
   ischemia.  Trended down to normal.
   ..
   #. Elevated INR: nutrition/vit K deficiency vs. underlying liver
   abnormality vs antibiotic effect.  Resolved.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder who presented to the hospital with sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient is oxygenating well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with minimal support.

The patient's physical examination reveals a general appearance of no acute distress, with a soft and non-tender abdomen, and bilateral peripheral pulses present. The patient's neurologic examination shows an attentive and responsive patient who follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 31.4 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 174 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 139 mmol/L, potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L, and chloride level of 108 mmol/L.

The patient's microbiology results show that the blood cultures are negative, and the patient has been treated with ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient's plan includes continued treatment with ciprofloxacin, IV fluids, and monitoring of hemodynamics. The patient is also scheduled for a follow-up ERCP in three weeks for stent removal and possible sphincterotomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate, leading to the need for reintubation or mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid levels can become imbalanced, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status can continue to decline, leading to decreased level of consciousness, confusion, or disorientation.
5. Decreased hemoglobin and platelet count: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of bleeding.
6. Liver enzyme elevation: The patient's liver enzymes can continue to be elevated, leading to liver damage or failure.
7. Meningioma: The patient's meningioma can recur or worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or other complications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder due to meningioma, currently experiencing respiratory distress, sepsis, and pleural effusions. 

The patient was extubated yesterday and remains with copious respiratory secretions, requiring frequent suctioning. He experienced respiratory distress last night, which improved with vigorous suctioning. The patient's mental status remains abnormal, with limited responses, and is better understood in Polish than English.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin), antifungal medication (Tegretol), and anticoagulation therapy (Heparin Sodium). He is also receiving fluid therapy, including furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 141/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral pleural effusions, with no signs of acute distress, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 31.4-34.6 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.3-34.3%
* Platelet count: 174-201 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 145 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory distress attributed to sepsis and possibly seizure activity
* Sepsis attributed to urinary source, responding to current management
* Pleural effusions attributed to resuscitation fluids, with a plan to allow net diuresis
* Seizures attributed to meningioma, with no active seizures, and treatment with Tegretol
* Fluid therapy to allow net diuresis to baseline weight
* Altered mental status attributed to medications, possibly sedating component of Kepra
* Nutritional support via enteroflex tube placement to initiate total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
* Daughter desires for do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address his various medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He was extubated yesterday and remains with copious respiratory secretions, requiring frequent suctioning. His mental status remains abnormal, with limited responses and unclear baseline. He has a history of seizure disorder due to a meningioma. He was treated with antibiotics and other medications, including furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/69 mmHg. He has bilateral pleural effusions and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Assessment:

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to sepsis and possibly seizure activity. His sepsis is attributed to a urinary source and has responded to current management. He has underlying bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely due to resuscitation fluids. His altered mental status is attributed to medications, possibly including sedating components of Kepra. He has a history of seizure disorder due to a meningioma and is being treated with tegretol.

Plan:

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring for evidence of VAP
* Maintaining an upright position and out of bed if tolerated
* Allowing net diuresis to resolve bilateral pleural effusions
* Continuing antibiotics and other medications as prescribed
* Initiating total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through an enteroflex tube
* Considering nutritional support, including TPN and tube feeds
* Maintaining glycemic control
* Continuing stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment as necessary

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and underlying respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk for recurrence, particularly if his underlying urinary source is not fully treated.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory compromise and other complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if his underlying medical conditions are not managed properly, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
5. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is at risk for seizure activity, particularly if his underlying meningioma is not fully treated.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his underlying medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve his overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yof seizure disorder (meningioma), now with resolving sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved.  Attributed to sepsis and perhaps
   seizure (altered mental status).  Now with copious secretions.
   Underlying bilateral pleural effusions.  Monitor for evidence for VAP
   (extubated yesterday).  Maintain upright position, OOB if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- attributed to urinary source.  Responded to current
   management.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- attributed to resussitation fluids.  Plan to allow
   net diuresis.
   SEIZURES -- h/o meningioma.  No active seizures.  Rx with tegretal
   prior to admission.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Plan to allow net diresis, to baseline
   weight.
   Altered mental status -- improved.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to medications,
   perhaps sedating component of Kepra.  Also consider

   reintubated in the event of respiratory decompensation.  She
   understands that patient may expire if intubation not pursued in the
   context of respiratory failure.  Patient
s daughter states this is
   consistent with patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ADDENDUM:
   Patient
s daughter (HCP) states that she does not want patient to be
   reintubated in the event of respiratory decompensation.  She
   understands that patient may expire if intubation not pursued in the
   context of respiratory failure.  Patient
s daughter states this is
   consistent with patient
s previously expressed wishes.   Also, no CPR.
   Will respect these wishes.  In the event of respiratory decompensation,
   will then focus on patient comfort as primary goal.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder (meningioma) who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. He was previously intubated but was extubated yesterday. He remains with copious respiratory secretions, requiring frequent suctioning. His mental status is abnormal, with limited responses, and he is unable to speak English as well as Polish.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/69 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 97% on aerosol-cool, face tent, and ABG results are 7.43/40/59/28/1. His physical examination is normal, with no acute distress or signs of respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal liver function tests. His troponin-T level is <0.01, and his lactic acid level is 0.9 mmol/L.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to sepsis and perhaps seizure (altered mental status). He is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his bilateral pleural effusions. He will be monitored for evidence of VAP and maintained in an upright position to improve lung expansion.

The patient's sepsis is attributed to a urinary source and has responded to current management. His pleural effusions are attributed to resuscitation fluids and will be allowed to resolve with net diuresis.

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to medications, particularly the sedating component of Kepra. He will be monitored for any changes in his mental status.

The patient's nutritional support will be initiated with enteroflex tube placement, and his daughter desires to be updated on his medical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his bilateral pleural effusions and previous intubation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, especially if he is not reintubated.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Pleural effusions: The patient's pleural effusions may worsen, leading to respiratory compromise.
5. Medication-related complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to medications, which may worsen or lead to other complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional support may be inadequate, leading to malnutrition and other complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient closely for signs of VAP and respiratory failure.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Monitor the patient's pleural effusions and allow them to resolve with net diuresis.
4. Adjust the patient's medications to minimize sedation and promote mental status improvement.
5. Initiate nutritional support with enteroflex tube placement and monitor the patient's nutritional status.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Respect the patient's wishes and focus on patient comfort as the primary goal in the event of respiratory decompensation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yof seizure disorder (meningioma), now with resolving sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved.  Attributed to sepsis and perhaps
   seizure (altered mental status).  Now with copious secretions.
   Underlying bilateral pleural effusions.  Monitor for evidence for VAP
   (extubated yesterday).  Maintain upright position, OOB if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- attributed to urinary source.  Responded to current
   management.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- attributed to resussitation fluids.  Plan to allow
   net diuresis.
   SEIZURES -- h/o meningioma.  No active seizures.  Rx with tegretal
   prior to admission.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Plan to allow net diresis, to baseline
   weight.
   Altered mental status -- improved.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to medications,
   perhaps sedating component of Kepra.  Also consider
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Plan  enteroflex tube placemnt to initiate
   TF.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has a history of seizure disorder due to a meningioma. The patient was extubated yesterday and remains with copious respiratory secretions, requiring frequent suctioning.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 99 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 141/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Normal

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Respiratory system: Bilateral pleural effusions, copious respiratory secretions
* Cardiovascular system: Normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs or rubs
* Neurological system: Altered mental status, no active seizures
* Abdominal system: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left lower extremity edema (1+)

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 31.4-34.6 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 33.3-34.3%
* Platelet count: 174-201 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.6 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01 ng/mL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 81-119 mg/dL
* Other labs: Normal or slightly elevated

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Respiratory distress: Improved, attributed to sepsis and perhaps seizure. Monitor for evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Sepsis: Responded to current management, attributed to urinary source.
* Pleural effusions: Plan to allow net diuresis.
* Seizures: No active seizures, patient has a history of meningioma. Rx with tegretol prior to admission.
* Fluids: Plan to allow net diuresis to baseline weight.
* Altered mental status: Improved, attributed to medications, perhaps sedating component of Kepra.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Sepsis
* Pleural effusions
* Seizures
* Fluid overload
* Altered mental status
* Respiratory failure

Given the patient's critical illness and the potential for complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat any adverse events."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder, who presented to the hospital with sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tcurrent 36.1°C, HR 90 bpm, BP 139/68 mmHg, RR 19 inspirations per minute, SpO2 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,301 mL of IV fluids and has a total output of 3,250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,949 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving mechanical ventilation, but is receiving oxygen therapy at 2 L/min.
* Neurological status: The patient is awake and alert, but has altered mental status and is unable to communicate verbally. She is also unable to stand or ambulate.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 34.6, Hct is 34.3, and platelet count is 51,000. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels. Her creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 119 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her ongoing infection and immunosuppressed state.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygenation or ventilation is not adequately managed.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for renal failure if her fluid and electrolyte balance is not managed appropriately.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she is at risk for hepatic failure if her liver function continues to deteriorate.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and she is at risk for cardiovascular instability if her vasopressor support is not adequately managed.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal tract is at risk for bleeding due to her altered mental status and inability to swallow.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications due to her ongoing infection, respiratory compromise, and altered mental status. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure her optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of meningioma and seizure disorder who was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely caused by cholangitis and urosepsis. She has been treated with antibiotics and is currently receiving IV fluids and medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/68 mmHg. Her respiratory status is compromised, with a SpO2 of 94% and an ABG of 7.25/25. She is currently extubated but has marginal airway protection due to thick secretions.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13. She is able to follow simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli, but has limited verbal communication. Her neuroimaging studies, including a head CT and EEG, are stable.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, including a white blood cell count of 34.6 and a C-reactive protein level of 19.5. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and her creatinine level is 0.4. Her potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, and her magnesium level is 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she may require further respiratory support.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's neurological status is altered, and she may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Sepsis: The patient has evidence of sepsis, and her treatment plan should include continued antibiotics and IV fluids.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are trending down, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for liver dysfunction.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is 0.4, and she may require further evaluation and treatment for renal dysfunction.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, and her magnesium level is 1.9 mg/dL. She may require further evaluation and treatment for electrolyte imbalance.
7. Meningioma: The patient has a history of meningioma, and her treatment plan should include ongoing evaluation and treatment for this condition.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. She requires ongoing evaluation and treatment for sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, and meningioma."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder (meningioma) who is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress, sepsis, and pleural effusions. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 129/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His respiratory status has improved, with copious secretions and bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient has a history of meningioma and has been seizure-free since admission. However, he has been prescribed tegretal for seizure prophylaxis. His mental status has improved, and he is now able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, with hypokalemia, but are expected to be repleted to >4.0. His liver enzymes and kidney function tests are normal. 

The patient's medications include Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, Furosemide, Pantoprazole, and Heparin Sodium. He is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker. 

The patient's plan includes continued respiratory support, maintenance of an upright position, and close monitoring for evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He will also be evaluated for nutritional support, including a speech/swallow evaluation to determine if he requires a feeding tube. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor for further care."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yof seizure disorder (meningioma), now with resolving sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved.  Attributed to sepsis and perhaps
   seizure (altered mental status).  Now with copious secretions.
   Underlying bilateral pleural effusions.  Monitor for evidence for VAP
   (extubated yesterday).  Maintain upright position, OOB if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved, responded to current
   management.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- attributed to resussitation fluids.  Plan to allow
   net diuresis.
   SEIZURES -- h/o meningioma.  No active seizures.  Rx with tegretal
   prior to admission.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Plan to allow net diresis, to baseline
   weight.
   Altered mental status -- improved.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to medications,
   perhaps sedating component of Kepra.  Also consider
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Plan speech/swallow evaluation -->
   consider TF (enteroflex tube) if fails evaluation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yof seizure disorder (meningioma), now with resolving sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- improved.  Attributed to sepsis and perhaps
   seizure (altered mental status).  Now with copious secretions.
   Underlying bilateral pleural effusions.  Monitor for evidence for VAP
   (extubated yesterday).  Maintain upright position, OOB if tolerates.
   SEPSIS -- attributed to urinary source.  Resolved, responded to current
   management.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- attributed to resussitation fluids.  Plan to allow
   net diuresis.
   SEIZURES -- h/o meningioma.  No active seizures.  Rx with tegretal
   prior to admission.
   FLUIDS -- s/p resussitation.  Plan to allow net diresis, to baseline
   weight.
   Altered mental status -- improved.  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to medications,
   perhaps sedating component of Kepra.  Also consider
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Plan speech/swallow evaluation -->
   consider TF (enteroflex tube) if fails evaluation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder (meningioma) who is currently in the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient's condition has improved, with copious secretions and altered mental status attributed to sepsis and possibly seizure activity. The patient has underlying bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely related to resuscitation fluids.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 129/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device in use.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, but the patient is frail and appears more comfortable today. The patient's neurological examination is notable for hoarse vocalization, but the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 34.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 156 K/uL. The patient's blood chemistry profile is notable for elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels, as well as hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's plan of care includes maintenance of upright position, oxygen therapy as needed, and close monitoring for evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is also planned for speech and swallow evaluation, with consideration of enteral nutrition if the evaluation fails.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying bilateral pleural effusions and respiratory distress make them at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis and septic shock makes them at risk for recurrent sepsis.
3. VAP: The patient's respiratory support and underlying bilateral pleural effusions make them at risk for VAP.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential need for enteral nutrition make them at risk for nutritional deficiencies.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of seizure disorder and potential need for enteral nutrition make them at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Infections: The patient's history of sepsis and underlying bilateral pleural effusions make them at risk for infections.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of seizure disorder and potential need for enteral nutrition make them at risk for cardiovascular complications such as hypertension and tachycardia.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizure disorder and potential need for sedating medications make them at risk for neurological complications such as altered mental status and seizures."
