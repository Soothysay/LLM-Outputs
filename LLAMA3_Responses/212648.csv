You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 76-year-old woman, is a post-cardiac arrest patient with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She had a VT arrest and was resuscitated. She is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has hypotension, and her heart rhythm is currently sinus, with a history of afib and tachy-brady syndrome.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Ischemic VF arrest, which may recur if not properly managed.
	* Potential for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure.
	* Need for ICD implantation if the patient recovers.
2. **Hypotension:**
	* Multifactorial causes, including intubation, propofol, intravascular depletion, possible ACS, and heart failure.
	* Potential for further hypotension, which may worsen cardiac function.
3. **Leukocytosis:**
	* Potential UTI, which may worsen the patient's condition.
	* Need for close monitoring of CBC and CXR to rule out complications.
4. **Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease:**
	* Potential for worsening kidney function, which may require further interventions.
5. **Anemia:**
	* Potential for worsening anemia, which may require transfusion.
6. **GI Bleeding:**
	* Potential for further GI bleeding, which may worsen the patient's condition.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue Arctic sun cooling for 24 hours.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and vital signs closely.
3. Continue intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Place an arterial line today.
5. Perform a TTE today.
6. Consider ICD implantation if the patient recovers.
7. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider dopamine infusion if necessary.
8. Start levoquinolone for UTI and continue to monitor CBC and CXR.
9. Trend CBC daily to monitor anemia and consider transfusion if necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's kidney function and consider further interventions if necessary.

**ICU Care:**

1. Nutrition: NPO.
2. Glycemic control: insulin.
3. Lines: Multi-lumen central line.
4. Prophylaxis: DVT - sc heparin, Stress ulcer - IV famotidine, VAP - VAP bundle."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight and height remain unchanged from admission.

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including an arterial line placement, trans-thoracic echo, nasal swab, EKG, urine culture, and EEG. The results of these tests are not provided in the note, but the patient's troponin-T levels are elevated at 0.11 ng/mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, dopamine, fentanyl, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's blood products include total in of 2,617 mL, total out of 867 mL, and urine output of 867 mL.

The patient's laboratory results include a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, a troponin-T level of 0.11 ng/mL, and a lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's plan includes continued ICU care, nutrition via IV fluids, and glycemic control. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's first-degree AV block and prior VF arrest.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's elevated lactate level and potential infections.
4. Renal failure due to the patient's elevated creatinine level.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's risk for stress ulcer.
6. Pulmonary embolism or DVT due to the patient's immobility and risk factors.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's need for mechanical ventilation.
8. Infection or sepsis due to the patient's IV lines and catheters.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and heart failure, suffered a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20% on echocardiogram, indicating significant cardiac dysfunction. The inferior wall akinesis noted on echocardiogram is likely representing stunned myocardium.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has been sedated with midazolam and fentanyl. She is also receiving dopamine to maintain blood pressure and has been started on a gentle intravenous fluid (IVF) regimen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated troponin T levels, suggesting ongoing cardiac damage
* Leukocytosis, which may be secondary to cardiac arrest or sepsis
* Acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL on admission, which has improved to 2.5 mg/dL
* Anemia, with a normocytic normochromic anemia and iron deficiency
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating kidney dysfunction

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to ongoing cardiac damage and dysfunction
* Sepsis, secondary to potential infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections
* Acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease
* Anemia, which may worsen if not addressed
* Hypertension, which may be difficult to control due to ongoing cardiac dysfunction and medication use
* Mitral regurgitation, which may worsen if not managed properly

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Completion of the Arctic Sun protocol to rewarm the patient
* Weaning of sedation as tolerated
* CT head without contrast to evaluate for potential neurologic damage
* Electrophysiology (EP) evaluation to assess for potential implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement
* Resumption of beta-blockers once blood pressure allows and pressors are weaned
* Monitoring for potential infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections
* Management of anemia, including consideration of transfusion if necessary
* Ongoing monitoring of cardiac function and kidney status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **], [**Doctor Last Name 9539**].

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

* The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and s/p CABG x 4. She had a VF arrest and was resuscitated.
* The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation.
* Her cardiac function is compromised, with an EF of 15-20% and akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere.
* She has a history of heart failure and is likely experiencing stunned myocardium.
* The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block, but she is not meeting criteria for ACS.
* She has a troponin T level of 0.08-0.11, which is likely secondary to the cardiac arrest.
* The patient has hypotension, which is being treated with gentle IV fluids and dopamine.
* She has leukocytosis, which is stable at 17.3, and a grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, and diarrhea.
* The patient has acute on chronic kidney disease, with a baseline Cr of 1.4-1.5 and an admission Cr of 3.3. Her urine lytes suggest a pre-renal etiology.
* She has anemia, which is normocytic normochromic with high RDW, and ferritin, TIBC, and TRF levels suggestive of iron deficiency.
* The patient has hypertension, which is being treated with pressors, and mitral regurgitation, which is stable per TTE.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: Further cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Renal complications: Acute kidney injury, worsening of chronic kidney disease, or electrolyte imbalances.
* Infectious complications: Sepsis, urinary tract infections, or respiratory infections.
* Hematological complications: Bleeding, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.
* Nutritional complications: Malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.
* Cardiovascular complications: Hypotension, hypertension, or cardiac failure.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend close monitoring of her cardiac function, respiratory status, and renal function. Additionally, it is essential to manage her hypotension, leukocytosis, and anemia, and to continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - ICD this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and s/p CABG x 4, who suffered a VF/VT arrest. She was intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her initial TTE demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, likely representing stunned myocardium. She is receiving an Artic Sun protocol, and her sedation is being weaned as tolerated. She has been diagnosed with acute on chronic kidney disease, anemia, and leukocytosis, and is being treated for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute on chronic kidney disease may progress, leading to further kidney damage or failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure or pneumonia.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and she may be at risk for further neurological damage or deterioration.
5. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly pneumonia or sepsis, given her compromised immune system and recent cardiac arrest.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications, such as cardiovascular instability or respiratory failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea may persist or worsen, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
9. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may persist or worsen, leading to further complications, such as infection or bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF, who suffered a VT arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for hypotension, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with an EF of 15-20% on TTE, indicating significant cardiac dysfunction. The patient's troponin T levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial damage. The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block, but the patient is being held on beta-blockers due to hypotension.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and a urine output of 867 mL over 24 hours. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: At 3.4; related to low cardiac output and pressors.
   Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   -          follow
   -          improve fluid status and reseasess plan
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation
   .
   # Gout
 patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: At 3.4; related to low cardiac output and pressors.
   Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   -          follow
   -          improve fluid status and reseasess plan
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation
   .
   # Gout
 patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She had a VT arrest and was resuscitated. She is currently in the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and c-diff infection. She has a low cardiac output, requiring pressor support, and is mechanically ventilated. Her blood pressure is labile, and she has a high risk of aspiration pneumonia. She is also anemic and has a low platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's c-diff infection and sepsis are likely to worsen her condition, leading to multi-organ failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential need for dialysis.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's risk of aspiration pneumonia is high due to her mechanical ventilation and sedation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's low cardiac output and requirement for pressor support increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen, leading to further complications, such as fatigue and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count increases her risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures.
7. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's acute renal failure and c-diff infection are likely to lead to electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia.
8. Infection: The patient's c-diff infection is likely to spread to other parts of her body, leading to further complications, such as septic shock and multi-organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive treatment for sepsis, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac output and adjust pressor support as needed.
3. Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion of packed red blood cells if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and consider transfusion of platelets if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalances and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider placement of a central venous catheter for further monitoring and treatment.
8. Consider consultation with a nephrologist and infectious disease specialist to optimize treatment for the patient's acute renal failure and c-diff infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF, who had a VT arrest. She was admitted with acute renal failure (ARF) and was found to have C. difficile (C. diff) infection. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/34 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 100%, and her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 71%. She has a central venous pressure of 15 mmHg and a cardiac index of 3.7 L/min/m2.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (34.3 K/uL), bands (22.0%), and creatinine (2.7 mg/dL). Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 30 mg/dL, and her serum potassium is 5.6 mEq/L. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 33 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 33 IU/L. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is 327 IU/L, and her calcium is 8.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She has a history of VT arrest and is currently on pressor support with norepinephrine (0.04 mcg/kg/min). She is also on antibiotics for C. diff infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a history of ARF. Further decline in renal function could lead to the need for dialysis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a C. diff infection, which can cause sepsis. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and recent NSTEMI. She is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is at risk for respiratory failure if her lungs do not improve.
5. Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and has a history of VT arrest. She is at risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a C. diff infection, which can cause gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea.
7. Hematological complications: The patient has anemia and is at risk for further hematological complications, such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF (EF 25-30%).
* She had a VF/VT arrest and required pressor support with dopamine, which was switched to norepinephrine.
* The patient has developed acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL and is receiving treatment with vancomycin and flagyl for a c-diff infection.
* She has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 34.3 and 22% bands, likely related to the c-diff infection.
* The patient has lactic acidosis with a level of 3.4 mmol/L, likely related to low cardiac output and pressors.
* She has hypotension, which is being managed with norepinephrine.
* The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB).
* She has anemia with a normocytic normochromic anemia and iron deficiency.
* The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with holding ACEI, spironolactone, and lasix.
* She has mitral regurgitation, which is stable per TTE.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the c-diff infection
* Renal failure and acidosis due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and pressor therapy
* Lactic acidosis and hypotension due to low cardiac output and pressors
* Anemia and iron deficiency, which can worsen with ongoing bleeding or blood loss
* Hypertension, which can worsen with ongoing pressor therapy
* Mitral regurgitation, which can worsen with changes in cardiac function or hemodynamics
* Gout flares, which can occur with changes in uric acid levels or medication therapy

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Fluid challenge with 2L given dry lungs
* Restart of dopamine at 2 for renal vasodilation, with assessment of utility over the day
* Discontinuation of levaquin and start of PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for ARF as a complication of c-diff
* Discontinuation of dopamine and start of norepinephrine to avoid renal vasoconstriction
* Daily urine lytes, UA, CX, and eos ordered if there is an increase in urine output
* Renal consult in the morning
* Holding spironolactone and lisinopril
* Start of PO vancomycin and IV flagyl for c-diff
* Serial q8 abdominal exams
* Start of tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
* Placement on precautions
* Weaning of pressors as tolerated
* Weaning of sedation as tolerated
* RISBI and breathing trials
* Discussion with neurology regarding repeat CT and EEG
* Assessment of neurologic status
* Resume of beta-blockers once BP allows and pressors are weaned
* Follow-up of lactic acidosis and anemia
* Holding of ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for hypertension
* Continue of home medications on extubation for asthma
* Holding of allopurinol in ARF for gout."

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD
   tonight or tomorrow morning
   - DP pulses not dopplerable, femoral pulses weak but palpable
   - ABG acidotic, continued on bicarb gtt
   - KUB ordered for more abdominal distention, consistent with early
   toxic megacolon
   - PO vanc increased from 125mg to 500mg Q6h, PR vanc started
   - OGT put on low wall suction
   - repeat KUB showed some improvement
   - surgery consulted, no surgery for now, pending neuro status
   - at about 11:40pm, pt was noted to have anisocoria, right pupil
   (4mm)minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm, concerning for
   herniation
   - vent setting changed to promote hyperventilation, HOB elevated at 30
   degree, mannitol considered but decided against it given renal failure,
   hypotension, acidosis
   - repeat head CT with EEG leads on showed that right sided brain is
   completely edematous, significantly different from one day prior
   - neurosurg contact[**Name (NI) **] but they wanted to have neuro see her first
   - in the morning around 5am, pupils were checked again, equal, 2.5mm
   mimimal-to-no reactivity to light
   - family said that patient would not want to live if neurological
   function is poor, ""not want to live as vegetable""
   - still full code, but husband will fly in tomorrow pm from [**State 1771**], a
   family meeting was proposed for 4pm tomorrow, it would be good to have
   neuro for the meeting

   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD
   tonight or tomorrow morning
   - DP pulses not dopplerable, femoral pulses weak but palpable
   - ABG acidotic, continued on bicarb gtt
   - KUB ordered for more abdominal distention, consistent with early
   toxic megacolon
   - PO vanc increased from 125mg to 500mg Q6h, PR vanc started
   - OGT put on low wall suction
   - repeat KUB showed some improvement
   - surgery consulted, no surgery for now, pending neuro status
   - at about 11:40pm, pt was noted to have anisocoria, right pupil

   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF, who suffered a VT arrest and was resuscitated. She was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis. She has been on pressors, vasopressors, and IV fluids, and has had multiple interventions to manage her conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and she has muddy brown casts in her urine, consistent with ATN. This may lead to further deterioration of her renal function.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high likelihood of developing sepsis due to her c-diff infection, and this may lead to further organ dysfunction.
3. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neuro status is poor, and her pupils are anisocoric, which is concerning for herniation. Further neurological deterioration is possible.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and she has a high risk of bleeding. This may lead to further complications.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, and she has a high risk of developing liver failure.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and she has a high risk of developing leukopenia or neutropenia.
7. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and she has a high risk of developing further lactic acidosis.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator, and she has a high risk of developing respiratory failure.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of CAD, and her cardiac function is compromised. She may experience further cardiovascular instability.
10. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, including pneumonia, UTI, and bloodstream infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
2. Aggressively manage her sepsis with antibiotics and IV fluids.
3. Continue to monitor her neurological status and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Monitor her coagulopathy and bleeding risk, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor her liver function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Monitor her leukocytosis and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor her lactate levels and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor her respiratory function and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
9. Continue to monitor her cardiovascular stability and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
10. Monitor her for signs of infection and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.

Family meeting:

A family meeting is planned for this afternoon to discuss the patient's prognosis and treatment options with her husband, who has arrived from [**State 1771**]. The neurologist should be present at the meeting to provide an update on the patient's neurological status and prognosis."

   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD
   tonight or tomorrow morning
   - DP pulses not dopplerable, femoral pulses weak but palpable
   - ABG acidotic, continued on bicarb gtt
   - KUB ordered for more abdominal distention, consistent with early
   toxic megacolon
   - PO vanc increased from 125mg to 500mg Q6h, PR vanc started
   - OGT put on low wall suction
   - repeat KUB showed some improvement
   - surgery consulted, no surgery for now, pending neuro status
   - at about 11:40pm, pt was noted to have anisocoria, right pupil
   (4mm)minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm, concerning for

   - in the morning around 5am, pupils were checked again, equal, 2.5mm
   mimimal-to-no reactivity to light
   - family said that patient would not want to live if neurological
   function is poor, ""not want to live as vegetable""
   - still full code, but husband will fly in tomorrow pm from [**State 1771**], a

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, and CHF, was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a VF/VT arrest. She was found to have anisocoria, which is concerning for herniation. Her neurological status is poor, with EEG showing global suppression. She has acute renal failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, leukocytosis with bandemia, lactic acidosis, and anemia. She has been treated with pressors, antibiotics, and fluids, but her condition remains unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's anisocoria and poor neurological status are concerning for herniation. If left untreated, this could lead to permanent brain damage or death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and metabolic acidosis are life-threatening complications of her c-diff infection. If left untreated, this could lead to multiple organ failure and death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure is a life-threatening complication of her septic shock. If left untreated, this could lead to chronic kidney disease or even death.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver dysfunction is a concern, as it could lead to further complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and bleeding.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is a concern, as it could lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is a concern, as it could lead to further complications such as organ failure and death.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a concern, as it could lead to further complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac history and current condition make her susceptible to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as she is on mechanical ventilation and has a high risk of developing respiratory failure.
10. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's c-diff infection and toxic megacolon make her susceptible to gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation, abscess, and sepsis.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to treat the patient's septic shock and metabolic acidosis with antibiotics, fluids, and pressors.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with dialysis and fluids.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's lactic acidosis and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust treatment accordingly.

Family Meeting:

A family meeting is planned for this afternoon to discuss the patient's condition and prognosis with her husband and daughter. The neurologist will be present to discuss the patient's neurological status and potential outcomes."

   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD

   CT head [**1-1**] (my read): right hemisphere significantly edematous, no
   midline shift. Significantly different from CT head from [**12-30**]
   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levophed on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today
   - trend lytes and renal function daily
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   failure, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be
   secondary to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - can consider give pt IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely as part of the multi-organ failure in septic shock.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**12-31**] to 26.4 secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct daily
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levophed on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today
   - trend lytes and renal function daily
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   failure, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be
   secondary to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - can consider give pt IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely as part of the multi-organ failure in septic shock.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double

# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.

   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I have summarized the key points and identified potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF, presented with VT arrest and was found to have a large brain infarct and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has developed multiple organ dysfunction, including acute renal failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, and lactic acidosis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Brain Injury:** The patient has a grave prognosis with irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and a large brain infarct. There is a high risk of further neurological deterioration and potential for herniation.
2. **Septic Shock:** The patient is at risk of further septic shock due to ongoing c-diff infection and multi-organ failure.
3. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for dialysis.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and there is a risk of bleeding.
5. **Lactic Acidosis:** The patient's lactic acidosis is improving, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to low cardiac output and pressors.
6. **Liver Dysfunction:** The patient's liver function is abnormal, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to sepsis and potential need for liver transplantation.
7. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's leukocytosis is secondary to c-diff infection and UTI, and there is a risk of further neutrophilia and potential for respiratory failure.
8. **Rhythm Disturbances:** The patient's rhythm is abnormal, and there is a risk of further arrhythmias and potential for cardiac arrest.

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's family has been informed of her grave prognosis, and withdrawal of care is likely to be discussed. The patient's care plan includes continued treatment of c-diff infection, management of septic shock, and optimization of her hemodynamic status. The patient's neuro status will be closely monitored, and further interventions will be considered as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double

   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.  Patient has no
   spontaneous respiration, no albuterol needed.

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman, is a complex case with multiple medical issues. She has suffered a large brain infarct, likely due to hypoxic-ischemic injury, and has irreversible brain damage. She is also experiencing acute renal failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, and leukocytosis with bandemia. Her condition is likely to deteriorate further, and it is recommended to withdraw care and focus on comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's brain injury and respiratory depression, there is a high risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to progress, and there is a risk of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and there is a risk of multi-organ failure.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely to worsen, and there is a risk of acidosis-induced cardiac arrest.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely to continue, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction is likely to worsen, and there is a risk of liver failure.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of infection.
9. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of acidosis-induced cardiac arrest.
10. Neurological deterioration: Given the patient's brain injury, there is a risk of further neurological deterioration, including seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and brain herniation.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical interventions to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.  Patient has no
   spontaneous respiration, no albuterol needed.
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.  Patient has no
   spontaneous respiration, no albuterol needed.
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF who was admitted with VT arrest. She was found down in rehab and had a prolonged period of cardiac arrest. She has since been diagnosed with irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, large brain infarct, and acute renal failure. She is also suffering from septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, leukocytosis with bandemia, and lactic acidosis. She has no meaningful response to stimuli and is not expected to recover.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of brain injury: The patient's brain injury is irreversible, and further deterioration is possible.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of c-diff infection and other potential sources of infection.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, and further deterioration is possible.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and NSTEMI, and her EF is 15-20%. She is at risk of developing further cardiac complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator and is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and potential complications from her brain injury.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of c-diff infection and is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, including toxic megacolon.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is at risk of developing hemodynamic instability due to her underlying cardiac and renal disease, as well as potential complications from her brain injury.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system and the presence of indwelling devices.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her care plan accordingly.
2. Continue to manage her sepsis and other potential sources of infection.
3. Monitor her renal function and adjust her fluid management plan accordingly.
4. Continue to manage her cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
5. Monitor her respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
6. Continue to manage her gastrointestinal status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
7. Monitor her hemodynamic status and adjust her fluid management plan accordingly.
8. Consider consulting with a specialist in critical care medicine to help manage the patient's complex medical condition."
