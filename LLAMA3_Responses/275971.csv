   Assessment and Plan
 PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD) WITH CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   78M w DM2, PVD, CAD, afib, intially presented for falls, hospital
   course complicated by MSSA bacteremia from presumed foot source,
   seeding of sternal joint and possibly lumbar epidural space, now with
   new hematemesis.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple
   transfusions yesterday. EGD yesterday am showing ulcer that was
   injected and cauterized, with further recs to continue 48hrs of IV PPI
   and repeat EGD in 6wks with Bx.
   --Pt currently still only with R PICC and L AC PIV, would strongly
   consider another large bore PIV if Hct does not stabilize
   --T&S outdates [**2174-11-15**]
   --Has 2U crossmatched
   --Transfuse for <25 or active bleeding
   --F/u INR this am, is normalizing
   --Continuing IV PPI
   --Will need f/u EGD in 6 wks
   --Zofran prn
   --Advanced diet overnight to clears
   --Avoid narcotics contributing to ileus --> pain currently controlled
   with Tylenol and Fentanyl
   --Continue iron supplementation for chronic iron deficiency component
   (last colonoscopy [**2171**], multiple polypectomy)
   --Holding Lisinopril and Metoprolol, will add back as necessary
   --Has not been getting outpt Lasix regimen in house, will use prn for
   resp distress with transfusions
   .
   #) Bacteremia: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg daily since. Source
   thought to be LE ulcers given x-ray with possibility of lucency/osteo
   vs sternoclavicular joint post trauma given same organism growing
   (unclear which came first). Other sources ruled out with neg UA and
   TEE. Now complicated by lumber MRI concerning for septic facet,
   discitis and paraspinal abscess.
   --Have decreased Cefazolin to 1g IV q8 per ID recs as may have
   contributed to n/v but can increase back to 2g IV q8 if without
   continued n/v
   --Continue nonsurgical management of sternoclavicular joint infection
   per thoracic
   --Per neurosurgery, no plan for intervention given normal neuro exam.
   Recommend repeat MRI with STIR given poor quality of initial film(will
   likely need to be intubated). If clinically worsens consider fluero
   aspiration of L4 fluid by IR.
   -- Regular neuro checks (q4 for now)
   -- consider CT abdomen/pelvis to look for psoas abscess or R foot MR
   for osteo to further eval of source and/or complication
   -- can stop surveillance cultures, f/u prior BCx until finalized
   -- wound care of R plantar foot ulcer per podiatry
   --Was receiving Ketorolac for pain but not well controlled, have now
   switched to Fentanyl
   .
   #) Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   --BS's well controlled in the 100's through yesterday
   --Continue to watch finger sticks
   -- Advanced to clears
   .
   #) Atrial Fibrillation:
   -- Holding coumadin and metoprolol
   --Will need to add back Metoprolol if RVR or HTN
   .
   #) CAD: no active chest pain
   -- continue statin, holding BB, ACEi, ASA
   -- monitor EKGs prn
   -- if active chest pain, decrease threshold for transfusion
   .
   FEN: Advanced to clear overnight, lytes prn, IVF/blood products prn
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx: was supratherapeutic on coumadin, now INR 1.2 but will hold
   subQ heparin given recent bleed
   -Bowel regimen: was held while NPO, have now restarted since taking
   Fentanyl for pain
   -Pain management with: Fentanyl
   .
   ACCESS: PIV, PICC placed [**11-9**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a recent bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), and critical limb ischemia. He has undergone an endoscopy, which revealed a single clean base 2.5cm x 3cm non-bleeding ulcer with a blood clot in the antrum. The clot was flushed away, and epinephrine was injected at the ulcer edge. The patient has also been diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia.

The patient's current medical condition is stable, with a hematocrit (Hct) of 25.9%. He has received 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently receiving IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 48 hours. He has also been prescribed fentanyl for pain control.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 15.5-16.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1-10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 55-107 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2-1.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113-99 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium (Na): 147 mmol/L, potassium (K): 4.5 mmol/L, magnesium (Mg): 1.9 mmol/L, phosphorus (PO4): 3.1 mmol/L
* C-reactive protein (CRP): 215.1 mg/L
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 72 mm/h

The patient's medical complications include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia
* Bacteremia caused by MSSA
* Type 2 diabetes
* Atrial fibrillation
* Coronary artery disease

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Further gastrointestinal bleeding
* Worsening of peripheral vascular disease and critical limb ischemia
* Development of septicemia or sepsis
* Complications related to diabetes, such as ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome
* Complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as stroke or systemic embolism
* Complications related to coronary artery disease, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing IV PPI for 48 hours
* Repeat EGD in 6 weeks with biopsy
* Monitoring of Hct and transfusion requirements
* Pain management with fentanyl
* Monitoring of electrolytes and glucose levels
* Regular neuro checks
* Consideration of repeat MRI with STIR to evaluate for septic facet, discitis, and paraspinal abscess
* Consideration of CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for psoas abscess or R foot MRI for osteo to further evaluate the source and/or complication of the bacteremia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes. The patient is currently admitted to the MICU with hematemesis and a bleeding ulcer, which was visualized during an endoscopy procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 107 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/69 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 25.9 g/dL, platelet count of 55,000/μL, and a white blood cell count of 15.5 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), which was cultured from the patient's joint fluid and wound. The patient is currently receiving intravenous antibiotics, and the culture results are pending.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, fentanyl, and midazolam, and the patient is receiving iron supplementation for chronic iron deficiency.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing intravenous pantoprazole for 48 hours, repeating the endoscopy procedure in six weeks, and obtaining a biopsy of the bleeding ulcer. The patient is also scheduled to receive a wound care consultation and a pain management plan.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the ulcer, which could lead to further hematemesis and hypovolemic shock.
2. Development of septicemia or sepsis, which could be caused by the MSSA bacteremia or other sources.
3. Respiratory distress, which could be caused by the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other underlying respiratory conditions.
4. Cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrest, which could be caused by the patient's underlying cardiac conditions.
5. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, which could be caused by the patient's underlying medical conditions or the use of certain medications.
6. Infection of the sternoclavicular joint or other areas, which could be caused by the MSSA bacteremia or other sources.
7. Development of a paraspinal abscess or other complications related to the patient's lumbar epidural abscess.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   admitted to MICU with hematemesis and s/p EGD with bleeding ulcer
   visualized. It is likely the pt
s continued n/v on the floor was less
   likely due to narcotics and probably due to severe PUD, and the ulcer
   finally opened up.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple
   transfusions yesterday. EGD yesterday am showing ulcer that was
   injected and cauterized, with further recs to continue 48hrs of IV PPI
   and repeat EGD in 6wks with Bx.
   --Not currently symptomatic, no n/v

   consider another large bore PIV if Hct does not stabilize

   discitis and paraspinal abscess.
   --Have decreased Cefazolin to 1g IV q8 per ID recs as may have
   contributed to n/v but will  increase back to 2g IV q8 if without
   continued n/v
   --Continue nonsurgical management of sternoclavicular joint infection
   per thoracic
   --Per neurosurgery, no plan for intervention given normal neuro exam.
   --Pt unlikely to be able to tolerate long MRI without
   intubation/sedation and doubt that visualizing an epidural abscess
   would change the course of an already long course of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will not
   proceed to further imaging of L spine unless neurologically
   deteriorates or pt acutely decompensates.
   --If clinically worsens consider fluero aspiration of L4 fluid by IR.
   -- Regular neuro checks (q4 for now)
   -- consider CT abdomen/pelvis to look for psoas abscess or R foot MR
   for osteo to further eval of source and/or complication
 again, unsure
   this would change course of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on this for now and
   continue IV [**First Name3 (LF) **] as is.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the MICU with hematemesis and a bleeding ulcer visualized on EGD.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) 7.9 g/dL, which is low
* Hematocrit (Hct) 24.1%, which is low
* Platelet count 221 K/uL, which is low
* White blood cell count (WBC) 15.5, which is elevated
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 29 mEq/L, which is high
* Creatinine (Cr) 1.5 mg/dL, which is high
* Electrolyte imbalance, with sodium 147 mEq/L, potassium 4.4 mEq/L, and magnesium 1.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including:

* Cefazolin for bacteremia
* PPI for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Tylenol for pain management
* Lisinopril and Metoprolol, which are being held due to bleeding complications
* Statin for coronary artery disease
* Coumadin, which is being held due to recent bleeding

The patient's clinical status is as follows:

* Hematemesis: intermittent nausea and vomiting, with coffee-ground emesis
* Anemia: acute, secondary to blood loss
* Hypernatremia: high sodium levels
* Peripheral vascular disease: critical limb ischemia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: upper gastrointestinal bleeding
* Pain control: acute pain and chronic pain

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing IV PPI for GERD
* Repeating EGD in 6 weeks with biopsy
* Continuing iron supplementation for chronic iron deficiency
* Holding Lisinopril and Metoprolol, with plans to add back as necessary
* Using prn Lasix for respiratory distress with transfusions
* Continuing Cefazolin for bacteremia
* Decreasing Cefazolin to 1g IV q8 if nausea and vomiting continue
* Continuing nonsurgical management of sternoclavicular joint infection
* Monitoring for septic facet, discitis, and paraspinal abscess
* Considering fluoro aspiration of L4 fluid by IR if clinically worsens
* Holding off on CT abdomen/pelvis and MRI of L spine for now

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding complications due to continued use of anticoagulants
* Infection complications due to bacteremia and septic facet
* Respiratory complications due to hypernatremia and gastrointestinal bleeding
* Cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease
* Renal complications due to hypernatremia and decreased kidney function
* Gastrointestinal complications due to GERD and gastrointestinal bleeding

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's clinical status and laboratory results to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   78M w DM2, PVD, CAD, afib, intially presented for falls, hospital
   course complicated by MSSA bacteremia from presumed foot source,
   seeding of sternal joint and possibly lumbar epidural space, now
   admitted to MICU with hematemesis and s/p EGD with bleeding ulcer
   visualized. It is likely the pt
s continued n/v on the floor was less
   likely due to narcotics and probably due to severe PUD, and the ulcer
   finally opened up.
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple
   transfusions yesterday. EGD yesterday am showing ulcer that was
   injected and cauterized, with further recs to continue 48hrs of IV PPI
   and repeat EGD in 6wks with Bx.
   No current symptoms (no n/v, no hematemesis, no BRBPR, no melena). Now
   s/p 9U without much of an increase in Hct. Was 26 through yesterday and
   seen to be 24 this am.
   --Pt currently still only with R PICC and L AC PIV, would strongly
   consider another large bore PIV if Hct does not stabilize
   --T&S outdates [**2174-11-15**]
   --Has 2U crossmatched
   --Hct checks q6hrs
   --Transfuse for <25 or active bleeding

   discitis and paraspinal abscess.
   --Have decreased Cefazolin to 1g IV q8 per ID recs as may have
   contributed to n/v but will  increase back to 2g IV q8 if without
   continued n/v
   --Continue nonsurgical management of sternoclavicular joint infection

   intubation/sedation and doubt that visualizing an epidural abscess
   would change the course of an already long course of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will not

   for osteo to further eval of source and/or complication
 again, unsure
   this would change course of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off on this for now and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the MICU with hematemesis and a bleeding ulcer, which was visualized during an EGD. He has received multiple transfusions, but his hemoglobin levels have not responded appropriately, currently at 24.6%. He is also experiencing nausea and vomiting, which is likely due to severe peptic ulcer disease.

The patient has a history of bacteremia, which was caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and was thought to be related to a foot ulcer. However, further imaging revealed a possible septic facet, discitis, and paraspinal abscess in the lumbar spine.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for his conditions, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and iron supplementation. He is also receiving pain management with fentanyl and Tylenol.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin levels have not responded to transfusions, and he may require further intervention to control bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and may be at risk for further infections, particularly in the lumbar spine.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, which may increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease and may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of septic facet, discitis, and paraspinal abscess, which may increase his risk for neurological complications, such as spinal cord compression or meningitis.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, particularly if he develops further infections or cardiac complications.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his hemoglobin levels and transfusing as necessary. Additionally, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of infection, cardiovascular complications, gastrointestinal complications, neurological complications, and respiratory complications."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   78M w DM2, PVD, CAD, afib, intially presented for falls, hospital
   course complicated by MSSA bacteremia from presumed foot source,
   seeding of sternal joint and possibly lumbar epidural space, now
   admitted to MICU with hematemesis and s/p EGD with bleeding ulcer
   visualized. It is likely the pt
s continued n/v on the floor was less
   likely due to narcotics and probably due to severe PUD, and the ulcer
   finally opened up.
   #) Hematemesis: Intermittent n/v through admission, previously
   nonbloody, then developed coffee ground emesis. Is now s/p 9U although
   Hct doesn't appear to have corrected appropriately with Hct initially
   falling after first transfusion and currently at 26.5 after multriple
   transfusions yesterday. EGD yesterday am showing ulcer that was
   injected and cauterized, with further recs to continue 48hrs of IV PPI
   and repeat EGD in 6wks with Bx.
   No current symptoms (no n/v, no hematemesis, no BRBPR, no melena). Now
   s/p 8U without much of an increase in Hct. Was 26 through yesterday and
   seen to be 24 this am, so will transfuse the 9U this am and f/u Hct. If
   stable, will call out.
   --Pt currently still only with R PICC and L AC PIV, would strongly
   consider another large bore PIV if Hct does not stabilize
   --T&S outdates [**2174-11-15**]
   --Has 2U crossmatched
   --Hct checks q6hrs
   --Transfuse for <25 or active bleeding
   --F/u INR this am, is normalizing
   --Have converted IV PPI to PO PPI
   --F/u H pylori serology
   --Will need f/u EGD in 6 wks
   --Zofran prn
   --Advanced diet overnight to clears without complications
   .
   #) Bacteremia: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg daily since. Source
   thought to be LE ulcers given x-ray with possibility of lucency/osteo
   vs sternoclavicular joint post trauma given same organism growing
   (unclear which came first). Other sources ruled out with neg UA and
   TEE. Now complicated by lumber MRI concerning for septic facet,
   discitis and paraspinal abscess.
   Thoracic and Neuro have recommended ABx course for sternoclavicular
   infection and possible lumbar infection as no active neuro signs
   currently. Will continue current ABx course for 6 wks. Today is day 8,
   started [**2174-11-8**].
   --Cefazolin back up to 2g IV q8 after briefly being dropped to 1g IV q8
   due to concern that it was contributing to n/v.
   #) Pain
We were avoiding narcotics as they were thought to be
   contributing to n/v, but with EGD evidence of bleeding ulcer, it seems
   more likely that the ulcer/blood was causing his n/v and not the
   narcotics. Therefore were giving him Fentanyl but yesterday also
   received Percocet with good effect and will continue Percocet and
   frequent repositioning for pain control.
   #) Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   --BS's well controlled in the 100's through yesterday
   --Continue to watch finger sticks
   -- Advanced to clears
   .
   #) Atrial Fibrillation:
   -- Holding coumadin due to recent GIB
   -- Have added back Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   .
   #) CAD: no active chest pain
   -- continue statin, holding BB, ACEi, ASA
   -- monitor EKGs prn
   -- if active chest pain, decrease threshold for transfusion
   FEN: Advanced to clear overnight, lytes prn, IVF/blood products prn
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx: was supratherapeutic on coumadin, so stopped in setting of
   bleed, now INR 1.2. Will restart subQ heparin
   -Bowel regimen: was held while NPO, have now restarted since taking
   Fentanyl for pain
   -Pain management with: Fentanyl and Tylenol
   ACCESS: PIV, PICC placed [**11-9**]
 if brisk bleed, may need second

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #) Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   --BS's well controlled in the 100's through yesterday
   --Continue to watch finger sticks
   -- Advanced to clears
   .
   #) Atrial Fibrillation:
   -- Holding coumadin due to recent GIB
   -- Have added back Metoprolol 25 PO bid
   .
   #) CAD: no active chest pain
   -- continue statin, holding BB, ACEi, ASA
   -- monitor EKGs prn
   -- if active chest pain, decrease threshold for transfusion
   FEN: Advanced to clear overnight, lytes prn, IVF/blood products prn
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx: was supratherapeutic on coumadin, so stopped in setting of
   bleed, now INR 1.2. Will restart subQ heparin
   -Bowel regimen: was held while NPO, have now restarted since taking
   Fentanyl for pain
   -Pain management with: Fentanyl and Tylenol
   ACCESS: PIV, PICC placed [**11-9**]
 if brisk bleed, may need second

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently admitted to the MICU with hematemesis and a bleeding ulcer, which was visualized during an EGD procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 92/47 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula, and his respiratory rate is 9 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.1%
* White blood cell count: 15.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 221 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 29 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 113 mg/dL
* Sodium: 147 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia, which was detected on November 6th. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's pain is being managed with Fentanyl and Tylenol, and he is receiving proton pump inhibitors for his bleeding ulcer.

The patient's fluid status is a concern, with a total fluid balance of -750 mL over the past 24 hours. His urine output is 3,340 mL, and his blood products transfusion is pending.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Hypernatremia (high sodium)
* Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia
* Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB)
* Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
* Atrial fibrillation

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Bleeding complications due to his bleeding ulcer and anemia
* Infection complications due to his bacteremia and possible septic facet, discitis, and paraspinal abscess
* Cardiovascular complications due to his atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease
* Neurological complications due to his lumbar MRI findings

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia
* Monitoring his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
* Transfusing blood products as needed
* Managing his pain with Fentanyl and Tylenol
* Continuing anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
* Monitoring his fluid status and urine output
* Considering additional large bore IV access if his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels do not stabilize
* Following up on his H pylori serology results
* Scheduling a follow-up EGD in 6 weeks

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is hematemesis, and they have a history of type II diabetes, anemia, peripheral vascular disease, gastrointestinal bleed, and pain.

Physiological Parameters:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate is 92 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 112/79 mmHg, respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and their blood pressure is within the normal range.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,590 mL of fluids and has lost 3,340 mL of fluids, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 750 mL.

Lab Results:

* Hemoglobin: 7.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 15.5-16.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 221 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 86-113 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Sodium 147 mEq/L, potassium 4.4 mEq/L, magnesium 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphate 3.1 mg/dL

Assessment and Plan:

* The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, nausea and vomiting, anemia, hypernatremia, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, gastrointestinal bleed, and pain.
* The patient is being treated with proton pump inhibitors and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
* The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.
* The patient's hemoglobin is slowly decreasing, and they are being transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells.
* The patient's pain is being managed, and their nausea has largely resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Further bleeding and anemia
* Worsening of peripheral vascular disease and critical limb ischemia
* Hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalances
* Gastrointestinal bleed and potential for perforation or bleeding
* Pain and discomfort
* Infection and sepsis
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation and potential for cardiac arrest

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and provide prompt intervention."
