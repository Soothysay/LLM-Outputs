   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old man with likely microscopic polyangiitis and now with
   transient fevers and hypoxia of unclear etiology, now transferred to
   the MICU service for ongoing care.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Fevers: unclear etiology; could be pneumonia, though must rule out
   vasculitis-related etiologies
   - cont empiric levofloxacin; f/u pending micro data from here and
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - bronchoscopy this afternoon to eval for alveolar hemorrhage; send BAL
   for micro
   - f/u beta-D-glucan, galactomannan, parvovirus, CMV serologies;
   - Legionella antigen and Lyme serologies negative
   - prn meperidine for rigors
   .
   ## Microscopic polyangiitis
   - rheumatology consult called this morning by CCU team; f/u recs
   - cont prednisone 60 mg daily for now pending rheum recs; TMP/SMX for
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]; vitamin D/calcium for bone prophylaxis
   - f/u ANCA titer
   .
   ## Hypoxia; transient with fevers/rigors
   - bronchoscopy this afternoon
   - follow CXRs
   .
   ## Pancytopenia: leukopenia and anemia seemingly have resolved this
   morning, though wonder if this could be a lab artifact given marked
   change in Hgb/Hct; likely a sequela of azathioprine use
   - cont holding azathioprine for now
   - recheck CBC
   - f/u parasite smear for Babesia, SPEP/UPEP
   - consider heme consult if persistent
   - add on LDH, reticulocyte count, TBili, haptoglobin
   .
   ## CAD s/p CABG; minor troponin-T elevation likely from acute medical
   stressors and not representative of ACS/NSTEMI
   - cont aspirin; resume beta blocker once stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation
   - cont warfarin
   - cont holding beta blockade for now given possibility of ongoing
   infection
   - follow INR given antibiotics most likely to change it
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a diagnosis of likely microscopic polyangiitis, who was transferred to the MICU service for ongoing care. The patient has been experiencing transient fevers and hypoxia of unclear etiology, which is being investigated with bronchoscopy and laboratory tests.

The patient has a history of cardiac disease, including CAD and a recent CABG, as well as atrial fibrillation. He is also taking anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a blood pressure of 68 mmHg, with a heart rate of 100 beats per minute.
* Respiratory support includes oxygen therapy, with an ABG showing a partial pressure of oxygen of 25 mmHg.
* The patient has a positive stool guaiac, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.
* The patient has a positive urine analysis, with RBCs and a cytology report pending.
* The patient has a pancytopenia, with leukopenia and anemia, which has seemingly resolved this morning.
* The patient has a minor troponin-T elevation, likely due to acute medical stressors and not representative of ACS/NSTEMI.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia, which could be related to vasculitis or other underlying conditions.
* Alveolar hemorrhage, which could be related to vasculitis or other underlying conditions.
* Pancytopenia, which could be a sequela of azathioprine use or another underlying condition.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be related to vasculitis or other underlying conditions.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, which could be related to underlying cardiac disease or other conditions.
* Infection, which could be related to underlying conditions or other factors.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the plan of care includes:

* Empiric levofloxacin therapy for pneumonia.
* Bronchoscopy to evaluate for alveolar hemorrhage and send BAL for micro.
* Follow-up beta-D-glucan, galactomannan, parvovirus, and CMV serologies.
* Prn meperidine for rigors.
* Rheumatology consult to evaluate for microscopic polyangiitis.
* Cont prednisone 60 mg daily for now pending rheum recs.
* TMP/SMX for PCP.
* Vitamin D/calcium for bone prophylaxis.
* F/u ANCA titer.
* Pancytopenia workup, including recheck CBC, parasite smear for Babesia, SPEP/UPEP, and consider heme consult if persistent.
* Add on LDH, reticulocyte count, TBili, haptoglobin.
* CAD s/p CABG: cont aspirin; resume beta blocker once stable.
* Atrial fibrillation: cont warfarin; cont holding beta blockade for now given possibility of ongoing infection; follow INR given antibiotics most likely to change it.
* FEN: NPO pending bronchoscopy.
* Prophylaxis: therapeutic on warfarin; on ppi.
* Access: peripheral IVs.
* Communication: with patient.
* Code: Full.
* Disposition: ICU."
