   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - recheck INR in afternoon, consider restarting coumadin if INR
   decreased <2.3, once bleed stabilized.
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam difficult to
   assess for expansion of hematoma.
   - recheck Hct now, then noon Hct
   - monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma,
   monitor vitals (BP, HR)
   - tranfuse today if Hct < 30 due to active bleeding
   - repeat CT scan to make sure hematoma is not enlarging and f/u final
   read of CT abdomen/pelvis from yesterday
   - Pain control with Tylenol #3
   - Check afternoon Coags; if INR<2.3, and bleed stabilized, consider
   restarting coumadin
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   - monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - resolved
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated
   .
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.
   .
   #FEN: Cardiac Heart healthy diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 79-year-old female who underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure yesterday and is currently in sinus rhythm. She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient developed a large pelvic hematoma post-procedure, which was measured at 12x5 cm on CT scan. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) post-procedure, and her hemoglobin (Hct) increased from 29.4 to 36.0, but the 3am labs showed an Hct of 31.9, indicating continued bleeding.

The patient is currently on sotalol 120mg PO BID, and her INR is 2.8. She is being monitored for signs of bleeding or expansion of the hematoma, and her physical exam is being assessed for signs of bleeding or overload. The patient is also being monitored for signs of atrial fibrillation, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) is being rechecked in the morning.

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 31.9%
* Platelet count: 178 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 14.9 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 15 mg/dL
* Sodium: 136 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the pelvic hematoma, which could lead to hypovolemic shock or anemia.
2. Expansion of the hematoma, which could lead to compression of surrounding structures, such as the bladder or rectum.
3. Overload or pulmonary edema, which could occur if the patient's heart function is compromised.
4. Infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection, which could be exacerbated by the patient's underlying medical conditions.
5. Development of atrial fibrillation, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or stroke.
6. Hypotension, which could lead to decreased organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
7. Renal insufficiency or failure, which could occur if the patient's creatinine levels continue to rise.

To prevent or manage these complications, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, expansion of the hematoma, overload, infection, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, and renal insufficiency. The patient's medication regimen should be adjusted as necessary to optimize her cardiac function and prevent bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   - Recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Recheck INR in afternoon, restart coumadin if INR decreased <2.3,
   once bleed stabilized
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam indicates no
   expansion, of hematoma suggesting stablization.
   - f/u Hct at 9am, then noon Hct
   -Monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis

   -Monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   -strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - monitor hemodynamics
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female who underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure and developed a large pelvic hematoma. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm and has an INR of 2.8. She is being treated with sotalol and coumadin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.5°F, blood pressure of 131/64 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on 2L of nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a tender abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant, which is likely related to the pelvic hematoma. Her femoral sites are oozing, and she has no evidence of stasis dermatitis or ulcers.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 31.9 g/dL, which is lower than expected given the 2 units of packed red blood cells she received post-procedure. Her platelet count is 178 K/uL, and her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include restarting sotalol at a lower dose, rechecking her ECG and INR, and monitoring her physical examination for signs of bleeding or expansion of the pelvic hematoma. She will also receive pain control with Tylenol #3 and have her Hct monitored at 9 am and noon.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's pelvic hematoma may continue to expand, causing bleeding complications.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's INR is therapeutic, but she is at risk for developing thrombosis due to her atrial fibrillation and the use of coumadin.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she may experience hypotension due to her hypovolemia and the use of vasopressors.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is normal, but she may experience respiratory complications due to her atrial fibrillation and the use of sedatives.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdomen is tender, and she may experience gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
6. Infection: The patient's pelvic hematoma may become infected, causing sepsis and other complications.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, causing cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
8. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is normal, but she may experience renal complications due to her hypovolemia and the use of diuretics.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   currently in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt continues to be
   therapeutic on coumadin with INR 2.8 this morning
   - restart sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] (home dose is 160mg PO BID)
   per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - recheck INR in afternoon, consider restarting coumadin if INR
   decreased <2.3, once bleed stabilized.
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure. Measured at 12x 5 cm
   on CT wet read, with no retroperitoneal bleeding. 2 units PRBC given
   post-procedure, Hct bumped initially to 2 units from 29.4-> 36.0, but
   3am labs show Hct 31.9. 3am Hct of 31.9 likely more indicative of Hct
   after equilibration, indicating Hct did not increase appropriately. In
   the setting of hemodilution with IVF during/after procedure and
   therapeutic INR, she may have continued bleeding. Exam difficult to
   assess for expansion of hematoma.
   - recheck Hct now, then noon Hct
   - monitor physical exam for signs of bleeding or expansion of hematoma,
   monitor vitals (BP, HR)
   - tranfuse today if Hct < 30 due to active bleeding
   - repeat CT scan to make sure hematoma is not enlarging and f/u final
   read of CT abdomen/pelvis from yesterday
   - Pain control with Tylenol #3
   - Check afternoon Coags; if INR<2.3, and bleed stabilized, consider
   restarting coumadin
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   - monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   # TRANSIENT HYPOTENSION: During procedure became hypotensive, on
   transfer was on 0.8 of neosynephrine, but weaned off pressors soon
   after arrival.
   - resolved
   - if remains stable, w/ SBPs >120, restart metoprolol and valsartan as
   tolerated
   .
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   .
   #  Hyperlipidemia: stable; not currently treated with statins.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female who underwent atrial fibrillation ablation procedure yesterday. She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Post-procedure, she developed a large pelvic hematoma, which was managed with 2 units of packed red blood cells. She is currently in sinus rhythm and is being treated with sotalol. Her hemoglobin level is 31.9%, and her INR is 2.8. She is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding or expansion of the hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's pelvic hematoma may continue to expand or bleed, which could lead to hypovolemic shock, renal failure, or other complications.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 2.8, which is therapeutic for anticoagulation, but may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may recur, and her cardiac function may be compromised due to the procedure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to her age, underlying medical conditions, and potential complications from the procedure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her catheterization and potential bleeding complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's hypovolemic shock or coagulopathy may lead to acute kidney injury or renal failure.
7. Metabolic complications: The patient's glycemic control may be compromised due to her hyperlipidemia and potential bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and INR to ensure that they are within therapeutic ranges.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, to detect any signs of bleeding or hypovolemic shock.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain with Tylenol #3 and monitor her for signs of pain or discomfort.
4. Consider restarting coumadin if the patient's INR decreases to <2.3 and the bleeding has stabilized.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and rhythm to detect any signs of atrial fibrillation recurrence.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider transfusing blood products if the patient's hemoglobin level decreases to <30.
8. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider correcting any imbalances.
9. Consider consulting with a cardiothoracic surgeon if the patient's bleeding complications are severe or life-threatening."

   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure in setting of
   therapeutic INR on coumadin. Expanded in size from 12x 5 cm
  14.7 x
   6.8cm on CT wet read  yesterday late morning (~20% increase),
   indicating continued bleeding. 2 units PRBC and Vit K given early
   afternoon, Hct bumped ~3.6 points to 32.8, but 9pm labs showed Hct
   28.1. Transfused another 2 units last night, 3am Hct of 34.3, which may
   be too early to reflect Hct after equilibration. If morning Hct comes
   down below 32.1, likely she has continuing bleeding into hematoma in
   setting of elevated INR. Total Units given =6 this hospital admission.

   - Pain control with Hydrocodone
   - Check morning Coags; last INR 1.8 <2.0; consider restarting coumadin
   to prevent thrombosis when Hct stable
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient has
   been stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt
s INR 1.8<2.0, below
   therapeutic range on coumadin; should be therapeutic to prevent
   thrombosis in setting of recent atrial ablation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with abdominal and pelvic pain and was found to have a large pelvic hematoma, likely a complication of a percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) procedure.

The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 123/51 mmHg and a heart rate of 74 beats per minute. Her respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, a platelet count of 178 K/uL, and an INR of 1.8. Her white blood cell count is 14.9 K/uL, and her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's abdominal and pelvic exam is notable for a tender abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and a large pelvic hematoma that has increased in size by approximately 20% over the past 24 hours.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of her hemodynamic status, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation
* Serial hemoglobin levels to assess for ongoing bleeding
* Pain control with hydrocodone as needed
* Transfusion of blood products if her hemoglobin level falls below 30 g/dL
* Consultation with vascular or interventional radiology if active bleeding continues
* Restarting warfarin once bleeding is stabilized to prevent thrombosis
* Monitoring of her cardiac rhythm and restarting sotalol at a lower dose once bleeding is stabilized

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding into the pelvic hematoma, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction
* Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of therapeutic INR on coumadin
* Infection of the pelvic hematoma, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Cardiac complications, such as atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of sotalol
* Renal insufficiency or failure due to the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Complication of PVI procedure in setting of
   therapeutic INR on coumadin. Expanded in size from 12x 5 cm
  14.7 x
   6.8cm on CT wet read  yesterday late morning (~20% increase),
   indicating continued bleeding. 2 units PRBC and Vit K given early
   afternoon, Hct bumped ~3.6 points to 32.8, but 9pm labs showed Hct
   28.1. Transfused another 2 units last night, 3am Hct of 34.3, which may
   be too early to reflect Hct after equilibration. If morning Hct comes
   down below 32.1, likely she has continuing bleeding into hematoma in
   setting of elevated INR. Total Units given =6 this hospital admission.
   - recheck 7:30 Hct, follow serial Hct
s q 6 hours
   - monitor physical exam for increasing abdominal distension, monitor
   vitals (BP, HR)
   - transfuse today if Hct < 30 due to active bleeding.
   -If active bleeding continues, get Vascular or IR consult
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis from yesterday
   - Pain control with Oxycodone
   - Check morning Coags; last INR 1.8 <2.0; consider restarting coumadin
   to prevent thrombosis when Hct stable
   - Check Lactate secondary to severe tenderness.
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient has
   been stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB. Pt
s INR 1.8<2.0, below
   therapeutic range on coumadin; should be therapeutic to prevent
   thrombosis in setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Restart coumadin once bleeding stabilized.
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears euvolemic, no evidence of
   overload on exam. Exam c/w adequate peripheral perfusion.
   - monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, daily weights
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently BP
s in 110-130
s, controlled on meds.
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She has a large pelvic hematoma (14.7 x 6.8 cm) that is expanding and bleeding, as evidenced by the increase in hematocrit (Hct) from 32.8 to 34.3. The patient has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and vitamin K, and her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.8, which is below the therapeutic range.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Continued bleeding into the pelvic hematoma, leading to further expansion and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Hypovolemic shock due to blood loss and decreased blood volume.
3. Thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the elevated INR and decreased blood flow.
4. Infection or sepsis due to the presence of a foreign body (catheter) and the patient's compromised immune status.
5. Respiratory failure due to the patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and potential respiratory compromise from the pelvic hematoma.
6. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's pre-existing atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac compromise from blood loss.
7. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to the patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and potential cerebral hypoperfusion.
8. Intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome due to the expanding pelvic hematoma and potential abdominal distension.
9. Renal failure due to the patient's age, underlying medical conditions, and potential decreased renal perfusion.
10. Wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence, due to the patient's surgical history and compromised immune status.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of the pelvic hematoma and bleeding via serial hematocrit checks and imaging studies.
2. Transfusion of additional PRBC as needed to maintain a stable hematocrit.
3. Monitoring of the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
4. Pain management with oxycodone as needed.
5. Restarting coumadin once bleeding is stabilized to prevent thrombosis.
6. Monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels and potential acid-base imbalance.
7. Strict input and output monitoring to ensure adequate fluid balance.
8. Daily weights and monitoring of peripheral perfusion to assess for signs of overload.
9. Regular monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm and potential arrhythmias.
10. Close communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure coordinated care and management of potential complications."

   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding ongoing with Hcts continuing to drop slowly
   in setting of elevated but not therapeutic INR. 1 unit PRBC given
   overnight, Hct bumped from 28.0 to 31.6 this morning, showing
   appropriate increase; possibly indicates decreased bleeding. Normal
   lactate indicates no abdominal ischemia. Total Units given =7 this
   hospital admission.
   - follow serial Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   in setting of elevated but not therapeutic INR. 1 unit PRBC given
   overnight, Hct bumped from 28.0 to 31.6 this morning, showing
   appropriate increase; possibly indicates decreased bleeding. Normal
   lactate indicates no abdominal ischemia. Total Units given =7 this
   hospital admission.
   - follow serial Hct
s q 6 hours
   - transfuse again if Hct < 30 indicating active bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a large pelvic hematoma. She has been in the ICU for several days and has received multiple units of blood transfusions. Her hemoglobin levels have been trending downward, but have stabilized recently. She is currently in sinus rhythm, but has a history of atrial fibrillation and has undergone a procedure for atrial fibrillation ablation. She has also been experiencing crackles in her lungs and has been given lasix for fluid overload. Her electrolyte levels are slightly depleted, and she is being repleted with potassium and magnesium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin levels are still trending downward, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient may require additional transfusions and/or surgical intervention to control the bleeding.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient's lungs are showing signs of fluid overload, and she is at risk for further complications if this is not addressed. Additional diuretic therapy may be necessary to manage her fluid status.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly depleted, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Close monitoring and repletion with potassium and magnesium are necessary.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling lines and the presence of a pelvic hematoma. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment if necessary are crucial.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her current use of coumadin make her at risk for thrombosis. Close monitoring of her INR levels and adjustment of her anticoagulation therapy as necessary are important.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her current use of sotalol make her at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart block. Close monitoring of her cardiac status and adjustment of her medications as necessary are important.
7. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's lungs are showing signs of fluid overload, and she is at risk for further complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and prompt treatment if necessary are crucial."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding ongoing with Hcts continuing to drop slowly
   in setting of elevated but not therapeutic INR. 1 unit PRBC given
   overnight, Hct bumped from 28.0 to 31.6 this morning, showing
   appropriate increase; possibly indicates decreased bleeding. Normal
   lactate indicates no abdominal ischemia. Total Units given =7 this
   hospital admission.
   - follow serial Hct
s q 6 hours
   - transfuse again if Hct < 27 indicating active bleeding, one unit
   RBCs, with lasix
   -If active bleeding continues, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - monitor physical exam for increasing abdominal distension, monitor
   vitals (BP, HR)
   - f/u final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Pain control with Oxycodone
   - Check Coags; last INR 1.3 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent
   thrombosis per EP recs
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient has
   been stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and Pt having occasional
   PACs since this morning. Pt
s INR 1.3<2.0, below therapeutic range on
   coumadin; continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent
   thrombosis in setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs
   - recheck ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - Continue coumadin unless bleeding increased.
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt appears hypervolemic, evidence of
   overload on exam w/ bibasilar crackles, subjective SOB. UOP with 10mg
   IV lasix was good. Likely due to 7units of blood given.
   -If continues with crackles, give additional 10mg IV bolus of lasix

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who has developed a large pelvic hematoma after undergoing a PVI procedure for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been trending downward, from 34.3 to 28.0, indicating ongoing bleeding. Despite receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight, the Hct has continued to drop. The patient's lactate level is normal, indicating no abdominal ischemia. The patient has received a total of 7 units of blood during her hospital admission.

The patient's INR is 1.3, which is below the therapeutic range. Coumadin has been restarted to prevent thrombosis per EP recommendations. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus rhythm, with occasional premature atrial contractions (PACs).

The patient's physical examination is notable for bilateral crackles at the bases, which are likely due to hypervolemia. The patient has received 10mg of IV lasix and has had a good urine output. The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly depleted, with magnesium and potassium levels below normal. The patient's blood pressure is controlled on medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's Hct is still trending downward, indicating ongoing bleeding. Further transfusions may be necessary to stabilize the patient's hemoglobin level.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, which increases the risk of thrombosis. Coumadin should be continued to prevent thrombosis per EP recommendations.
3. Hypervolemia: The patient's physical examination is notable for bilateral crackles at the bases, which are likely due to hypervolemia. Further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly depleted, with magnesium and potassium levels below normal. Repletion with IV magnesium and potassium may be necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's ECG shows sinus rhythm, with occasional PACs. Further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Follow serial Hct to monitor for ongoing bleeding.
2. Transfuse additional PRBCs if Hct < 27, with lasix.
3. Monitor physical exam for increasing abdominal distension and monitor vital signs (BP, HR).
4. Follow up on final read of CT abdomen/pelvis.
5. Continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis.
6. Continue sotalol at a lower dose of 120mg per EP recommendations.
7. Recheck ECG in the morning and monitor on tele.
8. Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload and strict I/Os with goal of down 1 L, daily weights."

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding appears stable with Hcts continuing in low
   30
s; slight drop this a.m. to 29.8, but has been stable throughout day
   yesterday.  INR up to 1.9, increasing risk for rebleeding. Total Units
   given =7 this hospital admission.
   - check Hct at 2pm today, then follow serial Hct
s as indicated
   - transfuse again if Hct < 27 indicating active bleeding, one unit
   RBCs, with lasix
   - Decrease Coumadin to 5mg po daily as INR approaching therapeutic
   level
   - If active bleeding restarts, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - Pain control with Oxycodone PRN
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   continues to be stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and  occasional
   PACs. Pt
s INR 1.9<2.0, just below therapeutic range on coumadin;
   continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis in
   setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs. Ask for recs
   re: home dosing of sotalol.
   - ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - last INR 1.9 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent thrombosis, but
   decrease dose to 5mg q day
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt still appears hypervolemic w/ JVD
   [**12-3**], but sx decreased since yesterday; no continued subjective SOB.
   UOP with 10mg IV lasix x2 yesterday was good. Overload likely result of
   7units of blood given.
   - If O2 sats drop <93%, give another 10mg IV lasix
   - Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, with goal of  down 500mL, daily weights
   .
   #L THIGH NUMBNESS: Pt describes numbness on L lateral thigh, which is
   similar to a previous sensation during episode of back pain.
   Distribution is L lateral cutaneous nerve/L2-L3. In setting of
   decreased INR over previous few days and risk of thrombosis due to L
   atrial ablation procedure, must consider thrombosis as etiology.
   However, considering no other signs of thromosis, no pain, good pulses,
   warm extremities, no skin changes, this is unlikely thrombotic event.
   Considering previous episode and specific nerve distribution, more
   likely nerve impingement vs sciatic sx.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently BP
s in 110-130
s, controlled on meds.
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   # Constipation: 1 BM achieved; colon not obstructed by hematoma
   - Continue bowel regimen w/ miralax.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   79-year-old female with a longstanding history of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation, HTN, and hyperlipidemia with increasing symptomatic afib
   s/p PVI c/b large pelvic hematoma.
   .
   # PELVIC HEMATOMA: Bleeding appears stable with Hcts continuing in low
   30
s; slight drop this a.m. to 29.8, but has been stable throughout day
   yesterday.  INR up to 1.9, increasing risk for rebleeding. Total Units
   given =7 this hospital admission.
   - check Hct at 2pm today, then follow serial Hct
s as indicated
   - transfuse again if Hct < 27 indicating active bleeding, one unit
   RBCs, with lasix
   - Decrease Coumadin to 5mg po daily as INR approaching therapeutic
   level
   - If active bleeding restarts, consider Vascular or IR consult
   - Pain control with Oxycodone PRN
   .
   # RHYTHM: s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation. After procedure, patient
   continues to be stable in sinus rhythm, with old LBBB, and  occasional
   PACs. Pt
s INR 1.9<2.0, just below therapeutic range on coumadin;
   continue coumadin to achieve therapeutic INR to prevent thrombosis in
   setting of recent atrial ablation.
   - Continue sotalol at lower dose of 120 [**Hospital1 **] per EP recs. Ask for recs
   re: home dosing of sotalol.
   - ECG in am, monitor on tele
   - last INR 1.9 <2.0; continue coumadin to prevent thrombosis, but
   decrease dose to 5mg q day
   .
   # PUMP: Pt has preserved EF>60%. Pt still appears hypervolemic w/ JVD
   [**12-3**], but sx decreased since yesterday; no continued subjective SOB.
   UOP with 10mg IV lasix x2 yesterday was good. Overload likely result of
   7units of blood given.
   - If O2 sats drop <93%, give another 10mg IV lasix
   - Continue to monitor clinical exam for signs of overload
   - strict I/Os, with goal of  down 500mL, daily weights
   .
   #L THIGH NUMBNESS: Pt describes numbness on L lateral thigh, which is
   similar to a previous sensation during episode of back pain.
   Distribution is L lateral cutaneous nerve/L2-L3. In setting of
   decreased INR over previous few days and risk of thrombosis due to L
   atrial ablation procedure, must consider thrombosis as etiology.
   However, considering no other signs of thromosis, no pain, good pulses,
   warm extremities, no skin changes, this is unlikely thrombotic event.
   Considering previous episode and specific nerve distribution, more
   likely nerve impingement vs sciatic sx.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   # CORONARIES: Status of coronaries not documented; had cath in past,
   but results unknown, no mention of CAD or PCI. Risk factors include HTN
   and hyperlipidemia.
   .
   #Hypertension: Currently BP
s in 110-130
s, controlled on meds.
   # GERD: not currently active.
   - continue ranitidine 150mg PO BID.
   # Constipation: 1 BM achieved; colon not obstructed by hematoma
   - Continue bowel regimen w/ miralax.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a large pelvic hematoma after a pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure. She has been in the ICU for several days and has had a stable hematoma with decreasing hemoglobin levels. Her INR has increased to 1.9, which is above the therapeutic range, increasing the risk of rebleeding. She has also developed numbness on her left lateral thigh, which is similar to a previous episode of back pain. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and GERD, but these conditions are currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebleeding: The patient's INR is above the therapeutic range, which increases the risk of rebleeding from the pelvic hematoma. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed is essential.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's INR is above the therapeutic range, which increases the risk of thrombosis. Monitoring for signs of thrombosis, such as pain, swelling, or warmth in her extremities, is essential.
3. Nerve impingement: The patient's numbness on her left lateral thigh could be due to nerve impingement. Monitoring for signs of worsening numbness or pain is essential.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her anticoagulation therapy and history of pelvic hematoma. Monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or cough, is essential.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her prolonged hospital stay and presence of central lines. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased white blood cell count, is essential.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GERD and current use of antacids increases her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, is essential.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current use of anticoagulation therapy increases her risk of cardiac complications, such as stroke or heart failure. Monitoring for signs of cardiac complications, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output, is essential."

   atrial ablation procedure, must consider thrombosis as etiology.
   However, considering no other signs of thromosis, no pain, good pulses,

   Considering previous episode and specific nerve distribution, more
   likely nerve impingement vs sciatic sx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with a large pelvic hematoma and underwent a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. She continues to experience numbness on her left lateral thigh, which is similar to a previous episode of back pain. Her INR is 1.9, increasing her risk for rebleeding. Her hemoglobin has been trending downwards, but stabilized today at 29.8%. She is on various medications, including warfarin, sotalol, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rebleeding: The patient's INR is 1.9, increasing her risk for rebleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion of blood products if necessary.
2. Thrombosis: The patient's numbness on her left lateral thigh could be related to a thrombotic event, although it is unlikely given the absence of other symptoms. Monitor for signs of thrombosis, such as pain, swelling, or skin changes.
3. Hypervolemia: The patient's JVP is 12-3 cm, indicating hypervolemia. Monitor for signs of overload, such as increased JVP, peripheral edema, or decreased urine output. Consider diuresis with lasix if necessary.
4. Thromboembolic complications: The patient's atrial ablation procedure increases her risk for thromboembolic complications, such as pulmonary embolism or stroke. Monitor for signs of thromboembolic events, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or altered mental status.
5. Infection: The patient's pelvic hematoma increases her risk for infection. Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or increased white blood cell count.
6. Constipation: The patient's bowel regimen includes miralax, but she has only had one bowel movement. Monitor for signs of constipation, such as abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in bowel habits.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is stable, but she is not currently being treated with statins. Monitor for signs of hyperlipidemia, such as increased cholesterol levels or xanthomas.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is controlled on medication, but monitor for signs of uncontrolled hypertension, such as headache, blurred vision, or increased blood pressure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring for potential medical complications related to her pelvic hematoma, atrial ablation procedure, and underlying medical conditions."
