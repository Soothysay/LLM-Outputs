   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
   #. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   pneumonia, PE, and leukostasis.  CXR shows small right pleural effusion
   and right upper lung airway disease.  Patient afebrile with scant
   sputum, however, and new lung findings developed while on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics.  D-dimer neg so PE unlikely, though assay
   can be falsely low when patient is anticoagulated, as Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 4948**] was
   (PTT 75 at time of test).  Leukostasis also a concern given profound
   leukocytosis, though no headaches or visual changes on exam.  Heme/onc
   thinks leukostasis unlikely but will treat empirically.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - heme/onc does not believe leukapheresis indicated at this time
   - consider bronch and biopsy
   - consider LENIs
   - consider repeat D-dimer off heparin
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   #. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Concerning for
   infection vs steroid-effect vs known C. diff infection effect vs
   progression or transformation of leukemia.  Per onc, in patient's with
   CMML, white counts can rise significantly in setting of infection.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool cx
   - antibiotics as above and po flagyl for C. diff
   - flow cytometry
   - consider ID c/s (reccomended by heme/onc)
   - follow up results of bone marrow biopsy performed at [**Hospital3 **]
   - Treating with Hydrea 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] to bring down WBC count acutely.
   #. Right sided pulmonary infiltrate:  Developed during hospitalization
   at [**Hospital1 **] so will treat empirically for HAP but concerned about
   leukostasis as above.
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - sputum cx
   - heme/onc eval as above
   #. Atypical chest pain:  Symptoms fit an anginal pattern, with
   worsening left chest pain with activity, but no EKG changes or
   q-waves.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to lung process vs MSK.
   - continue to follow
   #. C. diff:  Began four days after starting vanc/levo at [**Hospital1 **] and
   treated with po vancomycin per renal reccs by their consult service.
   - will treat with po flagyl alone and not continue po vanc
   #. Rectal mass:  Biopsied at [**Hospital1 **] by surgery under anesthesia.  Not
   visually apparent on exam.
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   #. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Has not received chemotherapy for this.  [**Month (only) 8**] be related to
   history of cyclophosphamide for membranous nephropathy.
   - f/u heme/onc reccs
   #. Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy.
   - renally dose meds

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), is being transferred to a new hospital for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated since admission, with development of a small right pleural effusion and right upper lung airway disease. The patient's white blood cell count has increased significantly, and the patient is being treated empirically for infection and leukostasis. The patient also has a history of C. difficile infection, and a rectal mass was biopsied at a previous hospital.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Leukostasis: The patient's profound leukocytosis increases the risk of leukostasis, which can lead to respiratory failure, cerebral edema, and other complications.
2. Infection: The patient's increased white blood cell count may be a sign of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and right-sided pulmonary infiltrate increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased morbidity.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection increases the risk of recurrence, which can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Leukemia Progression or Transformation: The patient's increasing white blood cell count may be a sign of leukemia progression or transformation, which can lead to worsening of symptoms and increased risk of complications.
6. Right-Sided Pulmonary Infiltrate: The patient's right-sided pulmonary infiltrate may be a sign of pneumonia or other inflammatory process, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
7. Nephrotic Syndrome: The patient's history of membranous nephropathy increases the risk of nephrotic syndrome, which can lead to edema, proteinuria, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
2. Treat the patient empirically for infection with broad-spectrum antibiotics and consider adding antifungal therapy if the patient's white blood cell count continues to rise.
3. Consider bronchoscopy and biopsy to evaluate the patient's right-sided pulmonary infiltrate and rule out pneumonia or other inflammatory process.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider leukapheresis if the patient's count continues to rise.
5. Consider adding hydroxyurea to the patient's treatment regimen to help reduce the patient's white blood cell count.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adjusting the patient's medications to minimize the risk of nephrotic syndrome.
7. Consider repeating the patient's D-dimer test to rule out pulmonary embolism."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly with decreased oxygen requirement, but the underlying cause of the hypoxia remains unclear. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for presumed bacterial pneumonia, but the chest CT scan suggests a multifocal infection or aspiration. A bronchoscopy has been ordered to determine the diagnosis. The patient's WBC count has decreased from 104K to 77K, but the possibility of leukostasis remains. The patient has also been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) and is being treated with oral flagyl. The patient's past medical history includes chronic kidney disease, membranous nephropathy, and a history of cyclophosphamide treatment for membranous nephropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Leukostasis: The patient's WBC count has decreased, but the possibility of leukostasis remains. If left untreated, leukostasis can lead to respiratory failure and death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan suggests a multifocal infection or aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia if left untreated.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff infection and is being treated with oral flagyl. If the infection is not adequately treated, it could lead to severe colitis and sepsis.
4. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, which could worsen if not managed properly.
5. Membranous nephropathy: The patient has a history of membranous nephropathy, which could lead to kidney failure if not managed properly.
6. Cyclophosphamide toxicity: The patient has a history of cyclophosphamide treatment for membranous nephropathy, which could lead to toxicity and other complications if not managed properly.
7. Leukemia transformation: The patient has a history of CMML, which could transform into a more aggressive form of leukemia if not managed properly.
8. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's WBC count has decreased, which could lead to tumor lysis syndrome if not managed properly.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved slightly, but the underlying cause of the hypoxia remains unclear. If left untreated, respiratory failure could occur.
10. Sepsis: The patient has a history of C. diff infection and has received antibiotics, which could lead to sepsis if not managed properly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.

   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]

   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CMML), is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has undergone a series of diagnostic tests, including a trans-thoracic echo, ultrasound, and chest CT scan, which suggest multifocal infection or aspiration as the likely cause of the patient's respiratory distress. The patient has received extended antibiotics, but remains significantly worse than baseline, raising concerns for an unusual pathogen such as fungal etiology or interstitial lung disease such as PAP.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 104K, which is trending down to 77K after treatment with hydroxyurea. The patient also has a history of C. difficile infection, which is being treated with PO flagyl.

The patient's medical history includes CMML, which was diagnosed in 2018 and has been managed conservatively with close monitoring. The patient has also had a history of membranous nephropathy, which has led to chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's multifocal infection or aspiration may progress, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Leukostasis: The patient's leukocytosis may cause leukostasis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or infarction.
4. Fungal infection: The patient's prolonged antibiotic treatment may increase the risk of fungal infection, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis.
5. Intestinal perforation: The patient's C. difficile infection may lead to intestinal perforation, which could require surgical intervention.
6. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or require dialysis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of chronic leukemia and chronic renal failure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.
   FEN: NPO for bronchoscopy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) who is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for an extended period, but his condition has not improved, and a bronchoscopy has been scheduled to determine the diagnosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 104.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 207 x 10^9/L.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest CT scan, show multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration. The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of CMML, which has been managed conservatively with close monitoring.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bacterial pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan shows multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration.
2. Fungal pneumonia: The patient's chest CT scan shows multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration.
3. Leukostasis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and leukostasis is a possibility.
4. Interstitial lung disease (ILD): The patient's chest CT scan shows multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration.
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's chest CT scan shows multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration, and a negative workup for PE.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest CT scan are consistent with ARDS.
7. Cytokine release syndrome: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin level may indicate a cytokine release syndrome.
8. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): The patient's elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin level may indicate a TLS.
9. Nephrotic syndrome: The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, and the patient's current laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin level and elevated creatinine level.
10. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreased, and the patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of CMML.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, the patient's potential medical complications are multifocal infection or aspiration, leukostasis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine release syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, and anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML, requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 5**]
   for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.
    1. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies include
   bacterial pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, leukostasis, ILD such as PAP, or
   PE in that order of likelihood.  Patient remains afebrile and is
   breathing more confortably with decreased oxygen requirement. Chest CT
   is most consistent with multifocal infection. However has received an
   extended course of antibiotics at the OSH continued here and remains
   significantly worse than baseline raising concern for an unusual
   pathogen such as fungal etiology, and also interstitial lung disease
   such as PAP. A bronchoscopy will be useful to determine the diagnosis.
   Leukostasis remains a possibility though his WBC is decreasing. PE is
   highly unlikely given a negative workup.
   -bronchoscopy today.
   -Check betaglucan and galactomannan
   - hydroxyurea per heme/onc
   - TLS labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - taper steroids (was being treated for presumed COPD exacerb at
   [**Hospital1 **])
   2. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on admission
   to [**Hospital3 902**] to 104K at time of transfer.  Now on hydroxyurea,
   trending down to 77 today. The possible causing included pulmonary
   infection, C diff,  steroid-effect, and transformation of leukemia.
   -appreciate oncology recommendations
   -continue hydroxyurea
   -Bone Marrow biopsy being read by in house pathology, f/u results
   -follow up flow cytometry
   - follow tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
    3. Rectal mass:  Found incidentally at OSH. Biopsied at OSH,
   preliminary path read concerning for SCC. CEA results within normal
   limits.
   -appreciate surgical consult recommendations
   -biopsy now in [**Hospital1 5**] pathology
   - f/u biopsy pathology
   -MRI pelvis, MRI liver
   -Endoscopic U/S
   4. C. diff confirmed while at outside hospital. On PO flagyl day [**3-3**]
   - Continue flagyl
    5. CMML:  Diagnosed in [**2178**] and managed conservatively with close
   monitoring.  Had not received chemotherapy for this.  Concern for
   possible AML transformation as above. On hydroxyurea. Management as
   above
   6.  Nephrotic syndrome:  Membranous nephropathy per past diagnosis.
   - renally dose meds
   7. Anemia. Hct drop from 37 to 30 on admission. No stable at 30. Most
   likely dilutional and possible contribution from suppression by
   hydroxyurea. No indication of bleed. Continue to follow.
   FEN: NPO for bronchoscopy.

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), was transferred to the ICU for further management of hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient's condition has not improved significantly since admission, with continued hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a trans-thoracic echo, LE ultrasound, and a chest CT scan, which revealed multifocal ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and septal thickening consistent with multifocal infection or aspiration.

The patient has received extended courses of antibiotics for possible bacterial pneumonia, but remains afebrile and breathing more comfortably with decreased oxygen requirement. The patient's WBC count has decreased from 104K to 77K, but leukostasis remains a possibility. The patient's rectal mass was biopsied and preliminary path read concerning for squamous cell carcinoma. The patient has also been diagnosed with C. difficile and has a history of nephrotic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's multifocal infection or aspiration may progress to sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Leukostasis: The patient's leukocytosis may worsen, leading to leukostasis, which could cause pulmonary and other organ dysfunction.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of nephrotic syndrome and CMML may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased tolerance to therapy.
6. Infection: The patient's multifocal infection or aspiration may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or septicemia.
7. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's CMML may undergo transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, leading to tumor lysis syndrome.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's rectal mass may bleed, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Renal failure: The patient's nephrotic syndrome may worsen, leading to renal failure.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CMML and nephrotic syndrome may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias."
