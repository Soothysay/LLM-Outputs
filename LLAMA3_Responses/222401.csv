   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o F CAD, CHF, HTN, sick sinus s/p pacer,
   severe AS who presents with acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Elevated WBC concerning for pneumonia,
   recieved ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in ED. Patchy infiltrates on CXR
   concerning for atypical pneumonia versus volume overload. BP > 200 on
   presentation suggesting patient could have acutely flashed secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Acute decompensation also concerning for MI
   (patient with known CAD disease and paced EKG makes acute changes
   difficult to intrepert on EKG). Less likely PE in setting of patchy
   infiltrates on CXR. For CHF exacerbation patient received 60 mg IV
   lasix however dropped pressure to 60 in the setting of propofo and
   patient's mod-severe AS makes her preload dependent and difficult to
   diuresis.
   - Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for CAP (no nursing home expsosure,
   prior MDR)
   - Send sputum culture and legionella antigen
   - Trend troponins
   - ECHO to eval progression of AS, systolic/diastolic dysfunction
   - Place a-line to monitor ABGs
   - Ultrasound CVP to eval respiratory variation and whether volume
   overloaded vs. hypovolemic -> CVP easily collapsable try 500 cc bolus
   # Hypotension: Patient with labile blood pressures ranging from hypo to
   hypertensive. Hypotensive most likely in setting of propofol, however
   lactate elevated 5.9 and acute kidney injury concerning for shock.
   - Stat lactate on arrival
   - Antibiotics as above for possible PNA leading to septic shock
   - Follow urine, blood for infection
   - ECHO and troponins to eval for cardiogenic shock
   - 500 cc bolus trial and attempt to decrease PEEP
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9. Concerning for
   shock, however adequate urine output.
   - Send urine lytes
   - 5OO cc bolus
   # CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease but no intervention. No
   history of chest pain, but difficult to interpert EKG in setting of
   v-pacing.
   - Trend troponins
   - Continue ASA, simvastatin
   # HTN: Labile blood pressure (see above).
   - Hold blood pressure medications (Lopressor, Clonidine) until follow
   for longer course
   - Place a-line for closer/more adequate monitoring
   # CHF: Acute respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation.
   - Hold Imdur in setting of labile blood pressure
   - Hold Lasix until able to assess volume status

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, and severe AS who presented with acute respiratory distress. She received antibiotics for possible pneumonia and has been placed on a ventilator. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.9°F, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/58 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, and oxygen delivery device set to 50%. Her lab results show elevated WBC, troponin-T levels, and lactate levels, indicating possible pneumonia, cardiogenic shock, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated WBC and patchy infiltrates on CXR suggest possible pneumonia. She is receiving antibiotics, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of the infection.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's troponin-T levels and lactate levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiogenic shock. Her labile blood pressure and decreased urine output also suggest possible shock.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute kidney injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of the injury.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is receiving levothyroxine. Her thyroid function should be monitored closely to ensure adequate replacement therapy.
5. Mod-Severe Aortic Stenosis: The patient's severe AS makes her preload dependent and difficult to diurese. Her increasing dyspnea prior to admission suggests possible acute exacerbation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the severity of her AS and the best course of treatment.
6. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure and decreased urine output suggest possible hypotension. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of the hypotension.
7. Septic Shock: The patient's elevated WBC and lactate levels suggest possible septic shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and severity of the shock.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely to determine the cause and severity of her cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury, and hypotension.
3. Continue thyroid replacement therapy and monitor the patient's thyroid function closely.
4. Evaluate the patient's mod-severe AS and determine the best course of treatment.
5. Consider placing a central venous catheter to monitor the patient's central venous pressure and determine if she is volume overloaded or hypovolemic.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels to determine if she is developing acute kidney injury or other electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan: 87 y/o F CAD, CHF, HTN, sick sinus s/p pacer,
   severe AS who presents with acute respiratory distress.
   # Acute respiratory distress: Elevated WBC concerning for pneumonia,
   recieved ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in ED. Patchy infiltrates on CXR
   concerning for atypical pneumonia versus volume overload. BP > 200 on
   presentation suggesting patient could have acutely flashed secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Acute decompensation also concerning for MI
   (patient with known CAD disease and paced EKG makes acute changes
   difficult to intrepert on EKG). Less likely PE in setting of patchy
   infiltrates on CXR. For CHF exacerbation patient received 60 mg IV
   lasix however dropped pressure to 60 in the setting of propofo and
   patient's mod-severe AS makes her preload dependent and difficult to
   diuresis.
   - diurese with 60 IV Lasix once more prior to extubation
   - Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for CAP (no nursing home expsosure,
   prior MDR)
   - Bronchial wash (respiratory) for sputum culture and legionella
   antigen
   - Trend troponins
   - ECHO to eval progression of AS, systolic/diastolic dysfunction
   - Place a-line to monitor ABGs
   - Ultrasound CVP to eval respiratory variation and whether volume
   overloaded vs. hypovolemic -> CVP easily collapsable try 500 cc bolus
   # Hypertension: increasingly hypertensive
   - low dose captopril (12.5 TID)
   - diuresis as above
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient with labile blood pressures ranging
   from hypo to hypertensive. Hypotensive most likely in setting of
   propofol, however lactate elevated 5.9 and acute kidney injury
   concerning for shock.
   - Antibiotics as above for possible PNA leading to septic shock
   - Follow urine, blood for infection
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9. Concerning for
   shock, however adequate urine output.
   - Send urine lytes
   - 5OO cc bolus
   # CAD: Patient with known 3 vessel disease but no intervention. No
   history of chest pain, but difficult to interpert EKG in setting of
   v-pacing.
   - Trend troponins
   - Continue ASA, simvastatin
   # HTN: Labile blood pressure (see above).
   - Hold blood pressure medications (Lopressor, Clonidine) until follow
   for longer course
   - Place a-line for closer/more adequate monitoring
   # CHF: Acute respiratory distress concerning for acute exacerbation.
   - Hold Imdur in setting of labile blood pressure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, and sick sinus syndrome with a pacemaker. She presents with acute respiratory distress, which is concerning for pneumonia, CHF exacerbation, and possible MI. She has received antibiotics and diuretics, and is being monitored closely. Her blood pressure is labile, and she is at risk for shock. Her creatinine has increased, and she is being monitored for acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated WBC count and patchy infiltrates on CXR suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's acute respiratory distress and elevated JVP suggest CHF exacerbation, which could lead to cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema.
3. MI: The patient's known CAD disease and paced EKG make it difficult to interpret acute changes on EKG, but the possibility of MI cannot be ruled out.
4. Shock: The patient's labile blood pressure, elevated lactate, and acute kidney injury suggest the possibility of shock, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism could lead to decreased cardiac output and worsening of her condition.
6. Aortic Stenosis: The patient's mod-severe aortic stenosis could lead to decreased cardiac output and worsening of her condition, particularly in the setting of CHF exacerbation.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress could lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation and increase her risk of complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and diuretics to manage the patient's pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and consider placing an arterial line to monitor ABGs.
3. Trend troponins to monitor for MI and consider performing an ECHO to evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine and consider performing a urinalysis to evaluate for kidney injury.
5. Consider performing an ultrasound CVP to evaluate respiratory variation and whether the patient is volume overloaded or hypovolemic.
6. Continue levothyroxine 50 mcg daily to manage the patient's hypothyroidism.
7. Continue ASA and simvastatin to manage the patient's CAD disease.
8. Consider performing a bronchial wash for sputum culture and legionella antigen to evaluate for possible pneumonia.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider repleting electrolytes as necessary.
10. Consider placing a central line to monitor the patient's central venous pressure and evaluate for signs of central venous catheter-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday evening (5:20 pm) Pt was extubated and procedure was
   tolerated well. Post extubation ABG 7.41/42/78/28 @ 3L
   Pt briefly on nitro gtt after become hypertensive to 200s systolic in
   peri-extubation period, but gtt was weaned off after approximately 1
   hour
   Pt now on 3L O2 which is what she is on at home
   wanted something for sleep -  as she was alert and conversational and
   respiratory fine, got 25mg trazadone.
   Lasix not given yesterday because of good urine output.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Respiratory Status:** The patient was successfully extubated, and their respiratory status has improved. However, they still appear volume overloaded on examination, which may require further diuresis.

**Hypertension:** The patient was hypertensive during the peri-extubation period, requiring nitro gtt. They are now normotensive, but labile blood pressure ranges from hypotensive to hypertensive. This may be due to the setting of propofol, lactate elevation, and acute kidney injury.

**Cardiovascular Status:** The patient has a history of 3-vessel disease and severe aortic stenosis. They were ruled out for myocardial infarction, but the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia. The patient has labile blood pressure, which may be related to their cardiovascular condition.

**Renal Status:** The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.2 from a baseline of 0.9. This may indicate acute kidney injury, which is concerning in the setting of hypotension and hypertension.

**Other Complications:** The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and their electrolyte levels should be monitored regularly. They are also at risk for flash pulmonary edema, which may require further diuresis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
2. Flash pulmonary edema
3. Hypertensive emergency
4. Hypotensive shock
5. Acute kidney injury
6. Pneumonia
7. Septic shock
8. Cardiac arrhythmias
9. Electrolyte imbalances
10. Hypothyroidism

**Plan:**

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix to manage volume overload.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Continue antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Continue to trend the patient's lactate level and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider restarting ativan for labile blood pressure.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Consider restarting prophylactic antibiotics for possible sepsis.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual receiving invasive ventilation and mechanical ventilation support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 116/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance, with a total fluid intake of 1,165 mL and a total fluid output of 2,352 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,187 mL. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored closely, with a mean arterial pressure of 68 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula oxygen delivery device, with a ventilator mode of CPAP/PSV, and a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is being closely monitored, with a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.0, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 132. The patient's creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, and the troponin-T level is <0.01. The patient's blood glucose level is 131 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the critical nature of their condition, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and their oxygen saturation is being closely monitored. Prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to respiratory failure and the need for tracheostomy.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and their blood cultures are pending. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is paced, and their cardiac enzymes are elevated. Cardiac arrhythmias can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and their fluid balance is positive. Renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Bloodstream infections: The patient's central line and arterial line are in place, and the risk of bloodstream infections is high.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's skin assessment is limited, and the risk of pressure ulcers is high due to their prolonged immobility.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula oxygen delivery device, and the risk of pneumonia is high.

The patient's care plan includes ongoing respiratory support, hemodynamic monitoring, and laboratory monitoring. The patient's family should be educated on the patient's condition and the potential complications that can arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, and mod-severe AS, who presents with acute respiratory distress. She was intubated and received antibiotics for possible pneumonia. She was extubated yesterday evening and is currently on 3L O2, which is what she uses at home. She was given trazadone for sleep and her vital signs are stable. Her lab results show elevated WBC and troponin levels, and her chest X-ray shows patchy infiltrates, which may be due to pneumonia or volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated WBC and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest that she may have pneumonia. This could lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CAD and mod-severe AS makes her susceptible to cardiac complications such as MI, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Her elevated troponin levels and abnormal EKG readings suggest that she may be experiencing cardiac complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, ranging from hypertensive to hypotensive. This could lead to complications such as cardiac failure, kidney damage, and stroke.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and abnormal urine output suggest that she may be experiencing acute kidney injury. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular instability.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and troponin levels, as well as her abnormal chest X-ray, suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis. This could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and abnormal chest X-ray suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure. This could lead to further complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and cardiac arrest.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of CAD, mod-severe AS, and abnormal EKG readings make her susceptible to cardiac arrest. This could lead to death if not promptly treated.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, lab results, and respiratory status, and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and severe aortic stenosis. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress and was successfully extubated. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she is still volume overloaded and has been treated with diuretics. She has also been experiencing labile blood pressures, ranging from hypotensive to hypertensive, and has been treated with medications such as captopril and lasix.

Potential medical complications:

1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of acute respiratory distress and labile blood pressures suggest that she may have experienced flash pulmonary edema, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and severe aortic stenosis puts her at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and acute kidney injury suggest that she may be at risk for further renal complications, such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress puts her at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's history of sepsis and pneumonia puts her at risk for further infectious complications, such as bacteremia, meningitis, and septic shock.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's history of diabetes and electrolyte imbalances puts her at risk for metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and labile blood pressures puts her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of stroke and transient ischemic attack puts her at risk for further neurological complications such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cognitive decline.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and it is essential to closely monitor her condition and provide appropriate treatment to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday evening (5:20 pm) Pt was extubated and procedure was
   tolerated well. Post extubation ABG 7.41/42/78/28 @ 3L
   Pt briefly on nitro gtt after become hypertensive to 200s systolic in
   peri-extubation period, but gtt was weaned off after approximately 1
   hour
   Pt now on 3L O2 which is what she is on at home
   wanted something for sleep -  as she was alert and conversational and
   respiratorily fine gave her 25mg trazadone.

Summary:

The patient is a 87-year-old female with a history of CAD, CHF, HTN, and severe AS who was admitted with acute respiratory distress. She was successfully extubated and is currently on 3L O2. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 116/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a mild respiratory distress with bibasilar crackles and a systolic murmur. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, and elevated lactate level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of acute respiratory distress and flash pulmonary edema are concerning, and she may require further treatment to manage her fluid overload.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she may require further management to control her hypertension.
3. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she may require further management to control her blood pressure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.2 from baseline 0.9, and she may require further monitoring and treatment to manage her acute kidney injury.
5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has been ruled out for myocardial infarction, but she may still be at risk for further cardiac complications.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of acute respiratory distress and flash pulmonary edema may be related to pneumonia, and she may require further treatment to manage her infection.
7. Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms of acute respiratory distress and flash pulmonary edema may be related to septic shock, and she may require further treatment to manage her infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with Lasix to manage the patient's fluid overload.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication as necessary to control her hypertension.
3. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust her treatment as necessary to manage her acute kidney injury.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her treatment as necessary to manage her cardiac complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her treatment as necessary to manage her respiratory complications.
6. Consider further treatment for the patient's suspected pneumonia, such as antibiotics and further diagnostic testing.
7. Consider further treatment for the patient's suspected septic shock, such as antibiotics and further diagnostic testing."
