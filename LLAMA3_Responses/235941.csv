   single access with mild hypotension induced by sedation, currently
   responding to fluids
   - on fentanyl/midazolam boluses, instead of propofol
   - likely extubation tomorrow
   - pt. s/p head CT for anisocoria--> no acute findings
   - will need to f/u with oncology since it looks like his myeloma has
   returned, given his renal failure, electrolyte disturbances and

   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.
   - continued good oxygenation, patient weaned to PS overnight, with
   RSBI=64
   - hopeful extubation this morning
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc; pan-culture; follow micro closely
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria which is not documented in prior notes, most likely
   physiologic. However, in setting of AMS, difficult to rule out CVA.
   Infection vs hyperviscosity vs debility in setting of metabolic demand
   in an elderly patient, vs medications vs. possible parkinsons.
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow evals
   - treating C. diff; UTI was treated; re-send cultures in setting of
   decompensation
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   Flagyl and PO vanc started.
   -          continue
   -          pan-cx for potential other sources of infection in addition
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
   Getting 20 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Patient with multiple
   markers of myeloma progression.
   - Getting tumor lysis labs given hyperphosphatemia
   - continuing dex
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; w/e onc fellow is
   emailing to try to get his involvement as early as possible; check in
   with onc team, make sure they follow while in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L o/n
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   -          f/u w primary oncologist
   -          appreciate renal f/u and recommendations
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   RVR briefly on arrival. Now in sinus.
   -          continue dilt
   -          monitor on telemetry

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   markers of myeloma progression.
   - Getting tumor lysis labs given hyperphosphatemia
   - continuing dex
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; w/e onc fellow is
   emailing to try to get his involvement as early as possible; check in
   with onc team, make sure they follow while in [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L o/n
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple myeloma, respiratory and cardiac arrest, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at 500 mL tidal volume, and 12 cmH2O peak inspiratory pressure. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and ABG results show pH 7.36, PaO2 543, and PaCO2 25.
2. Cardiovascular Status: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 80 bpm and blood pressure of 123/60 mmHg.
3. Neurological Status: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8, with rigidity and tremors in the upper extremities. The patient does not follow simple commands and has non-purposeful movements.
4. Renal Status: The patient has renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 40 mg/dL.
5. Laboratory Results: The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 7.7 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 162 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with sodium of 137 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, and magnesium of 1.8 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory acidosis.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac status is also critical, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's renal failure is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, acute kidney injury, and end-stage renal disease.
5. Infection Complications: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is at risk of developing further infections, including sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Hyperphosphatemia Complications: The patient's hyperphosphatemia is critical, and there is a risk of further elevation, hypercalcemia, and renal failure.
7. Anemia Complications: The patient's anemia is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, transfusion-related complications, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's metabolic status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.  Additionally large volume of
   secretions in the back of his throat and large mucus plug post
   intubation suction leads to a mucus plug being the most likely etiology
   - continued good oxygenation, patient weaned to PS overnight, with
   RSBI=64
   - extubated this morning
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc-though unlikely related to AMS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria which is not documented in prior notes, most likely
   physiologic. However, in setting of AMS, difficult to rule out CVA.
   Infection vs hyperviscosity vs debility in setting of metabolic demand
   in an elderly patient, vs medications vs. possible parkinsons.
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow [**Last Name (LF) 10493**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off
   on feeds for now
   - treating C. diff; UTI was treated; re-send cultures in setting of
   decompensation
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   -Continue Flagyl and PO vanc
   -pan-cx for potential other sources of infection in addition
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
   Getting 20 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Patient with multiple
   markers of myeloma progression.
   - continuing dex
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; will try to set up a
   family meeting early the week to discuss further goals of care and
   overall prognosis with MM as per family
s request
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L o/n, will transfuse 1unit PRBC
s since
   his HCT had been dropping prior to transfer
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   - will start allopurinol given increased uric acid and IVF with bicarb
   to alkalinize his urine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.  Additionally large volume of
   secretions in the back of his throat and large mucus plug post
   intubation suction leads to a mucus plug being the most likely etiology
   - continued good oxygenation, patient weaned to PS overnight, with
   RSBI=64
   - extubated this morning
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc-though unlikely related to AMS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria which is not documented in prior notes, most likely
   physiologic. However, in setting of AMS, difficult to rule out CVA.
   Infection vs hyperviscosity vs debility in setting of metabolic demand
   in an elderly patient, vs medications vs. possible parkinsons.
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow [**Last Name (LF) 10493**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off
   on feeds for now
   - treating C. diff; UTI was treated; re-send cultures in setting of
   decompensation
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   -Continue Flagyl and PO vanc
   -pan-cx for potential other sources of infection in addition
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
   Getting 20 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Patient with multiple
   markers of myeloma progression.
   - continuing dex
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; will try to set up a
   family meeting early the week to discuss further goals of care and
   overall prognosis with MM as per family
s request
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L o/n, will transfuse 1unit PRBC
s since
   his HCT had been dropping prior to transfer
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   - will start allopurinol given increased uric acid and IVF with bicarb
   to alkalinize his urine
   -          f/u w primary oncologist
   -          appreciate renal f/u and recommendations
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   RVR briefly on arrival. Now in sinus.
   -          continue dilt
   -          monitor on telemetry

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* The patient experienced a respiratory/cardiac arrest on the floor, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU.
* The patient is currently sedated and responding to fluids, with a plan for extubation tomorrow.
* The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, which has returned, and is experiencing renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, and increased kappa:lambda ratio.
* The patient has an altered mental status, with initial concerns for infection causing the condition. Neurology input suggests no clear cause, and the patient is being treated with carbidopa-levidopa.
* The patient has a C. difficile infection, which is being treated with flagyl and PO vanc.
* The patient has anemia, which is likely related to multiple myeloma, and is being treated with IV fluids and blood transfusions.
* The patient has hyperphosphatemia, which is likely related to multiple myeloma and tumor lysis.
* The patient has renal failure, which is likely related to multiple myeloma, and is being treated with allopurinol and IV fluids with bicarbonate.
* The patient has atrial fibrillation, which has resolved to sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Further diminished mental status with difficulty controlling secretions
* Respiratory complications due to C. difficile infection and altered mental status
* Renal failure progression and electrolyte imbalances
* Anemia worsening and potential need for blood transfusions
* Hyperphosphatemia exacerbating renal failure
* Increased risk of sepsis and infection due to immunocompromise from multiple myeloma
* Potential for CVA or other neurological complications due to altered mental status and anisocoria

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with history of multiple myeloma and with altered mental
   status complicating current hospitalization.  He was transferred to
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] ICU with PEA arrest with rapid return to spontaneous circulation
   with CPR alone and 2 minute event time.  He has had rapid move to
   extubation and did not have persistent hypotension but has maintained
   altered mental status across time.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   -Patient extubated without event in the setting of favorable
   oxygenation and limited impairment in ventilation
   -Good tolerance of extubation with maintenance of stable saturations
   and ventilation
   2)Altered Mental Status-Definative and single source not clearly seen
   despite extensive investigations.
   -Sinemet treatment in place
   -Thiamine
   -He does have altered pupil reflex
   -Will have to follow up on CT scan
   -Need neurology to evaluate patient and consider further interventions
   and imaging
   3)MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)--Clear worsening by
   parameters (Kappa/Lambda increased,  Increased Ca++) and concern for
   limited therapeutic options raised.
   -Dexamethasone to be completed today
   -Will need to discuss future treatment plan and prognosis with primary
   oncology team and family to guide therapeutic choices going forward.
   -Will transfuse PRBC today
   4)PEA Arrest-Trigger for this does appear to be most likely a
   respiratory source and perhaps triggered by hypoxia with bradycardia
   and progression to PEA arrest as the reversal was quite rapid with
   airway obstruction with secretions quite prominent following
   intubation.  CXR, eletrolytes all reassuring even immediately after
   event.
   -Will need to establish adequate plan for maintenance of patent airway
   -Will take humidified air to keep secretions movable
   -Will suction PRN
   -Will maintain npo
   5)C. Diff Infection-
   -Flagyl to continue
   6)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Persistent
   -Likely related to Myeloma for chronic insult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo male with history of multiple myeloma and with altered mental
   status complicating current hospitalization.  He was transferred to
   [**Hospital Ward Name 57**] ICU with PEA arrest with rapid return to spontaneous circulation
   with CPR alone and 2 minute event time.  He has had rapid move to
   extubation and did not have persistent hypotension but has maintained
   altered mental status across time.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   -Patient extubated without event in the setting of favorable
   oxygenation and limited impairment in ventilation
   -Good tolerance of extubation with maintenance of stable saturations
   and ventilation
   2)Altered Mental Status-Definative and single source not clearly seen
   despite extensive investigations.
   -Sinemet treatment in place
   -Thiamine
   -He does have altered pupil reflex
   -Will have to follow up on CT scan
   -Need neurology to evaluate patient and consider further interventions
   and imaging
   3)MULTIPLE MYELOMA  (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)--Clear worsening by
   parameters (Kappa/Lambda increased,  Increased Ca++) and concern for
   limited therapeutic options raised.
   -Dexamethasone to be completed today
   -Will need to discuss future treatment plan and prognosis with primary
   oncology team and family to guide therapeutic choices going forward.
   -Will transfuse PRBC today
   4)PEA Arrest-Trigger for this does appear to be most likely a
   respiratory source and perhaps triggered by hypoxia with bradycardia
   and progression to PEA arrest as the reversal was quite rapid with
   airway obstruction with secretions quite prominent following
   intubation.  CXR, eletrolytes all reassuring even immediately after
   event.
   -Will need to establish adequate plan for maintenance of patent airway
   -Will take humidified air to keep secretions movable
   -Will suction PRN
   -Will maintain npo
   5)C. Diff Infection-
   -Flagyl to continue
   6)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Persistent
   -Likely related to Myeloma for chronic insult

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, respiratory failure, and C. diff infection. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a PEA arrest, which was reversed with CPR alone. He was extubated without event and is currently receiving oxygen therapy. His mental status remains altered, and he is not following commands. He has a high risk of aspiration and airway occlusion due to his altered mental status and respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.7-11.4
* Hct: 26.9-27.4
* Plt: 162-79
* Cr: 2.2-2.7
* TropT: 0.03-0.01
* TCO2: 15
* Glucose: 126-219
* Lactic Acid: 2.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* LDH: 1093 IU/L

      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
         MOLD.    RARE GROWTH.
   Imaging:
   CT Head ([**9-20**]): No acute intracranial process
   Chest X-ray ([**9-20**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions are new and left
   lower lobe atelectasis is worsened, pulmonary vasculature is engorged
   but there is probably not pulmonary edema. Heart size normal.
   Mediastinum not widened. ET tube and right subclavian infusion port are
   in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into a severely
   distended stomach and out of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.  Additionally large volume of
   secretions in the back of his throat and large mucus plug post
   intubation suction leads to a mucus plug being the most likely etiology
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc-though unlikely related to AMS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria, which is resolving, per neuro as long as his pupils remain
   reactive no further scans needed.  Infection vs hyperviscosity vs
   debility in setting of metabolic demand in an elderly patient, vs
   medications vs. parkinsons progression
   - per primary team neuro diagnosed him with Parkinson
s, will contine
   carbidopa-levidopa
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow evals, but will c/s
   nutrition for dobhoff feeds
   - treating C. diff; new cultures all negative
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
    Patient with multiple markers of myeloma progression.
   - completed 4 days of dexamethasone
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; will try to set up a
   family meeting early the week to discuss further goals of care and
   overall prognosis with MM as per family
s request
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L over the weekend, will transfuse 1unit
   PRBC
s since his HCT had been dropping prior to transfer
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   Concern by the primary team for possible HIT since his platelets have
   dropped from 253 now down to 36 today, which makes HIT less likely.
   Also concern that since his multiple myeloma has been progressing that
   his bone marrow is infiltrated with malignancy and unable to produce
   platelets appropriately.
   - Most likely related to multiple myeloma, no current signs of bleeding
   so no platelet transfusions at this time
   - HIT negative
   - will hold SQ heparin b/c his platelet count is so low
   - if patient will need any procedures then he will need platelet
   transfusions
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   -Continue IV Flagyl and add po vanc
   -Will recheck lactate and if it has become elevated will get a repeat
   CT scan
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   - will start allopurinol given increased uric acid and IVF with bicarb
   to alkalinize his urine
   - appreciate renal f/u and recommendations
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   RVR briefly on arrival. Now in sinus.
   -          continue dilt
   -          monitor on telemetry

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

      <10 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS.
      QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED.
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
         MOLD.    RARE GROWTH.
   Imaging:
   CT Head ([**9-20**]): No acute intracranial process
   Chest X-ray ([**9-20**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions are new and left
   lower lobe atelectasis is worsened, pulmonary vasculature is engorged
   but there is probably not pulmonary edema. Heart size normal.
   Mediastinum not widened. ET tube and right subclavian infusion port are
   in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into a severely
   distended stomach and out of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.  Additionally large volume of
   secretions in the back of his throat and large mucus plug post
   intubation suction leads to a mucus plug being the most likely etiology
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc-though unlikely related to AMS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria, which is resolving, per neuro as long as his pupils remain
   reactive no further scans needed.  Infection vs hyperviscosity vs
   debility in setting of metabolic demand in an elderly patient, vs
   medications vs. parkinsons progression
   - per primary team neuro diagnosed him with Parkinson
s, will contine
   carbidopa-levidopa
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow evals, but will c/s
   nutrition for dobhoff feeds
   - treating C. diff; new cultures all negative
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
    Patient with multiple markers of myeloma progression.
   - completed 4 days of dexamethasone
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; will try to set up a
   family meeting early the week to discuss further goals of care and
   overall prognosis with MM as per family
s request
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L over the weekend, will transfuse 1unit
   PRBC
s since his HCT had been dropping prior to transfer
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   Concern by the primary team for possible HIT since his platelets have
   dropped from 253 now down to 36 today, which makes HIT less likely.
   Also concern that since his multiple myeloma has been progressing that
   his bone marrow is infiltrated with malignancy and unable to produce
   platelets appropriately.
   - Most likely related to multiple myeloma, no current signs of bleeding
   so no platelet transfusions at this time
   - HIT negative
   - will hold SQ heparin b/c his platelet count is so low
   - if patient will need any procedures then he will need platelet
   transfusions
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   -Continue IV Flagyl and add po vanc
   -Will recheck lactate and if it has become elevated will get a repeat
   CT scan
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   - will start allopurinol given increased uric acid and IVF with bicarb
   to alkalinize his urine
   - appreciate renal f/u and recommendations
   ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   RVR briefly on arrival. Now in sinus.
   -          continue dilt
   -          monitor on telemetry

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, and altered mental status. He had a prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest and was intubated, with a recent extubation. 

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 79 bpm (68-90 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 139/68 mmHg (86/47-156/88 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (12-25 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hyperphosphatemia: likely due to tumor lysis or hypergammaglobulinemia, and may be related to multiple myeloma.
2. Renal failure: likely related to multiple myeloma, and being closely monitored.
3. Thrombocytopenia: likely related to multiple myeloma, and being managed with platelet transfusions as needed.
4. C. difficile infection: being treated with IV Flagyl and oral vancomycin.
5. Altered mental status: likely due to multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, or medications, and being managed with carbidopa-levodopa.
6. Hypercalcemia: not as marked, but may be related to multiple myeloma.
7. Respiratory failure: being managed with mechanical ventilation and suctioning.
8. Cardiovascular instability: being managed with diltiazem and monitoring on telemetry.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.5-11.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.6-10.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 146-36 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.2-2.7 mg/dL
* Urea: 222-114 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: abnormal potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels
* Blood glucose: 137-222 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: small bilateral pleural effusions, left lower lobe atelectasis, and engorged pulmonary vasculature.
* Head CT: no acute intracranial process.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing carbidopa-levodopa for Parkinson's disease
* Treating C. difficile infection with IV Flagyl and oral vancomycin
* Managing hyperphosphatemia with allopurinol and IV fluids with bicarbonate
* Monitoring renal function and adjusting treatment as needed
* Managing thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions as needed
* Continuing mechanical ventilation and suctioning for respiratory failure
* Monitoring cardiovascular stability with diltiazem and telemetry monitoring.

Overall, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management."

      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
         MOLD.    RARE GROWTH.
   Imaging:
   CT Head ([**9-20**]): No acute intracranial process
   Chest X-ray ([**9-20**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions are new and left
   lower lobe atelectasis is worsened, pulmonary vasculature is engorged
   but there is probably not pulmonary edema. Heart size normal.
   Mediastinum not widened. ET tube and right subclavian infusion port are
   in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into a severely
   distended stomach and out of view.
   Assessment and Plan
   S/P PEA ARREST
   PEA arrest likely precipitated by pulmonary arrest given rapidity with
   which normal heart function returned, no epinephrine. [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-20**]
   secretions and mucus plugging, compromised airway in setting of
   decreased sensorium and altered mental status. Good oxygenation on
   arrival suggests this was not a primary pulmonary event; consistent
   with mucus plug/airway occlusion.  Additionally large volume of
   secretions in the back of his throat and large mucus plug post
   intubation suction leads to a mucus plug being the most likely etiology
   - continued good oxygenation, patient weaned to PS overnight, with
   RSBI=64
   - extubated this morning
   - continue good suction
   - concern for further diminished mental status with difficulty
   controlling his secretions
   - treat C diff w flagyl/po vanc-though unlikely related to AMS
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   Has had consultation and follow-up from neuro, with head imaging.
   Initial concern for infection causing his AMS, had a UTI on admission,
   however MS did not improve with treatment.  Neurology input with no
   clear cause, started on carbidopa-levidopa given his rigidity and
   tremor, which per neuro is not typical of essential tremor.  Had an LP
   that was negative for infection.  EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   but no signs of seizure.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] was found to have
   anisocoria which is not documented in prior notes, most likely
   physiologic. However, in setting of AMS, difficult to rule out CVA.
   Infection vs hyperviscosity vs debility in setting of metabolic demand
   in an elderly patient, vs medications vs. possible parkinsons.
   - patient has continued to fail speech/swallow [**Last Name (LF) 10493**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will hold off
   on feeds for now
   - treating C. diff; UTI was treated; re-send cultures in setting of
   decompensation
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA
   Getting 20 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 days. Patient with multiple
   markers of myeloma progression.
   - continuing dex
   - Primary oncologist not currently available; will try to set up a
   family meeting early the week to discuss further goals of care and
   overall prognosis with MM as per family
s request
   - Anemia likely related to MM, and acute drop overnight from IV fluid
   administration, pt. received 5L o/n, will transfuse 1unit PRBC
s since
   his HCT had been dropping prior to transfer
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA
   Concern by the primary team for possible HIT since his platelets have
   dropped from 253 now down to 36 today.  Currently holding all heparin
   products, HIT labs are not pending in OMR so will resend today.  Also
   concern that since his multiple myeloma has been progressing that his
   bone marrow may be infiltrated with malignancy and unable to produce
   platelets appropriately.
   - will resend HIT labs
   - continue to hold all heparin
   - if patient will need any procedures then he will need platelet
   transfusions
   C. DIFFICILE INFECTION
   -Continue Flagyl
   -pan-cx for potential other sources of infection in addition
   HYPERPHOSPHATEMIA
   [**Month (only) 51**] be a product of tumor lysis; additionally, spurious
   hyperphosphatemia can be result of hypergammaglobulinemia. Either way
   this is likely the product of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia not as
   marked. Less likely to be related to renal failure since patient is
   currently not eating and phos would only rise in renal failure with
   continued ingestion.
   -renal continues to follow
   RENAL FAILURE
   Likely product of multiple myeloma. Follow closely over next 24 hours
   given period of hypoperfusion; however, decrease of gammaglobulin
   production is likely only measure that is likely to help.
   - will start allopurinol given increased uric acid and IVF with bicarb

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, and recent pulmonary arrest. He has been experiencing altered mental status, rigidity, and tremors, which are being managed with carbidopa-levodopa. The patient has been extubated and is receiving humidified oxygen and frequent suctioning to manage his respiratory secretions.

The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and is being treated with Flagyl. He has also been experiencing thrombocytopenia, which is being managed by holding all heparin products and re-sending HIT labs. The patient has a history of anemia, which is likely related to his multiple myeloma.

The patient has been experiencing hyperphosphatemia, which is likely related to his multiple myeloma. He has also been experiencing hypercalcemia, which is less likely to be related to renal failure given his current diet. The patient is at risk for renal failure, which is being closely monitored.

The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm. He is being managed with diltiazem and is being monitored on telemetry.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.5-11.4 K/uL
* Hct: 26.0-27.4%
* Plt: 146-79 K/uL
* Cr: 2.2-2.7 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02-0.01 ng/mL
* TCO2: 15 mmol/L
* Glucose: 137-222 mg/dL
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* CT Head: No acute intracranial process
* Chest X-ray: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left lower lobe atelectasis, and engorged pulmonary vasculature

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further decline in mental status due to C. difficile infection, hyperphosphatemia, or hypercalcemia
* Development of renal failure or worsening of existing renal failure
* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to C. difficile or other sources
* Cardiovascular complications due to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac conditions
* Respiratory complications due to mucus plugging or other respiratory issues

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuing treatment for C. difficile infection with Flagyl
* Managing thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions as needed
* Monitoring and managing hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia
* Closely monitoring renal function and managing renal failure if it develops
* Continuing atrial fibrillation management with diltiazem and telemetry monitoring
* Managing respiratory secretions with humidified oxygen and frequent suctioning
* Transfusing 1 unit of PRBCs due to anemia
* Re-sending HIT labs to monitor for HIT
* Holding all heparin products until further notice"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with cardiac arrest, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, multiple myeloma, renal failure, anemia, acidosis, and C. diff. The patient has been extubated and is stable with regard to oxygenation. The patient's mental status has improved, and they are able to speak in their native language. The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a normal heart rhythm and blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 100%. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL. The patient has a history of multiple myeloma and has been treated with chemotherapy. The patient's platelet count is low, and they are at risk for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they are at risk for further deterioration due to their underlying respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and they are at risk for further deterioration due to their underlying renal failure.
3. Multiple myeloma: The patient has a history of multiple myeloma, and they are at risk for further complications, such as bone marrow failure and infection.
4. C. diff: The patient has a diagnosis of C. diff, and they are at risk for further complications, such as sepsis and death.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and they are at risk for bleeding.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to further complications, such as infection and wound dehiscence.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to further complications, such as stroke and heart failure.
9. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and they are at risk for further cardiac complications.
10. HIT antibody: The patient has a pending HIT antibody test, which can lead to further complications, such as bleeding and thrombocytopenia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide supportive care as needed.
3. Continue to treat the patient's multiple myeloma with chemotherapy and other medications as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's C. diff with antibiotics and other medications as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and provide transfusions as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium level and provide supportive care as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and provide supportive care as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and provide supportive care as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide supportive care as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's HIT antibody status and provide supportive care as needed."
