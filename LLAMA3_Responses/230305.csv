You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male who presented with cardiogenic shock due to biliary obstruction, which was later found to be caused by an anastomotic stricture. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting. He was placed on a balloon pump and weaned off levophed, with dopamine being increased to 7.5 mcg/kg/hr. He is sedated and unarousable, with a BCx and Urine Cx obtained.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a MAP of 87/64 mmHg, HR of 86 bpm, and SpO2 of 97%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 14 mmHg, PAP of (50/31) mmHg, and CO/CI of (5.8/3.3) L/min/m2. His laboratory results show a WBC count of 22.4, Hct of 27.9, and Plt count of 257 K/uL.

The patient's condition is being managed with a balloon pump, dopamine, and mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis, and his LFTs are trending down. He is at risk for anemia, leukocytosis, and respiratory failure, and will require close monitoring and potential transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: continued cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac tamponade.
2. Respiratory complications: respiratory failure, pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Infectious complications: sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
4. Hematological complications: anemia, leukocytosis, and bleeding.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
6. Neurological complications: seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
7. Renal complications: acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued management of his cardiogenic shock, sepsis work-up, and close monitoring of his laboratory results. He will require ongoing medical therapy and potential surgical interventions to address his underlying conditions."

   CXR -
   There is again seen diffuse
   airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which have improved
   slightly
   since the previous study. There is no large pleural effusions. A new
   intra-
   aortic balloon pump is identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as
   CO improves.
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.
   - Would  transfuse w/ goal of HCT >=30 given ischemia.
   .
   # S/P TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   -          Continue cellcept and prograf
   -          F/u tacro level.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CXR -
   There is again seen diffuse
   airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which have improved
   slightly
   since the previous study. There is no large pleural effusions. A new
   intra-
   aortic balloon pump is identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.

   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as
   CO improves.
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis C, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and biliary obstruction, is currently in cardiogenic shock and septic shock. He has undergone emergency room coronary angiography (ERCA) and has been treated with balloon pump and dopamine. His cardiac contractility is impaired due to myocardial stunning and MI.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 87/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring:
	+ Central venous pressure (CVP): 14 mmHg
	+ Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 50/31 mmHg
	+ Cardiac output (CO): 5.8 L/min
	+ Systemic vascular resistance (SVR): 700-800 dynes/s/cm^5
	+ Cardiac index (CI): 3.3 L/min/m^2

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 22.4-22.6 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 27.9-41%
* Platelet count (Plt): 1882-108 x 10^9/L
* Troponin-T: 3.13-5.39 ng/mL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3-1.2 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 1228 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, which have improved slightly since the previous study.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing balloon pump therapy
* Weaning dopamine to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of <65 mmHg
* Holding antihypertensives
* Starting furosemide to achieve a urine output of 100-150 cc
* Obtaining serial measurements of SVR, CI, and CO to reassess cardiac function and wean off IABP
* Continuing sepsis work-up and treatment for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and intra-abdominal infection
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary
* Trending daily liver function tests (LFTs) and considering surgery for biliary obstruction
* Transfusing blood products to maintain a hemoglobin level of ≥30 g/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: continued impairment of cardiac contractility, development of heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: worsening of ARDS, development of pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: worsening of acute kidney injury (AKI), development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infectious complications: development of sepsis, pneumonia, or intra-abdominal infection, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
5. Bleeding complications: bleeding from the surgical site, GI tract, or other sites, which can lead to hypovolemic shock.
6. Neurological complications: development of seizures, stroke, or other neurological deficits due to hypoxia, hypoperfusion, or sepsis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent these potential complications and improve outcomes."

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardigenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.  Fluconazole started per
   transplant surgery.  Patient getting an abdominal US to evaluate for
   fluid collection which showed (via prelim read) no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardigenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.  Fluconazole started per
   transplant surgery.  Patient getting an abdominal US to evaluate for
   fluid collection which showed (via prelim read) no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn

   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to biliary obstruction, cardiac shock, and septic shock. He has undergone ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy and has been diagnosed with 3-vessel disease (3VD) with stenting to the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary arteries (RCA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: In shock, likely multifactorial due to cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and septic (SVR in 700-800 range) causes. He is off levophed and on increased dose of dopamine. He has a cardiac contractility impairment likely due to myocardial stunning and MI.
* Respiratory: Likely ARDS, multifocal PNA, or aspiration pneumonitis.
* Renal: Acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to shock/pre-renal state.
* Anemia: HCT 27 was 41 on admission, decreased significantly post-OR on [**1-5**], currently stable, likely due to dilution and OR losses.
* Infectious: Septic shock, likely due to intra-abdominal, pulmonary, or urinary sources. He has a distended and tympanitic abdomen, no fluid collection on CT, and a negative urine analysis.
* Surgical: Biliary obstruction anastomotic stricture, likely due to recent surgical intervention.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac:
	+ Cardiac arrest
	+ Heart failure
	+ Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory:
	+ Respiratory failure
	+ Pneumonia
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Renal:
	+ Dialysis dependence
	+ Chronic kidney disease
* Infectious:
	+ Sepsis
	+ Organ failure
	+ Opportunistic infections
* Surgical:
	+ Anastomotic leak
	+ Bile duct injury
	+ Abscess formation

The patient requires continued treatment for septic shock, cardiac shock, and respiratory failure, as well as close monitoring of his cardiac function, renal function, and anemia. He also requires continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring for potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as
   CO improves.
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.
   - Would  transfuse w/ goal of HCT >=30 given ischemia.
   .
   # S/P TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   -          Continue cellcept and prograf

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and his lasix gtt was
   increased to 15 mg/hr.  His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.
   Fluconazole started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an abdominal
   US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension so his balloon
   was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who underwent liver transplant (OLT) and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to biliary obstruction, cardiogenic shock, and suspected septic shock. He has undergone ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy. The patient's condition is complex and multifactorial, with potential sources of infection including intra-abdominal, pulmonary, and urinary.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to 3-vessel disease (3VD) and anterior hypo/akinesis
	* Myocardial stunning and infarction (MI)
	* Impaired cardiac contractility
	* Possible need for continued balloon pump and dopamine support
2. Septic Complications:
	* Septic shock due to suspected infection sources (intra-abdominal, pulmonary, and urinary)
	* Possible need for continued empiric treatment with vancomycin and zosyn
	* Risk of line infection and need for consideration of pulling the right internal jugular (RIJ) line
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or multifocal Pneumonia (PNA) or aspiration pneumonitis
	* Need for continued mechanical ventilation and weaning of oxygen saturation
4. Biliary Complications:
	* Anastomotic stricture and biliary obstruction
	* Possible need for surgical intervention
5. Renal Complications:
	* Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) or pre-renal failure
	* Need for close monitoring of creatinine levels and potential need for diuresis
6. Anemia:
	* Significant drop in hemoglobin level post-operatively
	* Need for transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin level >= 30
7. Opportunistic Infections:
	* Risk of opportunistic infections due to immunosuppression and need for consideration of prophylactic antibiotics
8. Other Complications:
	* Possible need for continued stress ulcer prophylaxis and pain management
	* Need for close monitoring of glycemic control and nutrition

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to address the various potential complications and optimize his outcomes."

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), and Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT). He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to cardiogenic shock and septic shock.

The patient's cardiac status is critical, with a severely depressed ejection fraction and severe anterior hypo/akinesis on echocardiogram. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and has been placed on an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) and dopamine. His cardiac contractility is impaired, likely due to myocardial stunning and MI.

The patient's respiratory status is also critical, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible aspiration pneumonitis. He is mechanically ventilated and is receiving empiric treatment for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient's renal function is compromised, with an increasing creatinine level, likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and the use of the IABP.

The patient's anemia is also a concern, with a hemoglobin level of 23.1 g/dL. He has undergone blood draws and has oozing from his right groin, which may be contributing to his anemia. A decision was made to hold off on transfusions until his hemoglobin level stabilizes.

The patient's biliary obstruction is anastomotic stricture, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly trending downward. He is receiving empiric treatment for possible intra-abdominal infection.

The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with an elevated potassium level and a decreased calcium level.

The patient's medical team is monitoring his condition closely and is considering further workup and treatment for his ARF, anemia, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: continued cardiac contractility impairment, further cardiac damage, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: further deterioration of his respiratory status, possible need for intubation, and development of respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: further decline in renal function, possible need for dialysis, and development of chronic kidney disease.
4. Anemia complications: further decline in hemoglobin level, possible need for transfusions, and development of anemia-related complications.
5. Biliary complications: further worsening of his biliary obstruction, possible need for surgical intervention, and development of biliary-related complications.
6. Infection complications: development of sepsis, possible need for antibiotics, and development of multi-organ failure.

The patient's care plan includes continued monitoring of his cardiac, respiratory, and renal status, as well as management of his anemia, biliary obstruction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's medical team will continue to reassess his condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   The
   patient continues on dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some
   decrease in afterload and mild increase in DBP.  As the patient
s CI
   continues to be normal, this is less likely cardiogenic shock and more
   likely septic shock (SVR is low in the 800
s).  Cardiac contractility
   impaired likely due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury.
   - Will work to wean the balloon pump off and remove it today.
   - Continue dopamine gtt with goal of MAP >60, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection as well as fluconazole
   given his immunocompromised status.
   - Will obtain a TTE to evaluate for interval change of his cardiac
   function.
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient was afebrile yesterday, but
   given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly
   improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging from
   intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  CXR this am looked improved
   after diuresis for a net negative 1 L yesterday.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Line infection also a possibility.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - Sputum smear and Cx.
   - After the patient is weaned off the balloon pump and the heparin gtt
   is stopped, will pull his swan and arterial lines as these are possible
   sources of infection.  Will leave the RIJ for now, but can consider
   placing a new central line t/m and pulling that if he remains
   hypotensive.
   - Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   - F/u pending vanc level
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   - Will obtain another TTE to evaluate for interval change in his
   cardiac function.
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   - Will restart the lasix gtt with a goal of keeping him even today as
   his CXR looks slightly drier.  Will increase the gtt when giving the 2
   units of PRBC as below.
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   The
   patient continues on dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some
   decrease in afterload and mild increase in DBP.  As the patient
s CI
   continues to be normal, this is less likely cardiogenic shock and more
   likely septic shock (SVR is low in the 800
s).  Cardiac contractility
   impaired likely due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury.
   - Will work to wean the balloon pump off and remove it today.
   - Continue dopamine gtt with goal of MAP >60, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection as well as fluconazole
   given his immunocompromised status.
   - Will obtain a TTE to evaluate for interval change of his cardiac
   function.
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient was afebrile yesterday, but
   given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly
   improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging from
   intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  CXR this am looked improved
   after diuresis for a net negative 1 L yesterday.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Line infection also a possibility.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - Sputum smear and Cx.
   - After the patient is weaned off the balloon pump and the heparin gtt
   is stopped, will pull his swan and arterial lines as these are possible
   sources of infection.  Will leave the RIJ for now, but can consider
   placing a new central line t/m and pulling that if he remains
   hypotensive.
   - Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   - F/u pending vanc level
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   - Will obtain another TTE to evaluate for interval change in his
   cardiac function.
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   - Will restart the lasix gtt with a goal of keeping him even today as
   his CXR looks slightly drier.  Will increase the gtt when giving the 2
   units of PRBC as below.
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of cardiogenic vs septic shock, biliary obstruction, and respiratory failure. The patient has a 3-vessel disease (3VD) with left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) stenting, and has had a recent cardiac injury.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 88/61 mmHg, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a history of bleeding, with a hemoglobin drop from 26.2 to 23.1 g/dL, and is at risk for further bleeding due to his cardiac injury and the use of anticoagulant medications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine (Cr) levels, which may indicate sepsis or organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Cardiac support with dopamine and balloon pump
* Antibiotic therapy for possible sepsis and HCAP
* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen
* Gastrointestinal support with nasogastric suction and antacid medication
* Anemia management with blood transfusions and erythropoietin therapy
* Biliary obstruction management with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting
* Hepatic dysfunction management with liver function tests (LFTs) and monitoring of liver enzymes

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications: cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure
* Respiratory complications: respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Gastrointestinal complications: bleeding, perforation, and obstruction
* Hepatic complications: liver failure, bile leak, and sepsis

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  More likely to be septic shock as echo shows improved
   function, EF 50%.   Dopamine changed to levophed and pt has minimal
   pressor requirements.  IABP removed yesterday successfully.
   - continue Levophed as necessary
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient has been afebrile X 2 days,
   but given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now
   slightly improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging
   from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line placed.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - check vanc levels q3 doses.
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  More likely to be septic shock as echo shows improved
   function, EF 50%.   Dopamine changed to levophed and pt has minimal
   pressor requirements.  IABP removed yesterday successfully.
   - continue Levophed as necessary
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient has been afebrile X 2 days,
   but given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now
   slightly improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging
   from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line placed.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - check vanc levels q3 doses.
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HCC, HEP C, OLT, biliary obstruction, and possible MI and sepsis. The patient has undergone ERCP and rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, and has been intubated and sedated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's respiratory support is being maintained with mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.2, hemoglobin of 33, and platelet count of 158. The patient's liver function tests are slightly trending downward, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 34 and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 28. The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26 mg/dL.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continued empiric treatment for HCAP with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and coverage for fungi with fluconazole.
2. Continued monitoring of cultures and checking vancomycin levels every three doses.
3. Holding antihypertensives and continuing levophed as necessary.
4. Trending daily LFTs and following up with transplant surgery recommendations.
5. Continuing with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen as a source of infection.
6. Continuing to trend ARF and monitoring for signs of worsening kidney function.
7. Following up with transplant team and continuing cellcept and prograf.
8. Monitoring daily tacrolimus levels and adjusting as necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a bile leak in his abdomen.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of possible MI and is at risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and the presence of pneumonia.
4. Kidney injury: The patient is at risk for kidney injury due to his underlying kidney disease and the presence of ARF.
5. Bile leak: The patient has a bile leak in his abdomen, which can lead to further complications, including infection and abscess formation.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of a bile leak in his abdomen.
7. Organ failure: The patient is at risk for organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and kidney failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his medical plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Echo [**2107-1-11**]:   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and moderate hypokinesis
   of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
   50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Turning off the IABP, there was near akinesis of the distal inferior
   wall and more severe hypokinesis of the distal septum.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-8**], left
   ventricular systolic function is improved (may be related to IABP)..
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Echo [**2107-1-11**]:   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and moderate hypokinesis
   of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
   50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Turning off the IABP, there was near akinesis of the distal inferior
   wall and more severe hypokinesis of the distal septum.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-8**], left
   ventricular systolic function is improved (may be related to IABP)..
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept, holding Tacrolimus
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Hepatitis C, and Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT). He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of sepsis, possible myocardial infarction, and likely biliary obstruction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. His respiratory status is being managed with a ventilator, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 33 g/dL, and a platelet count of 158 K/uL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly trending downward, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 34 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 28 IU/L.

The patient's cardiac status is being monitored, with a cardiac index of 4.6 L/min/m2 and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%. He has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and moderate hypokinesis of the distal septum.

The patient's medical history is significant for a recent ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy, as well as a possible myocardial infarction and likely sepsis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic status may worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status may worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate, requiring dialysis or further intervention.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status may worsen, leading to bleeding, perforation, or other complications.
6. Infection: The patient may develop secondary infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or intra-abdominal infections.
7. Bleeding: The patient may experience bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient may experience cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiac rupture.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's care team is monitoring his vital signs closely, managing his respiratory status, and administering antibiotics and antifungals as necessary. The patient's immunosuppressive medications are being adjusted, and his surgical site is being monitored for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Extubated successfully in AM.  Off levophed at noon, BPs maintained
   well until 6pm, when SBP < 80.  I/Os were even, but NPO.   Gave 250cc
   NS bolus as CVP 6 at the time, BP responded to 110s.  Cx data negative
   to date, Vanco level 21, but Vanc dosing 1g [**Hospital1 **].  A-line removed as was
   cracked.   Per Transplant, holding Tacrolimus, will PTC tomorrow, NP
   past MN.  Transplant wanted to keep IJ for at least one more day.
   Patient was agitated early in am, was oriented x1, received zydis 5mg
   x1 w/ good effect.  On exam has myoclonic jerks, asterexis, and was
   later A&Ox0, w/ loss of immediate recall.  Started lactulose 30mg Q4h
   PO prn for 3-4BMs, NPO for PTC, so only received 2 doses, nonetheless,
   stooled Q1-2hrs, guiac positive.  Received an additional IVF bolus 250
   for SBP maintenance w/ BMs.

   # ANEMIA. HCT now stable, s/p 2 units of PRBCs 2 days ago.  Pt is guiac
   positive.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HCC, HEP C, OLT, and recent ERCP and roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy. He is currently in the ICU with shock, sepsis, and possible MI.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 127/78 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 758 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 14.2 K/uL and a C-reactive protein level of 147 mg/dL. His liver function tests are slightly abnormal, with a total bilirubin level of 1.2 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 109 IU/L.

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results suggest that he has sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, which is elevated and suggests that he has AKI.
3. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction is likely to cause further complications, including infection and sepsis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization showed 3VD, and he had a peak troponin level of 5.39 ng/mL, which suggests that he had a myocardial infarction.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's guaiac-positive stools suggest that he has gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to his biliary obstruction or his recent surgical intervention.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
2. Fluid resuscitation: The patient is receiving fluid resuscitation to treat his hypotension and shock.
3. Cardiac management: The patient is receiving aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Gastrointestinal management: The patient is receiving lactulose to treat his constipation and guaiac-positive stools.
5. Transplant surgery: The patient's transplant surgery is scheduled for today, and he will require close monitoring and management in the ICU.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, including sepsis, AKI, biliary obstruction, cardiac complications, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent further complications and to optimize his treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept, holding Tacrolimus
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Extubated successfully in AM.  Off levophed at noon, BPs maintained
   well until 6pm, when SBP < 80.  I/Os were even, but NPO.   Gave 250cc
   NS bolus as CVP 6 at the time, BP responded to 110s.  Cx data negative
   to date, Vanco level 21, but Vanc dosing 1g [**Hospital1 **].  A-line removed as was
   cracked.   Per Transplant, holding Tacrolimus, will PTC tomorrow, NP
   past MN.  Transplant wanted to keep IJ for at least one more day.
   Patient was agitated early in am, was oriented x1, received zydis 5mg
   x1 w/ good effect.  On exam has myoclonic jerks, asterexis, and was
   later A&Ox0, w/ loss of immediate recall.  Started lactulose 30mg Q4h
   PO prn for 3-4BMs, NPO for PTC, so only received 2 doses, nonetheless,
   stooled Q1-2hrs, guiac positive.  Received an additional IVF bolus 250

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HCC, HEP C, OLT, and recent ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to shock, possible MI, and likely sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.2°C, HR: 96 bpm, BP: 127/78 mmHg, SpO2: 95%
* Respiratory support: CPAP/PSV, FiO2: 40%
* Cardiovascular: IABP removed yesterday, echo shows improved EF of 50%
* Abdomen: Distended and tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or US
* Laboratory results: WBC: 14.2, Hct: 28.0, Plt: 158, Cr: 1.4, TCO2: 31, Glucose: 98
* Medical complications: Sepsis, possible PNA, ARF, biliary obstruction, HCC, and Hep C

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Pulmonary edema or ARDS due to respiratory failure
* Bile leak or infection from the Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy
* Hepatic dysfunction or failure due to HCC and Hep C
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to biliary obstruction
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock due to MI
* Opportunistic infections due to immunosuppression
* Renal failure or AKI due to ARF
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to glycemic control

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
* Holding antihypertensives
* Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
* Continue fluconazole given immunosuppression
* Attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other potential sources
* Continue Aspirin/Plavix
* Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
* Trend HCT and consider transfusion as necessary
* Attempt extubation today and wean sedation
* Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
* Trend daily LFTs and follow up with transplant surgery recommendations
* Continue cellcept and hold Tacrolimus
* Follow up daily Tacrolimus level

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical condition, and prompt attention to potential complications to prevent further deterioration."
