   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Consider re-tap of pleural effusions.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS here.
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT.
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia.
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replace with new CVL.
   # Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 942**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10533**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Consider re-tap of pleural effusions.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, with multiple areas of infiltrate and bilateral effusions on chest CT.
* Hyperammonemia: ammonia levels >200, with no clear reason for the elevation, and a possible connection to hypothyroidism or myeloma.
* Septic shock/hypotension: BP has improved, off pressors, with concerns for sepsis and a low threshold to add gram-negative coverage.
* Anasarca: profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion, and ascites, with a low albumin level and possible hypothyroidism.
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: worsening to stage 4 from baseline 2.5-3, thought to be due to DM, with a possible acute component from ATN, hypotension, and elevated vancomycin levels.
* Hypernatremia: likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin sloughing, medications, and possible diabetes insipidus.
* Thrombocytopenia: pattern of drop concerning for HIT, but PF4 negative, with a plan to hold heparin for now and place a heparin-free line.
* Metabolic acidosis: AG 17, worse in light of low albumin, possibly from renal failure.
* DM: ISS in progress.
* Recent PE/DVT: hold heparin for line, likely restart after line in place, with caution given thrombocytopenia.
* C. diff colitis: continue IV flagyl and precautions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 18.2
* Hct: 32.6
* Plt: 58
* Cr: 4.0
* TCO2: 17
* Glucose: 180
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 20.4/45.1/1.9, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 35//, ALT/AST: 22/36, Alk Phos/T Bili: 221/3.4, Amylase/Lipase: //4, Differential-Neuts: 89.7%, Lymph: 8.1%, Mono: 1.8%, Eos: 0.2%, Fibrinogen: 133 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.2 g/dL, LDH: 314 IU/L, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging results show:

* Abd US: echogenic liver indicative of hepatic steatosis, patent portal vein with normal hepatopetal flow, small ascites and left pleural effusion, and apparently dilated pancreatic duct without etiology.

The patient's plan includes:

* Repeat ammonia level and liver US and LFTs
* Check valproate level
* Thyroid workup
* Endocrine consult in the morning
* Hepatology consult in the morning
* Continue lactulose for now
* Monitor volume status closely and replete fluid and free water deficits
* Nutrition support, preferably enteral
* Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
* Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine) and UPEP/SPEP
* D5W at 125/hr to replete free water deficit
* Hold heparin for now and place a heparin-free line
* Continue IV flagyl for C. diff colitis
* Prophylaxis: heparin SC and PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Certainly wide differential. Abnormal thyroid
   function is concerning for myxedema coma, however  repeat free T4 less
   concerning. Elevated Ammonia is also unusual, however no clear
   etiology. Valproate level negative. Would also consider seizure and
   infectious encephalitis.
   - Check tox panels.
   - FU Hepatology Recs
   - FU Endocrine Recs
   - FU Neurology Recs
   - 24 hour eeg today
   - Consider imaging for encephalitis vs. LP.
   - Thyroid workup
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).
   - Would not extubate until mental status improves.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - FU hepatology recommendations.
   - FU Endocrine recommendations.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  Concern for sepsis vs. Volume depletion
   given insensible fluid loss. No documented new infections yet (previous
   diagnosis of C.diff).  Overnight with low MAPs. Levophed restarted.
   - Levophed to maintain MAPS>60
   - PICC line out, RIJ out tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   - may need transport to burn unit for further support if denuding
   continues.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but
   has received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently
   within normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).
   Does have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr:  Free Water deficit. 3.4 liters.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Discuss with Heme and consider starting argatroban.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS here.
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT.
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia.
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient has several potential medical complications that require attention:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely multifactorial, with possible causes including myxedema coma, infectious encephalitis, and seizure disorders. Further workup is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires close monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation. Daily sedation vacations are planned to assess his mental status.
3. Hyperammonemia: The patient's ammonia levels are elevated, which is unusual given his lack of clear hepatic disease. Further workup is needed to determine the cause.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient's low MAPs and levophed requirements suggest sepsis or volume depletion. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's low free T4 levels and normal TSH suggest possible hypothyroidism. Further workup is needed to determine the cause.
6. Rash: The patient's desquamative rash is likely related to his anasarca and changing volume status. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
7. Anasarca: The patient's profound diffuse anasarca is likely related to his hypothyroidism, CKD, and other underlying conditions.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's worsening renal function is likely related to his diabetes, ATN, and other underlying conditions.
9. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely iatrogenic, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to his sepsis and other underlying conditions.
11. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to his renal failure and other underlying conditions.

To address these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and further evaluation. The following interventions are planned:

* Check tox panels to determine the cause of the patient's encephalopathy
* FU Hepatology and Endocrine recommendations
* FU Neurology recommendations
* 24-hour EEG today
* Consider imaging for encephalitis vs. LP
* Thyroid workup
* Continue on AC settings and no sedation

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  Other than liver disease and toxins/meds,
   differential can also include myxedema coma (can also cause elevated
   ammonia) and had abnormal TFTs at OSH, though these were attributed to
   sick euthyroid.
   - Check tox panels.
   - Repeat ammonia here.
   - Repeat liver US and LFTs.
   - Check valproate level (?overdose/ingestion).
   - Thyroid workup as below.
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
   - Daily SBT.
   - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
   - Check valproate as above.
   - Endocrine workup.
   - Hepatology consult in AM.
   - Check SPEP/UPEP.
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   - Continue lactulose for now.
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Review CT with radiology.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   .
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  OSH
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  Dopa can also
   suppress TSH; ?contributing to discrepency of TSH and fT4.  Also
   consider secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially
   link edema, encephalopathy, depression, ?hypotension.
   - Endocrine to see in AM.
   - Recheck TFTs here.
   - Per endocrine curbside tonight, recheck cortisol, antibodies, PRL,
   ACTH.
   - Defer giving T4 until endocrine consult and cortisol studies (in case
   patient adrenally insufficient as well).
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Had derm see rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their
   evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash) and more likely
   affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on dependent portions
   of body).
   - Appreciate derm recs.
   - Avoid denuding more skin.
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG.
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficits.
   .
   # Anasarca.  Mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion,
   ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has received IV albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently within normal limits (mild
   diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does have CKD. Acute liver
   disease, Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process.
   - Renal involvement tomorrow or in near future.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension.
   - Check urine (protein, UA, NA, creatinine).
   - Check UPEP/SPEP.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement.
   - Place heparin free line.
   - Likely can safely restart given negative recent PF4; another one
   resent here.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS here.
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT.
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia.
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 69-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and hyperammonemia. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. His current condition includes:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient is minimally responsive, with a severe elevation in ammonia levels, and no clear reason for the liver disease or toxins/meds.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, with significant abnormalities on chest CT, and no plans to liberate from ventilation yet.
3. Hyperammonemia: The patient has elevated ammonia levels, with no clear reason for the liver disease or toxins/meds.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is now improved, off pressors, with concern for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet.
5. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over the extremities, with no mucosal lesions apparent.
6. Anasarca: The patient has mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion, and ascites, with low albumin and prealbumin levels.
7. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level has worsened to 4 from baseline 2.5-3, thought due to DM, with acute component from ATN, prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vancomycin levels, and other processes.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient has a likely iatrogenic hypernatremia due to free water losses from skin sloughing, meds, and other processes.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a pattern of drop that would be concerning for HIT, but PF4 is negative.
10. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 17, worsened by low albumin levels, and possibly related to renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is abnormal, with elevated liver enzymes, and concern for liver disease or toxins/meds.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has significant abnormalities on chest CT, with no plans to liberate from ventilation yet.
3. Sepsis: The patient has concern for sepsis at OSH, with no documented new infections yet, and off pressors.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, with worsening creatinine level, and concern for ATN, prerenal/overdiuresis, and other processes.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a pattern of drop that would be concerning for HIT, but PF4 is negative, and heparin is being held.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has a likely iatrogenic hypernatremia due to free water losses from skin sloughing, meds, and other processes.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 17, worsened by low albumin levels, and possibly related to renal failure.
8. C.diff colitis: The patient has a history of C.diff colitis, and IV flagyl is being continued.
9. HIT: The patient has a pattern of drop that would be concerning for HIT, but PF4 is negative, and heparin is being held.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Vancomycin
2. Zosyn
3. Lactulose
4. Metronidazole
5. Norepinephrine
6. Pantoprazole (Protonix)
7. Fentanyl
8. Colace
9. RISS
10. Meropenem

The patient's current laboratory results include:

1. Ammonia level: >200
2. Liver enzymes: Elevated
3. Creatinine: 4
4. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): Elevated
5. Potassium: Elevated
6. Sodium: Elevated
7. Albumin: Low
8. Prealbumin: Low
9. Thyroid function tests (TFTs): Abnormal
10. Complete blood count (CBC): Abnormal

The patient's current imaging results include:

1. Chest CT: Abnormal
2. Abdominal CT: Abnormal
3. Echocardiogram: Abnormal

The patient's current plan includes:

1. Continue lactulose for hyperammonemia
2. Check valproate level
3. Repeat liver US and LFTs
4. Check thyroid function tests
5. Continue IV flagyl for C.diff colitis
6. Hold heparin for line placement
7. Place heparin-free line
8. Monitor volume status closely
9. Replete fluid and free water deficits
10. Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH"

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   - Check lactate.
   - Urine for ketones.
   - Venous pH.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
   - Precautions.
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replace with new CVL.

      WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):    No significant growth.
   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. Hyperammonemia may be
   contributing to component of hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic
   dysfunction may prolong the time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal
   thyroid function initially concerning for myxedema coma, but less
   likely at this time. Would also consider seizure and infectious
   encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Consider extubate despite poor mental status
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - No sedation
   - VAP bundle
   - Daily SBT
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Concern for
   sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No documented
   new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed currently
   off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body).
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG
   - Monitor volume status closely; replete fluid and free water deficit
   aggressively as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider early renal consult for consideration of HD vs. CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal involvement
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal involvement
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   .
   # DM.
   - ISS
   .
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replace with new CVL.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 EEG - At [**2171-2-16**] 01:03 PM
 STOOL CULTURE - At [**2171-2-16**] 06:25 PM
   sent for c-diff
   - KUB wet read without frank dilatation or obstruction seen.
   - Hematology curbside consult recommended starting agatroban given
   concern for HIT, re-obtain PF4 and serotonin release.
   - Hepatology recommended IV thiamine (ordered), replace thyroxine (not
   ordered due to endocrinology recommendations), continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics, lactulose NG and enema daily, supportive care.
   - Endocrine recommended to 1) check full thyroid panel including TSH,
   total T4, total T3, T3 uptake - no treatment with thyroid hormone
   indicated at this time (ordered); 2) check free cortisol - no steroids
   at this time (ordered); 3) replace free water slowly; 4) continue ISS
   - Neurology recommended to continue 24 bedside EEG to see if he
   improves at all given more time off Versed, to get NCHCT to evaluate
   for grey-white matter differentiation once EEG leads are off, and to
   consider MRI/LP in the future if the patient does not improve.
   - [**Hospital1 10551**] formula of 18% of body surface area burn over back 7.2L over
   first 24 hours; 3.6L over first 8 hours. Ordered LR and will recheck
   electrolytes.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with significant fluid loss, electrolyte imbalances, and multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase)
* Hyperammonemia (ammonia levels >200)
* Hypothyroidism (low free T4 and TSH)
* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 54)
* Elevated lactate levels (1.9 mmol/L)
* Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.48, bicarbonate 18 mmol/L)
* Hypernatremia (sodium 152 mmol/L)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Profound diffuse anasarca
* Bilateral pulmonary effusions
* Small pericardial effusion
* Ascites
* Desquamative rash over the extremities
* No mucosal lesions
* Decreased mental status

The patient's diagnosis is complex and multifactorial, with several potential contributing factors, including:

* Sepsis/hypotension
* Hyperammonemia
* Hypothyroidism
* Anasarca
* Acute kidney injury
* Metabolic acidosis
* Hypernatremia
* Thrombocytopenia
* C. difficile colitis

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Supportive care, including fluid repletion, electrolyte management, and respiratory support
* Antibiotics for suspected sepsis and C. difficile colitis
* Antithrombotic therapy for suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Endocrinology consultation for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism
* Hepatology consultation for hyperammonemia and liver dysfunction
* Renal consultation for acute kidney injury
* Dermatology consultation for desquamative rash
* Neurology consultation for encephalopathy

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   antibiotics, lactulose NG and enema daily, supportive care.
   - Endocrine recommended to 1) check full thyroid panel including TSH,
   total T4, total T3, T3 uptake - no treatment with thyroid hormone
   indicated at this time (ordered); 2) check free cortisol - no steroids
   at this time (ordered); 3) replace free water slowly; 4) continue ISS
   - Neurology recommended to continue 24 bedside EEG to see if he
   improves at all given more time off Versed, to get NCHCT to evaluate
   for grey-white matter differentiation once EEG leads are off, and to
   consider MRI/LP in the future if the patient does not improve.
   - [**Hospital1 10551**] formula of 18% of body surface area burn over back 7.2L over

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EEG - At [**2171-2-16**] 01:03 PM
 STOOL CULTURE - At [**2171-2-16**] 06:25 PM
   sent for c-diff
   - KUB wet read without frank dilatation or obstruction seen.
   - Hematology curbside consult recommended starting agatroban given
   concern for HIT, re-obtain PF4 and serotonin release.
   - Hepatology recommended IV thiamine (ordered), replace thyroxine (not
   ordered due to endocrinology recommendations), continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics, lactulose NG and enema daily, supportive care.
   - Endocrine recommended to 1) check full thyroid panel including TSH,
   total T4, total T3, T3 uptake - no treatment with thyroid hormone
   indicated at this time (ordered); 2) check free cortisol - no steroids
   at this time (ordered); 3) replace free water slowly; 4) continue ISS
   - Neurology recommended to continue 24 bedside EEG to see if he
   improves at all given more time off Versed, to get NCHCT to evaluate
   for grey-white matter differentiation once EEG leads are off, and to
   consider MRI/LP in the future if the patient does not improve.
   - [**Hospital1 10551**] formula of 18% of body surface area burn over back 7.2L over
   first 24 hours; 3.6L over first 8 hours. Ordered LR and will recheck
   electrolytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following potential medical complications:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy, which may be caused by hypotension, hyperammonemia, or other underlying conditions. The patient's condition is critical, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently being treated for septic shock. The patient's labs show evidence of inflammation, and the patient is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's free T4 levels are low, and the patient is at risk for hypothyroidism. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's hypothyroidism.
4. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, which may be caused by hypothyroidism, kidney disease, or other underlying conditions. The patient's condition is critical, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's kidney function is worsening, and the patient is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is worsening, and the patient is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be caused by free water losses from skin sloughing, medications, or other underlying conditions. The patient's condition is critical, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia.
9. Recent PE/DVT: The patient has a history of recent PE/DVT, and the patient is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
10. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and the patient is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging studies if necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis and septic shock with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's hypothyroidism and anasarca with imaging studies and endocrinology consultation.
4. Continue to manage the patient's kidney disease with dialysis and fluid repletion.
5. Continue to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate therapy and electrolyte repletion.
6. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia with fluid repletion and electrolyte repletion.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet function studies and consultation with a hematologist.
8. Continue to manage the patient's recent PE/DVT with anticoagulation therapy and supportive care.
9. Continue to manage the patient's C. difficile colitis with antibiotics and supportive care.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  - Thyroid workup as below. Most likely
   hypoxic/hypotensive brain/kidney/liver injury
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
    - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
    - Check valproate as above.
    Head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   -Continue lactulose for now.
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  Endocrine
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Ask Briham Burn Unit for rec's on care
   # Anasarca.  Mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion,
   ascites.  Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has received IV albumin
   [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.  Low prealbumin.  TTE recently within normal limits (mild
   diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does have CKD. Acute liver
   disease, Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above.
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral).
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension, prerenal/overdiuresis,
   elevated vanc levels, other process.
    # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W x 2 liters at 125/hr.
   - Further adjustment based on response to above.
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative.
   - Will hold heparin for now given line placement
   _On Argatroban
   # Metabolic acidosis.  AG 17 - worse in light of low albumin.  ?from
   renal failure.
   # DM.
    - ISS here.
   # Recent PE/DVT.
    Argatroban because of HIT
   - Hold heparin for line as above; likely restart after line in place,
   though care given thrombocytopenia
   # C.diff colitis.
   - Continue IV flagyl.
    - Precautions.
   # FEN: D5W as above, replete electrolytes, slow start TFs (?ileus at
   OSH).  No TPN for now.
   # Prophylaxis: boots, PPI
   # Access: RIJ from OSH; replaced with new CVL.
   # Communication: wife [**Name (NI) 942**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10533**]
   # Code:  Full (discussed with family)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   # Encephalopathy.  Currently minimally responsive despite no sedatives
   (did get some midazolam at times during his OSH ICU stay, not clear
   when last received).  Very elevated ammonia level concerning.  No known
   liver disease prior to this admission.  No other meds that has been on
   immediately able to be implicated.  Depression but family strongly
   doubts other ingestions, and seems to have become markedly worse during
   hospital course.  - Thyroid workup as below. Most likely
   hypoxic/hypotensive brain/kidney/liver injury
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated primarily for airway protection; no
   documentation of oxygenation or ventilation problems prior to
   intubation (satting 100% on 2L).  Does have significant abnls on chest
   CT however (multiple areas of infiltrate, RUL ?consolidation vs. mass,
   bilateral effusions).  With worsening of mental status, no plans to
   liberate from vent yet.
   - Continue on AC settings.
   - No sedation.
    - VAP bundle.
   - Consider Aline for ABG monitoring vs. watching sats and VBGs.
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH.
   Unexpected finding, as no clear reason to have hepatic encephalopathy.
   Too old for genetic metbolic disorders to manifest.  Hypothyroidism can
   lead to hyperammonemia, as can myeloma.  ?influence of TPN.
    - Check valproate as above.
    Head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
   -Continue lactulose for now.
   # Septic shock/hypotension.  BPs now improved, off pressors.  Concern
   for sepsis at OSH; no documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis
   of C.diff).
   - PICC line out, tip culture pending.
   - Check blood cultures.
   - Urine culture.
   - Send sputum and check CXR.
   - Antibiotics: vanco around (level >40) for coverage of line infection;
   will continue IV flagyl given C.diff.  Low threshold to add gram
   negative coverage as well (will hold off for now given desquamative
   rash).
   # ?Hypothyroidism.  Low free TFTs on OSH labs.  Normal TSH.  Endocrine
   thought c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low.  .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Ask Briham Burn Unit for rec's on care
   # Anasarca.  Mild diffuse anasarca, small pericardial effusion,

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 69-year-old man with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and hyperammonemia. He has also developed septic shock, hypotension, and desquamative rash. The patient's laboratory results show elevated ammonia levels, low free thyroid hormone levels, and hypernatremia. He has a history of recent PE/DVT and is currently on argatroban due to HIT.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hypoxic/hypotensive brain/kidney/liver injury**: The patient's severe encephalopathy and respiratory failure may be related to hypoxic and hypotensive injuries to the brain, kidneys, and liver.
2. **Hepatic encephalopathy**: The patient's hyperammonemia and elevated ammonia levels may indicate hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
3. **Septic shock/hypotension**: The patient's septic shock and hypotension may be related to an underlying infection, which needs to be identified and treated promptly.
4. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to HIT, which requires careful management to prevent bleeding complications.
5. **Metabolic acidosis**: The patient's metabolic acidosis may be related to his underlying renal failure and may require prompt correction to prevent further complications.
6. **Hypernatremia**: The patient's hypernatremia may be related to free water losses from skin sloughing and medications, which requires prompt correction to prevent further complications.
7. **C.diff colitis**: The patient's C.diff colitis requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and precautions to prevent further complications.
8. **FEN**: The patient's FEN requires careful management to prevent further complications, including ileus and electrolyte imbalances.
9. **Hypothyroidism**: The patient's low free thyroid hormone levels may indicate hypothyroidism, which requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple complex medical conditions, including encephalopathy, respiratory failure, septic shock, and hyperammonemia. Close monitoring and prompt management of these conditions are crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with severe encephalopathy, anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient's condition is characterized by:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy, which is likely related to anoxic brain injury, hyperammonemia, and possible hepatic dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to central etiology.
3. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash, particularly over the extremities, which is likely related to anasarca and changing volume status.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient has had hypotension in the past, which may be related to sepsis or volume depletion.
5. Hyperammonemia: The patient has high ammonia levels, which are unexpected given his lack of liver disease.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has low free thyroid function tests, which may be related to sick euthyroid syndrome or secondary/pituitary problem.
7. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to diabetes and acute tubular necrosis.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has worsening metabolic acidosis, likely related to renal failure.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to iatrogenic free water losses from skin sloughing, medications, and other processes.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
12. Recent PE/DVT: The patient has a recent pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.
13. h/o C.Diff colitis: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis.

The patient's medical team is considering the following potential medical complications:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's encephalopathy may be related to anoxic brain injury, which could lead to poor prognosis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hyperammonemia and possible hepatic dysfunction may lead to worsening encephalopathy.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock/hypotension may lead to further organ dysfunction and poor outcome.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency may lead to further worsening of his condition.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient's thrombocytopenia and recent PE/DVT may lead to further thrombotic events.
6. Skin denudation: The patient's skin denudation may lead to further complications, including infection and fluid loss.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Neurology consultation to assess the patient's encephalopathy and potential anoxic brain injury.
2. Endocrinology consultation to evaluate the patient's thyroid function and potential pituitary problem.
3. Hepatology consultation to evaluate the patient's liver function and potential hepatic dysfunction.
4. Renal consultation to evaluate the patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency and potential need for hemodialysis.
5. Thrombocytopenia treatment with argatroban and hold heparin.
6. Skin care to prevent further denudation and promote wound healing.
7. Fluid repletion to correct hypernatremia and hypovolemia.
8. Nutrition support to prevent malnutrition and promote wound healing.
9. Antibiotics to treat potential infections, including C. difficile colitis.
10. Pain management to promote comfort and prevent further complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Family Meeting to discuss code status and goals of care.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Will hold on plastics input at this time.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   sick euthyroid.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W to replete free water deficit of 4.4 L.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes this PM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   - Resend PF4, serotonin release assay
   .
   # Recent PE/DVT
   - Hold heparin at this time
   - Start argatroban
   .
   # h/o C.Diff colitis.
   - Continue precaution
   - Continue antibiotics as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.
   - Vancomcyin level 35.1 - continuing to hold
   - Still very hyper-Na/Cl lytes. Gave D51/2NS and stated water flushes
   of OG. Repeated lytes at 22:00 -

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury, however was a relatively
   short period. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy, however ammonia was high prior to major decline
   in mental status. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the time it
   takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially concerning
   for myxedema coma, but less likely given Thyroid Function that looks
   like sick euthyroid. Valproic level < 3; less likely ingestion. EEG
   with concern for anoxic brain injury. Very poor prognosis at this
   stage.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Family Meeting to discuss code status and goals of care.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L). Large tidal
   volumes, low respiratory rate most likely secondary to central
   etiology.
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Will hold on plastics input at this time.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent
   sick euthyroid.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - D5W to replete free water deficit of 4.4 L.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes this PM
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia.  Pattern of drop would be concerning for HIT.
   However, PF4 negative. Suspicion is high.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe encephalopathy, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient's condition has deteriorated rapidly, and he is now at high risk of mortality.

The patient's medical issues include:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy is likely caused by anoxic brain injury, but other possible causes include hyperammonemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypothyroidism.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory failure is likely due to central nervous system depression.
3. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash on his extremities, which is likely related to anasarca and changing volume status.
4. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved, but he is still at risk for sepsis and hypotension due to his underlying medical conditions.
5. Hyperammonemia: The patient's ammonia levels are elevated, which is unexpected given his lack of liver disease. Possible causes include hypothyroidism, multiple myeloma, or genetic metabolic disorder.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's free thyroxine levels are low, which is likely due to sick euthyroid syndrome.
7. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion, which is likely related to his underlying medical conditions.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function has worsened, and he is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his underlying medical conditions.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to his underlying medical conditions.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely iatrogenic due to free water losses from his skin sloughing and medications.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
12. Recent PE/DVT: The patient has a recent pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.
13. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis.
14. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes, which is likely contributing to his underlying medical conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further deterioration of encephalopathy and respiratory failure
2. Sepsis and hypotension due to underlying medical conditions
3. Progression of anasarca and pleural effusions
4. Acute kidney injury due to underlying medical conditions
5. Metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia
6. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
7. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis
8. C. difficile colitis and sepsis
9. Hypothyroidism and myxedema coma
10. Hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure

Recommendations:

1. Follow Neurology recommendations to assess the patient's encephalopathy and potential brain injury.
2. Follow Endocrinology recommendations to assess the patient's hypothyroidism and potential pituitary dysfunction.
3. Follow Hepatology recommendations to assess the patient's liver function and potential liver failure.
4. Continue lactulose to manage hyperammonemia.
5. Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
6. Consider renal consult for consideration of hemodialysis pending neurology recommendations.
7. Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, and hypotension to prevent acute kidney injury.
8. Monitor electrolytes and adjust fluids and medications accordingly.
9. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy to manage C. difficile colitis.
10. Consider burn care consult pending neurology recommendations."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.
   - Vancomcyin level 35.1 - continuing to hold

   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).
   - Unlikely candidate for SBT, extubation at this time given diffuse
   encephalopathy

   # Rash. Desquamative particularly over extremities.  No mucosal lesions
   obvious.  Dermatology has evaluated rash to rule out [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/TEN. Per their evaluation, less likely inflammatory (drug rash)
   and more likely affects of anasarca and changing volume status (on
   dependent portions of body). Question whether hypoperfusion of skin may
   also lead to these changes. Nursing staff concerned regarding care of
   skin denudation.
   - Follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Avoid denuding more skin
   - Wound recs - Aquacel AG and Silvadene
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids as if burn patient (consider burn unit if further denuding
   occurs)
   - Consider burn care consult pending neuro recommendations
   .
   # Septic shock/hypotension. Hypotension currently improved. Previous
   concern for sepsis vs volume depletion given insensible fluid loss. No
   documented new infections yet (previous diagnosis of C.diff).  Levophed
   currently off. Unable to load outside hospital CT in our PACS system.
   - Consider Levophed to maintain MAP > 60
   - Follow cultures including PICC tip
   - Daily blood culture
   - Trend CXR
   - Send sputum
   - Consider re-imaging CT
   - Continue Vancomycin PO, Flagyl, Cefepime
   - Low threshold for skin wound culture given concern for Pseudomonas
   .
   # Hyperammonemia.  Ammonia levels >200 on multiple checks at OSH and
   continues to be at that level here. Unexpected finding, as no clear
   reason to have hepatic encephalopathy. Question whether component of it
   is related with TPN. Otherwise, consider hypothyroidism, multiple
   myeloma (also likely given lack of anion gap). Patient age unlikely for
   genetic metabolic disorder.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   - Continue lactulose
   - Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypothyroidism. Low free TFTs on OSH labs. Normal TSH.  OSH thought
   c/w sick euthyroid, but free T4 very low. Dopa can also suppress TSH
   and may be contributing to discrepancy of TSH and fT4.  Also consider
   secondary/pituitary problem.  If present could potentially link edema,
   encephalopathy, depression, hypotension.
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Defer treatment at this time as likely sick euthyroid
   .
   # Anasarca.  Profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, ascites. Low albumin at OSH; now improved but has
   received IV albumin [**Hospital1 **] at OSH. Low prealbumin. TTE recently within
   normal limits (mild diastolic dysfunction, otherwise normal).  Does
   have CKD.  Concern for hypothyroidism as above.
   - Workup as above
   - Nutrition support (prefer enteral)
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Worsening to 4 from baseline
   2.5-3.  Thought due to DM.  Acute component - ATN from hypotension,
   prerenal/overdiuresis, elevated vanc levels, other process. FeNa 6%.
   Appropriate salt wasting [**2-26**] hypernatremia or ATN.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   - Avoid further renal insults, nephrotoxins, hypotension
   - Follow SPEP/UPEP
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis. Worsening at this time also in light of low
   albumin. Question etiology from renal failure.
   - Consider renal consult for consideration of HD pending neuro
   recommendations
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Likely iatrogenic with free water losses from skin
   sloughing, meds, etc.  Also consider DI if concerned for pituitary
   process.  Significant free water deficit.
   - Aggressive fluid repletion; [**Hospital1 10551**] formula deficit 7.2L over
   24hours for 18% denuded surface area
   - Will need to calculate for insensible losses and replete aggressively
   with fluids
   - Monitor electrolytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with dermatology in the AM and they recommended bariatric bed,
   silvadene. They will stop by in the PM - they recommend Aquacel AG.
   Bacitracin written for in case needed given near exhaustion of supply
   of Aquacel AG.
   - Nurses expressing concern about care and are suggesting possible
   transfer to burn unit.
   - Plastics asked to come in a.m. - will need to be consulted in a.m.
   - Neurology read head CT as reduced grey/white distinction in parietal
   cortex with effacement of gyri posteriorly. Read EEG as markedly
   reduced amplitude, without obvious slow activity - not really
   consistent with metabolic encephalopathy, nor PRES. Most consistent
   with anoxic injury. Wise to attempt correction of metabolic
   disturbance. Avoid sedation. Repeat CT or perform MRI on [**2-18**] (edema
   likely more evident then). No need for 24 hr EEG given no seizure
   activity.
   - 24 hr EEG started. Can possibly be stopped on [**2-18**].
   - Talked to wife, daughters and other family members. Described likely
   brain injury with poor prognosis. Discussed this as a decision point -
   i.e. neurologic injury will be something that we discuss with family in
   planning further goals. They have begun to speak about this. Mentioned
   importance of staying on top of serious skin condition while
   determining neurologic prognosis.
   - Vancomcyin level 35.1 - continuing to hold
   - Still very hyper-Na/Cl lytes. Gave D51/2NS and stated water flushes
   of OG. Repeated lytes at 22:00 -

   Assessment and Plan
   69M with CKD, DM, bladder cancer, laryngeal cancer; admitted with
   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary
   effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred
   from OSH to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.
   .
   # Encephalopathy.  Wide differential. Reports of hypotension previously
   can indicate component of anoxic brain injury. This might explain
   components of renal failure [**2-26**] poor perfusion and skin sloughing also
   [**2-26**] poor perfusion. Hyperammonemia may be contributing to component of
   hepatic encephalopathy. Possible hepatic dysfunction may prolong the
   time it takes to clear Versed. Abnormal thyroid function initially
   concerning for myxedema coma, but less likely at this time. Would also
   consider seizure and infectious encephalitis. Valproic level < 3; less
   likely ingestion.
   - Follow Neurology recommendations; appreciate their input and
   assessment of poor activity on 20 minute EKG. This will determine how
   we manage dermatology, renal, burn care consults as below.
   - Continue 24 hour EEG
   - Consider MRI/LP if patient does not improve
   - Follow Endocrinology recommendations; appreciate their input; await
   endocrinologic workup
   - Follow Hepatology recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Patient was intubated primarily for airway
   protection and there is no documentation of oxygenation or ventilation
   problems prior to intubation (was saturating 100% on 2L).

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the hospital with worsening anasarca, bilateral pulmonary effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has severe encephalopathy with a wide differential diagnosis, including anoxic brain injury, hypotension, hyperammonemia, and possible hepatic dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a high risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions.
3. Rash: The patient has a desquamative rash on his extremities, which is likely related to anasarca and changing volume status.
4. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension and sepsis, and is currently being treated with vancomycin, flagyl, and cefepime.
5. Hyperammonemia: The patient has elevated ammonia levels, which are unexpected given his lack of liver disease.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has low free T4 levels, which are concerning for hypothyroidism.
7. Anasarca: The patient has profound diffuse anasarca, pleural effusions, and small pericardial effusion.
8. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's kidney function has worsened, and he is at risk for acute kidney injury.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has worsening metabolic acidosis, which is likely related to his underlying conditions.
10. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is likely iatrogenic and related to free water losses from skin sloughing and medications.
11. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is concerning for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
12. Recent PE/DVT: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Follow-up with neurology recommendations to determine the best course of action for managing his encephalopathy.
2. Continue 24-hour EEG to monitor for seizure activity.
3. Consider MRI/LP if the patient does not improve.
4. Follow up with endocrinology and hepatology recommendations to manage his hypothyroidism and hyperammonemia.
5. Continue lactulose to manage his hyperammonemia.
6. Consider re-head CT to evaluate for cerebral edema.
7. Continue vancomycin, flagyl, and cefepime to manage his septic shock/hypotension.
8. Hold heparin and start argatroban to manage his thrombocytopenia.
9. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
10. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust his fluids accordingly.
11. Consider renal consult for consideration of hemodialysis pending neurology recommendations.
12. Continue to update the patient's family on his condition and any changes to his plan of care.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful management to address his multiple medical issues."

   dyspnea on exertion also with worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions,
   and subacute physical and cognitive decline; now transferred from OSH
   to [**Hospital1 1**] with severe encephalopathy.  He has multiple problems feeding
   into his critical illness but no unifying diagnosis.  Unfortunately,
   even without a diagnosis, with his degree and number of organ failures,
   hypoalbunemia, poor neurologic function, his prognosis is grim.
   # Encephalopathy.  Appreciate ongoing neuro input.  Getting EEG.  CT
   scan with perhaps some evidence of anoxic injury - but he has no
   documented episodes of anoxia.
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated initially of airway protection -
   mental status remains very poor.  He has a high MV that is partially a
   response to metabolic acidosis and also partially likely central in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, worsening anasarca, bilateral effusions, and subacute physical and cognitive decline. The patient has multiple organ failures, including respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and renal failure. He is intubated for airway protection and has a high metabolic rate due to metabolic acidosis and central etiology.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hypernatremia (153 mEq/L)
* Hyperammonemia (207 mg/dL)
* Hypoalbunemia (31.5%)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 22/33)
* Elevated alkaline phosphatase (241 IU/L)
* Thrombocytopenia (60 K/uL)
* Chronic kidney disease (Cr 3.8 mg/dL)

The patient has a poor prognosis due to the severity of his condition, multiple organ failures, and lack of a unifying diagnosis. The patient's family will need to be informed about the poor prognosis, and a frank discussion will be necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to his chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated, and his respiratory failure may worsen due to his metabolic acidosis and central etiology.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy may progress, leading to further decline in his cognitive function and overall condition.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to further decline in his renal function and increased risk of complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to an increased risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to further complications such as seizures, coma, and even death.
7. Hypoalbunemia: The patient's hypoalbunemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as malnutrition, weakness, and increased risk of infections.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of mortality.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Re-image depending on Neurology advice
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Re-image depending on Neurology advice
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 69-year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental status, anasarca, and desquamating skin reaction.
* He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with shortness of breath, slurred speech, and somnolent state.
* The patient is currently intubated and on pressors, with a history of hypotension.
* He is unresponsive and unable to provide a history.
* The patient has a poor prognosis, and a family meeting is scheduled for Tuesday to discuss goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Increased risk of sepsis due to desquamating skin reaction and anasarca.
2. Risk of further decline in mental status due to ongoing cortical injury and potential ammonia toxicity.
3. Risk of electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders due to ongoing metabolic derangements.
4. Risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications due to decreased platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time.
5. Risk of infection due to presence of central lines, arterial lines, and potential skin breakdown.
6. Risk of respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory support and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Risk of cardiac arrest due to ongoing hypotension and potential cardiac compromise.
8. Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis and potential underlying coagulopathy.
9. Risk of further organ dysfunction due to ongoing multi-organ failure.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities:

* Elevated ammonia levels
* Hypernatremia
* Low ceruloplasmin
* Decreased platelet count
* Prolonged prothrombin time
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Abnormal electrolyte levels

The patient's imaging studies, including ECG and radiology reports, are pending.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Correcting sodium and rechecking ammonia levels
* Stopping all sedation and analgesic medications
* Re-imaging depending on Neurology advice
* Continuing ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia if possible
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Do not re-image for now
 unlikely helpful
   # Adventitious head movements
   Several muscle groups
 therefore cortical. Suggestive of seizure
   activity. Secondary to anoxic injury with some sparing of motorneurons
   versus edema and mass effect.
   - Dilantin 1 g then check in 4 hrs; 100 mg TID after
   - Imaging not indicated at the moment.
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening. Not
   likely [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] Derm., who think that this is most likely secondary to
   previously dramatic anasarca and then microtrauma of being in bed.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics (started for
   pneumonia/sepsis/C.diff) given unable to apply antimicrobial
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
   - Appreciate Dermatology input
   - Treat as for burn
 copious fluids that respect hypernatremia and low
   bicarbonate
   # Respiratory Failure
   Agonal brainstem breathing, +/- liver breathing. Appears brainstem also
   affected based on reflexes/exam, thus likely neurologic. Also
   contributions by expansion acidosis.
   - Continue AC ventilation compatible with central rhythm
   # Goals of Care
   - Family meeting at 3 p.m. today.
   # Hypotension
   Clear loss of spinal reflexes and pupils small suggesting sympathetic
   output likely lower at brainstem or spinal level.
   - Continue fluid support as indicated by urine output (fluid balance
   not accurate due to cutaneous losses)
   - Low threshold to use pressors to stabilize while determining goals of
   care
   # Hyperammonemia
   Unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] late to present with metabolic disorder, although not
   impossible. No valproic acid recently. Has liver failure and pancreatic
   calcification of unknown etiology. Family claim little to no alcohol
   use.
   - Repeat ammonia level today
   # ESR
   Was 0 in OSH. This means no settling over one hour. Should therefore be
   suspicious for inflammatory causes of this presentation.
   - Repeat ESR
   # Hypothyroidism
   Likely sick euthyroid.
   # Hypernatremia
   Corrected quite quickly
 concerning. 5 mEq over nine hours maximal
   rate from labs. Unlikely problem in itself, but may be edema from
   anoxic brain injury and the two together may become significant.
   - [**Hospital1 **] labs and caution with solutions that contain no sodium. 1/2NS
   likely okay because of hypotonic skin losses
   # Anasarca
   Liver failure, low albumin and renal failure, now with large fluid
   shift and protein losses through skin. Will likely worsen.
   # Renal failure
   Creatinine now lower, but not baseline (2.2) suggesting that we are
   keeping up with fluid requirement.
   -Continue fluids
   # Liver failure
   Unclear cause. Fatty changes suggested by ultrasound. [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of
   low albumin, low ceruloplasmin
   # Low ceruloplasmin
   (5) in OSH. Not low enough for [**Location (un) 1729**]
s and metabolism likely disturbed
   with liver failure. Acerulopasminemia or Menkes do not fit. Would not
   explain present event.
   # PE/DVT
   - Continue intermittent argatroban (lowest dose deliverable too high,
   so will need to try 3 hours on 3 hours off today (previous minimum dose
   halving should be good estimation as first step.
   # C. diff.
   In OSH. Therefore flagyl and precautions.
   # Antibiotics
   Started for PNA/sepsis and now likely providing broad coverage for open
   skin.
   - Continue for now.
   # DM
   Well controlled at present.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5502**] is a 69 year-old man with sub-acute decline in mental
   status, anasarca that presented to [**Hospital 327**] Hospital with shortness of
   breath on [**2170-2-2**]. At that time his ammonia level was 223 and he was
   slurring speech and somewhat somnolent. He spent 10 days on the floor.
   During the admission he was transferred to the ICU, intubated and
   started on pressors. It appears that hypotension was an issue at that
   time. He became unresponsive at this time, we think, although this is
   not well documented. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] with desquamative skin
   and comatose.
   # Altered mental status
   Numerous contribitors are present, but the overall picture is that of
   vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain
   injury. There are no findings that argue against this specifically,
   although very ammonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin (5 at OSH)
   may be contributing. Release signs are present with prominent snout
   reflex and wincing on corneal. Non-localizing withdrawal of right arm
   on tactile stimulation.
   - Correct sodium and recheck ammonia if possible
   - Stop all sedation and analgesic medications given no evidence of
   cortical function
   - Do not re-image for now
 unlikely helpful
   # Adventitious head movements
   Several muscle groups
 therefore cortical. Suggestive of seizure
   activity. Secondary to anoxic injury with some sparing of motorneurons
   versus edema and mass effect.
   - Dilantin 1 g then check in 4 hrs; 100 mg TID after
   - Imaging not indicated at the moment.
   # Desquamating skin reaction
   Unclear etiology, but unifying diagnosis would be heartening. Not
   likely [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 24**] Derm., who think that this is most likely secondary to
   previously dramatic anasarca and then microtrauma of being in bed.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics (started for
   pneumonia/sepsis/C.diff) given unable to apply antimicrobial
   - [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes
   - Appreciate Dermatology input
   - Treat as for burn
 copious fluids that respect hypernatremia and low
   bicarbonate
   # Respiratory Failure
   Agonal brainstem breathing, +/- liver breathing. Appears brainstem also
   affected based on reflexes/exam, thus likely neurologic. Also
   contributions by expansion acidosis.
   - Continue AC ventilation compatible with central rhythm
   # Goals of Care
   - Family meeting at 3 p.m. today.
   # Hypotension
   Clear loss of spinal reflexes and pupils small suggesting sympathetic
   output likely lower at brainstem or spinal level.
   - Continue fluid support as indicated by urine output (fluid balance
   not accurate due to cutaneous losses)
   - Low threshold to use pressors to stabilize while determining goals of
   care
   # Hyperammonemia
   Unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] late to present with metabolic disorder, although not
   impossible. No valproic acid recently. Has liver failure and pancreatic
   calcification of unknown etiology. Family claim little to no alcohol
   use.
   - Repeat ammonia level today
   # ESR
   Was 0 in OSH. This means no settling over one hour. Should therefore be
   suspicious for inflammatory causes of this presentation.
   - Repeat ESR
   # Hypothyroidism
   Likely sick euthyroid.
   # Hypernatremia
   Corrected quite quickly
 concerning. 5 mEq over nine hours maximal
   rate from labs. Unlikely problem in itself, but may be edema from
   anoxic brain injury and the two together may become significant.
   - [**Hospital1 **] labs and caution with solutions that contain no sodium. 1/2NS
   likely okay because of hypotonic skin losses
   # Anasarca
   Liver failure, low albumin and renal failure, now with large fluid
   shift and protein losses through skin. Will likely worsen.
   # Renal failure
   Creatinine now lower, but not baseline (2.2) suggesting that we are
   keeping up with fluid requirement.
   -Continue fluids
   # Liver failure
   Unclear cause. Fatty changes suggested by ultrasound. [**Month (only) 11**] be cause of
   low albumin, low ceruloplasmin
   # Low ceruloplasmin
   (5) in OSH. Not low enough for [**Location (un) 1729**]
s and metabolism likely disturbed
   with liver failure. Acerulopasminemia or Menkes do not fit. Would not
   explain present event.
   # PE/DVT
   - Continue intermittent argatroban (lowest dose deliverable too high,
   so will need to try 3 hours on 3 hours off today (previous minimum dose
   halving should be good estimation as first step.
   # C. diff.
   In OSH. Therefore flagyl and precautions.
   # Antibiotics
   Started for PNA/sepsis and now likely providing broad coverage for open
   skin.
   - Continue for now.
   # DM
   Well controlled at present.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old man with a sub-acute decline in mental status, anasarca, and desquamating skin reaction. He was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have an ammonia level of 223, slurred speech, and somnolence. He was transferred to the ICU, intubated, and started on pressors.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is comatose with no cortical function, suggesting anoxic brain injury. The presence of release signs and withdrawal reflexes suggests that some motor neurons may be spared.
2. Desquamating skin reaction: The etiology of this reaction is unclear, but it is likely secondary to microtrauma and anasarca.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on assisted ventilation, and his brainstem is affected, leading to agonal breathing.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has lost spinal reflexes, suggesting sympathetic output is lower at the brainstem or spinal level.
5. Hyperammonemia: The patient's ammonia level is unclear, but he has liver failure and pancreatic calcification of unknown etiology.
6. ESR: The patient's ESR was 0 in OSH, suggesting inflammatory causes of his presentation.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is likely sick euthyroid.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is high, which is concerning, but may be related to edema from anoxic brain injury and fluid shift.
9. Anasarca: The patient has liver failure, low albumin, and renal failure, leading to large fluid shifts and protein losses through skin.
10. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is lower than baseline, suggesting that we are keeping up with fluid requirements.
11. Liver failure: The cause of the patient's liver failure is unclear, but fatty changes are suggested by ultrasound.
12. Low ceruloplasmin: The patient's ceruloplasmin level is low, which may be related to liver failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to his compromised immune system and open skin wounds.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and assisted ventilation make him susceptible to pneumonia.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver failure may progress, leading to further complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
6. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may worsen, leading to further fluid shifts and protein losses through skin.
7. Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and open skin wounds make him susceptible to infections.

The plan for the patient includes:

1. Correcting sodium and rechecking ammonia levels.
2. Stopping sedation and analgesic medications.
3. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia/sepsis/C. diff.
4. Managing respiratory failure with assisted ventilation.
5. Monitoring and managing hypotension with fluid support and pressors.
6. Repeating ESR and ammonia levels.
7. Continuing nutrition and glycemic control.
8. Maintaining lines and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
9. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, pneumonia, and cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, encephalopathy, and diffuse skin sloughing.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple organ failures, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and septic shock. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and his mental status is poor with evidence of seizures.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* White Blood Cell Count: 11.9 K/uL
* Platelet Count: 60
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 16 mEq/L
* Sodium: 115 mEq/L
* Potassium: 143 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.5 mg/dL

The patient's skin is warm, but there is evidence of diffuse skin sloughing, particularly over dependent areas. He has a rash, which is described as desquamative, and is being managed with wound care.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer.

The patient's current medications include:

* Cefipime
* Metronidazole
* Vancomycin
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Fentanyl
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Dilantin

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue IV flagyl and po vanc
* Manage skin sloughing with wound care
* Monitor for sepsis and adjust antibiotics as needed
* Manage respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation
* Manage acute kidney injury with fluid restriction and electrolyte management
* Manage liver dysfunction with supportive care
* Manage septic shock with pressors as needed

The patient's prognosis is grim due to his multiple organ failures, hypoalbunemia, and poor neurologic function. The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting is planned to discuss goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), bladder cancer, and laryngeal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, renal failure, encephalopathy, and diffuse skin sloughing.

The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening respiratory failure, neurologic status, and skin integrity. He has been intubated for airway protection, and his mental status remains poor. The patient has also experienced seizures, which have been treated with Dilantin.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, and hypernatremia, which has now been corrected. He also has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 60, and hypoalbunemia, with an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include septic shock/hypotension, which has been managed with pressors, and C. difficile colitis, which is being treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.

The patient's prognosis is grim due to his multiple organ failures, poor neurologic function, and lack of a unifying diagnosis. The family has been informed of the patient's condition and has expressed their wish to transition his care to comfort measures only.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in his overall condition.
2. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's neurologic status may continue to decline, leading to further impairment of his cognitive and motor functions.
3. Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin integrity may continue to deteriorate, leading to further complications such as infections and sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infections: The patient is at risk for developing further infections, particularly given his compromised immune system and presence of C. difficile colitis.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, particularly given his compromised immune system and presence of C. difficile colitis.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status may deteriorate, leading to further complications such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and his prognosis is grim. Further management should focus on providing comfort measures only, and the family should be supported in their decision to transition the patient's care to comfort measures only."
