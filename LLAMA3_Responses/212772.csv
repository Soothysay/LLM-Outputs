   37 y/o with PMHx of ETOH pancreatitis s/p distal pancreatectomy and
   splenectomy now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with severe pancreatitis, elevated
   lactate & anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Pt with h/o severe pancreatitis c/b ARDS & requiring
   splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Pt presented with Ransons score
   of 1 but rising lactate and requiring aggressive IVF resussitation. Pt
   with new O2 requirement likely due to growing pleural effusions with
   some component of splinting due to pain.  Currently tachycardic &
   hypertensive, making adequate urine.  CT shows extensive inflammation,
   but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast. Will need repeat
   imagine after elective intubation to better assess for presence of
   necrosis.
   - Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR &/or Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u Surgery Recs, will need addl imaging CT vs MRI
CT Abdomen with
   contrast  -if necrotizing pancreatitis, surgical intervention.
   - add Imipenem if any e/o necrosis
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count & fever curve
   - Strict NPO & place OG tube to intermittent suction
   # Sedation: Patient is on proprofol, Midazolam, and fentanyl, with
   increasing requirements.  Will attempt to wean proprofol.  H/o DTs from
   etoh withdrawal. Patient is currently 24-48 hours since last drink.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) pancreatitis, who underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. He was transferred to the ICU with severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate and anion gap, and likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is tachycardic and hypertensive, with a rising lactate level. The patient's abdomen is tender, and he has a history of anaphylaxis to Topamax and Augmentin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's CT scan shows extensive inflammation, but it is unclear if there is necrosis. If necrotizing pancreatitis is present, surgical intervention may be necessary.
2. ETOH withdrawal syndrome: The patient is at risk for ETOH withdrawal syndrome, which can lead to severe symptoms such as seizures, hallucinations, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and anion gap may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Pancreatic abscess: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to the development of a pancreatic abscess, which can be a life-threatening complication.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's pancreatitis and ETOH withdrawal may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's hypertension may lead to a hypertensive crisis, which can cause severe complications such as cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, and kidney failure.
9. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and ventilator may increase his risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)."

   Assessment and Plan
   37 y/o with PMHx of ETOH pancreatitis s/p distal pancreatectomy and
   splenectomy now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with severe pancreatitis, elevated
   lactate & anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Pt with h/o severe pancreatitis c/b ARDS & requiring
   splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Pt presented with Ransons score
   of 1 but rising lactate and requiring aggressive IVF resussitation. Pt
   with new O2 requirement likely due to growing pleural effusions with
   some component of splinting due to pain.  Currently tachycardic &
   hypertensive, making adequate urine.  CT shows extensive inflammation,
   but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast. Will need repeat
   imagine after elective intubation to better assess for presence of
   necrosis.
   - Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR &/or Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u Surgery Recs, will need addl imaging CT vs MRI
CT Abdomen with
   contrast  -if necrotizing pancreatitis, surgical intervention.
   - add Imipenem if any e/o necrosis
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count & fever curve
   - Strict NPO & place OG tube to intermittent suction
   # Sedation: Patient is on proprofol, Midazolam, and fentanyl, with
   increasing requirements.  Will attempt to wean proprofol.  H/o DTs from
   etoh withdrawal. Patient is currently 24-48 hours since last drink.
   .
   # ETOH Withdrawal: Pt was being treated with Diazepam 5mg q2hr for CIWA
   scale, will transition to Fentanyl & Midazolam gtt once intubated
   - SW consult once extubated
   - Midazolam gtt for now, titrate to adequate sedation
   .
   # Asthma: Pt on mainly different inhalers, unclear baseline reactive
   airway disease or degree of medication compliance
   - albuterol & atrovent nebs after intubated
   - f/u ABGs
   .
   # Hypertension: likely due to ETOH withdrawal vs pain
   - hold anti-HTN, treat withdrawal & pain with fentanyl/versed gtt
   .
   # Chronic Pain: Pt will be NPO on fentanyl gtt while intubated
   - will need to restart chronic pain regimen including Methadone after
   wean from vent
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: holding Gemfibrozil given strict NPO
   .
   # FEN: NPO with OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes aggressively

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) pancreatitis, who underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate, and anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is also receiving sedation and analgesia for pain and anxiety.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 135 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 136/99 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 26.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 282 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 252 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L
* Amylase: 379 IU/L
* Lipase: 721 IU/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT abdomen with contrast: extensive inflammation, but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast
* WBC: 26.7
* Hct: 40.0
* Plt: 282
* Cr: 0.7
* TCO2: 20
* Glucose: 252
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.2/26.6/1.2, ALT/AST: 139/120, Alk Phos/T Bili: 91/2.5, Amylase/Lipase: 379/721, Lactic Acid: 2.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.8 g/dL, LDH: 1300 IU/L, Ca++: 7.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 1.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure due to pancreatitis and ETOH withdrawal
* Sepsis due to pancreatitis and ETOH withdrawal
* Hypertension due to ETOH withdrawal and pain
* Hyperglycemia due to pancreatitis and ETOH withdrawal
* Pancreatitis and ETOH withdrawal may lead to further complications such as ARDS, AKI, and sepsis.
* The patient's history of ETOH pancreatitis and distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy may increase the risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, and organ failure.

Plan:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ethanol pancreatitis, who underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. He was transferred to the ICU with severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate, and anion gap, likely complicated by ethanol withdrawal.

The patient's current condition is:

* Tachycardic and hypertensive
* Hypovolemic with a fluid balance deficit of 1,710 mL
* Respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation
* Elevated lactate and anion gap
* Extensive inflammation on CT scan, but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast
* New oxygen requirement likely due to growing pleural effusions with some component of splinting due to pain

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to pancreatitis and possible necrosis
* Respiratory failure due to ARDS and pleural effusions
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypovolemia and hypertension
* Neurological compromise due to ethanol withdrawal and potential hypoxia
* Gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction
* Renal failure due to hypovolemia and potential necrosis
* Infectious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections

The plan for the patient includes:

* Elective intubation to better assess for presence of necrosis
* Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR and/or Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
* Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt for sedation and pain management
* SW consult once extubated
* Monitoring of blood, urine cultures, and WBC count and fever curve
* Strict NPO and placement of OG tube to intermittent suction
* Repletion of lytes aggressively
* Aggressive IVF resussitation

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications due to his underlying condition and the need for mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with alcoholic pancreatitis, intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. He has a history of shellfish allergy, anaphylaxis to Topamax, and diarrhea from Augmentin. The patient has been receiving Propofol, Fentanyl, and Midazolam infusions for sedation, and his respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure of 136/99 mmHg, and SpO2 of 92%. The patient has a CVP of 24 mmHg and is receiving fluids at a rate of 4,326 mL over 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.6, hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL, platelet count of 282 K/uL, and blood urea nitrogen of 25 mEq/L. His liver function tests show increasing ALT and AST levels, and his pancreatic enzymes have decreased. His imaging studies reveal small lung volumes on chest X-ray, and his microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient remains acutely ill with pancreatitis and acute respiratory failure. His respiratory acidosis has improved with increased ventilator support, and his sedation requirements are high due to chronic medications and ethanol withdrawal. The plan is to continue bowel rest, supportive care, and serial liver function tests. Surgery will be considered once the patient's condition stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis may worsen if his ventilator settings are not adjusted properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pancreatitis and respiratory failure increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Ethanol withdrawal syndrome: The patient's high sedation requirements may indicate ethanol withdrawal, which can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and other complications.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's pancreatitis and liver dysfunction increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's increased blood urea nitrogen level and decreased creatinine clearance may indicate impending renal failure.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's pancreatitis and respiratory failure may lead to cardiovascular complications such as hypotension, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory and urinary catheters increase his risk of developing infections.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and his high caloric requirements may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
9. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's pancreatitis and liver dysfunction increase his risk of gastrointestinal perforation."
