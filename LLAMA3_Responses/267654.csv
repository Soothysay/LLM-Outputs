   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents
   from rehab with severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and
   abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal
   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT w/ possible pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**9-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   Calculated bicarb deficit is 200.
   -Will repeat with 3amps bicarb
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT.  Pain out of
   proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are concerned
   about ischemic bowel.  Given his fever and increasing leukocytosis and
   recent hospitalizationwe are also concerned for C. Diff although he
   reports normal stool yesterday and was not on antibiotics recently. It
   is also possible he has pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology. It
   appears that his abdominal imaging is unchanged from previous
   admission.
   -KUB
   -Start Empiric Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Send C. Diff cultures
   -check Amylase, Lipase, LFTs
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem.
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   -speak to his HCP about baseline mental status.
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.2  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents
   from rehab with severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and
   abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal
   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT w/ possible pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**9-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis:
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT.  Pain out of
   proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are concerned
   about ischemic bowel.  Given his fever and increasing leukocytosis and
   recent hospitalizationwe are also concerned for C. Diff although he
   reports normal stool yesterday and was not on antibiotics recently. It
   is also possible he has pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology. It
   appears that his abdominal imaging is unchanged from previous
   admission.
   -KUB
   -Start Empiric Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Send C. Diff cultures
   -check Amylase, Lipase, LFTs
   -Serial Abdominal exams
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem.
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.

   -speak to his HCP about baseline mental status.
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently ????
   likely due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypotensive TIA, who presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, pyelonephritis, and abdominal pain. He has been receiving treatment for his sepsis and pyelonephritis with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors. He has also been experiencing abdominal pain, which is out of proportion to his physical examination. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and creatinine level, indicating ongoing sepsis and acute kidney injury. He has also been experiencing non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely related to his sepsis and pyelonephritis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's ongoing sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Abdominal ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain and tender abdomen may indicate ischemia, which could lead to necrosis and perforation of the bowel.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient's recent hospitalization and antibiotics may have increased his risk of developing C. difficile infection, which could lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology: The patient's abdominal pain and imaging studies may indicate underlying pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis may worsen if left untreated, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if left untreated, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if left untreated, leading to further complications such as cardiac disease and stroke.
8. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen if left untreated, leading to further complications such as hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive treatment for sepsis and pyelonephritis, including antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors.
2. Monitor the patient's abdominal pain and tenderness closely, and consider further imaging studies to rule out underlying pathology.
3. Consider empiric treatment for C. difficile infection, and monitor the patient's stool output and abdominal pain closely.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including his white blood cell count, lactate level, and creatinine level, to assess the effectiveness of treatment and potential for further complications.
5. Consider further treatment for the patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, such as bicarbonate therapy or dialysis.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider further treatment for hypertension if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and consider further treatment for diabetes if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypotensive transient ischemic attack (TIA). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and pyelonephritis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 109 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.9 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 26.0%
* Platelet count: 140 K/μL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 40 mg/dL
* Sodium: 134 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
* Chloride: 114 mEq/L
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Glucose: 40 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement, and tone not assessed

The patient's diagnosis is as follows:

* Sepsis/pyelonephritis: The patient presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, bandemia, and positive urine culture and computed tomography (CT) consistent with pyelonephritis.
* Recent TIA/MS changes: The patient noted to be lethargic at rehabilitation and CNS vasculature sensitive to low blood pressures given recent TIA.

The patient's plan is as follows:

* Continue levophed infusion to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg
* Continue empiric antibiotics and IV fluids
* Monitor creatinine and adjust dosing of antibiotics and IV fluids accordingly
* Monitor lactate levels and adjust therapy as necessary
* Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust therapy as necessary
* Continue to monitor for signs of acute kidney injury and adjust therapy as necessary

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute kidney injury
* Lactic acidosis
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypertensive crisis
* Hyperkalemia
* Hyperphosphatemia
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Neurological deterioration

Based on the patient's condition, it is crucial to continue aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and pressors as necessary to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg and prevent hypotensive/hypoperfusion to the CNS. The patient's laboratory results and vital signs should be closely monitored, and therapy adjusted as necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   SEPSIS -- clinical presentation consistent with sepsis, possible
   urinary source.  Additional concerns include C. diff colitis, bowel
   ischemia, pancreatitis.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somewhat more obtunded compared to admission,
   but improved this AM during rounds.  Variable.  Suspect toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   HYPOTENSION -- suspect hypovolemia and sepsis.  Monitor BP, maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- new pain this AM.  Concerns include C. Diff, PUD,
   acute pancreatitis, and ischemic bowel.  Monitor serial exam, check
   stool for C. diff, guiac stools, amylase & lipase.  Consider empirical
   Flagyl.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect prerenal, although at risk for ATN.  Monitor
   urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   ACIDOSIS -- non-anion gap, likley from resussitation.  Use lactated
   ringer's judiciously in setting of acute renal failure.
   FLUIDS -- suspect hypovolemia.  Continue iv fluid boluses, monitor uo,
   BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus; may be due to hypotension, hypovolemia, pain or
   vasopressor effect.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely due to oral hypoglycemic agents in setting of
   NPO.
   ANEMIA -- ACD and iron deficiency by blood testing.  Transfuse to
   Hct>28.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is hypotension and altered mental status. The patient remains on vasopressors and has experienced hypoglycemia, which was treated with D50W. The patient is also complaining of abdominal pain, epigastric, associated with nausea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient's extremities are warm, and there is no cyanosis or clubbing. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count, with a count of 17.9 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 2.2 mg/dL, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 19 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment includes sepsis, altered mental status, hypotension, abdominal pain, renal failure, acidosis, and anemia. The patient's plan includes monitoring for sepsis, treating altered mental status, managing hypotension, investigating abdominal pain, managing renal failure, and addressing acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure can progress, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and end-stage renal disease.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal pain and distension can worsen, leading to abdominal compartment syndrome, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's abdominal pain can be a sign of pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic necrosis and sepsis.
5. C. difficile colitis: The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea can be a sign of C. difficile colitis, which can lead to severe colitis and sepsis.
6. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status can worsen, leading to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, which can cause seizures, coma, and death.
7. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia can worsen, leading to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and failure.
8. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis can worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis
   SEPSIS -- clinical presentation consistent with sepsis, possible
   urinary source.  Additional concerns include C. diff colitis, bowel
   ischemia, pancreatitis.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- somewhat more obtunded compared to admission,
   but improved this AM during rounds.  Variable.  Suspect toxic-metabolic
   encephalopathy.
   HYPOTENSION -- suspect hypovolemia and sepsis.  Monitor BP, maintain
   MAP >60 mmHg.
   ABDOMINAL PAIN -- new pain this AM.  Concerns include C. Diff, PUD,
   acute pancreatitis, and ischemic bowel.  Monitor serial exam, check
   stool for C. diff, guiac stools, amylase & lipase.  Consider empirical
   Flagyl.
   RENAL FAILURE -- suspect prerenal, although at risk for ATN.  Monitor
   urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   ACIDOSIS -- non-anion gap, likley from resussitation.  Use lactated
   ringer's judiciously in setting of acute renal failure.
   FLUIDS -- suspect hypovolemia.  Continue iv fluid boluses, monitor uo,
   BUN, creatinine.
   TACHYCARDIA -- sinus; may be due to hypotension, hypovolemia, pain or
   vasopressor effect.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely due to oral hypoglycemic agents in setting of
   NPO.
   ANEMIA -- ACD and iron deficiency by blood testing.  Transfuse to
   Hct>28.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and hypoglycemia. The patient's medical history is significant for sepsis, likely due to a urinary source, and concerns for C. diff colitis, bowel ischemia, and pancreatitis. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with some improvement during rounds, and is suspected to be related to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 97/49 mmHg and a heart rate of 109 bpm. The patient has been receiving various medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and insulin, and has undergone several interventions, including fluid boluses and blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and altered mental status may be indicative of C. diff colitis, a potentially life-threatening infection.
3. Bowel ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain and altered mental status may also be related to bowel ischemia, which can lead to perforation and peritonitis.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's abdominal pain and altered mental status may also be related to pancreatitis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest potential renal failure, which can be exacerbated by sepsis and hypovolemia.
6. Acidosis: The patient's non-anion gap acidosis may be related to resuscitation and can lead to further organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to hypovolemia, sepsis, or vasopressor effect, and can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not promptly treated.
8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to hypotension, hypovolemia, pain, or vasopressor effect, and can lead to further cardiac complications if not promptly treated.
9. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia may be related to oral hypoglycemic agents and can lead to further complications if not promptly treated.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to ACD and iron deficiency, and can lead to further complications if not promptly treated."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis/Pyelonephritis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal
   failure, bandemia, positive UA and CT w/ possible pyelonephritis.  SBP
   responded to 4L IVF with CVP of 12 and SVO2 in 70-80s.  However, MAPs
   continue to be marginal and pts baseline is hypertensive.  Lactate
   remained elevated at 2.8 after fluid resuscitation.  A-line intact.
   - Continue LR boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**9-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Levophed gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for empiric coverage of UTI/Pyelo. (no history of
   ESBL)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures (narrow Abx when avail)
   - check AM/PM ABG/lactate
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   Calculated bicarb deficit is 200.
   -Will repeat with 3amps bicarb
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT.  Pain out of
   proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are concerned
   about ischemic bowel.  Given his fever and increasing leukocytosis and
   recent hospitalizationwe are also concerned for C. Diff although he
   reports normal stool yesterday and was not on antibiotics recently. It
   is also possible he has pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology. It
   appears that his abdominal imaging is unchanged from previous
   admission.
   -KUB
   -Start Empiric Flagyl for C. Diff
   -Send C. Diff cultures
   -check Amylase, Lipase, LFTs
   -Serial Abdominal exams

   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   -speak to his HCP about baseline mental status.
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.2  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, pyelonephritis, and abdominal pain. He is currently receiving Norepinephrine and Phenylephrine infusions to maintain his blood pressure and is being treated with antibiotics for UTI/pyelonephritis. He has a history of TIA and is at risk for ischemic bowel. His labs show elevated lactate levels, and he has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. He is also being treated for possible C. difficile infection and has a dilated colon on CXR and CT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic bowel: Given the patient's recent TIA and history of hypertension, there is a risk of ischemic bowel due to decreased blood flow to the intestines.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is at risk for C. difficile infection due to his recent hospitalization and antibiotic use.
3. Pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology: The patient's abdominal pain and imaging studies suggest the possibility of pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology.
4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate levels are elevated, and he has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may be due to his sepsis and underlying infection.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he may be at risk for anemia due to his underlying disease and blood loss.
6. Renal failure: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently experiencing acute renal failure, which may be due to his sepsis and hypovolemia.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes and is at risk for hyperglycemia due to his underlying disease and potential stress from his sepsis.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently low, and he is at risk for hypertension due to his underlying disease and potential side effects of his medications.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is at risk for hyperlipidemia due to his underlying disease and potential side effects of his medications.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk for malnutrition due to his underlying disease and potential side effects of his medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain the patient's blood pressure and organ perfusion.
2. Monitor the patient's lactate levels and adjust his treatment accordingly.
3. Consider adding C. difficile treatment to the patient's antibiotic regimen.
4. Monitor the patient's abdominal pain and imaging studies to rule out pancreatic or liver/biliary pathology.
5. Consider adding iron repletion to the patient's treatment regimen.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his treatment accordingly.
7. Consider adding hyperglycemia treatment to the patient's treatment regimen.
8. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his treatment accordingly.
9. Consider adding hyperlipidemia treatment to the patient's treatment regimen.
10. Monitor the patient's nutrition and consider adding nutritional support to his treatment regimen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with ongoing sepsis, hypotension, and abdominal pain. They have been treated with vasopressors and have a history of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their hemodynamic monitoring indicates ongoing hypovolemia and sepsis. The patient has abnormal liver function tests, and a RUQ ultrasound suggests distention of the gallbladder and upper limit of the bile duct distention. The patient is NPO pending evaluation, and their nutritional support is being managed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis could lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs, including the kidneys, brain, and heart.
3. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and distended gallbladder could lead to further complications, including perforation, abscess formation, or bowel obstruction.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests could indicate ongoing liver damage or failure, which could lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's gradual reduction in Hct could lead to further anemia, which could exacerbate their hypotension and cardiovascular instability.
6. NIDDM: The patient's diabetes could lead to further complications, including hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and nephropathy.
7. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's ongoing hypovolemia could lead to further fluid imbalance, including dehydration or fluid overload.

Recommendations:

1. Continue supportive care, including vasopressors and antibiotics, to manage the patient's sepsis and hypotension.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely to ensure adequate perfusion of vital organs.
3. Consider further imaging studies, such as a HIDA scan, to evaluate the patient's abdominal pain and distended gallbladder.
4. Manage the patient's nutritional support, including providing parenteral nutrition if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and anemia, and consider transfusing blood products if necessary.
6. Manage the patient's diabetes, including maintaining glucose levels below 140.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely to prevent dehydration or fluid overload."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of hypotension. They have been in the ICU for several days and have undergone various tests and treatments. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 89/48 mmHg and a heart rate of 77 bpm. They have a history of sepsis, intra-abdominal or urinary source, and are being treated with supportive care. The patient has also been experiencing abdominal pain, which is a concern for bowel ischemia. They have undergone several imaging studies, including an ultrasound and CT scan, which have revealed distention of the gallbladder and upper limit of bile duct distention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent sepsis is a significant concern, as it can lead to organ dysfunction and death. The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and abnormal laboratory results (e.g., elevated white blood cell count, lactate level) are consistent with sepsis.
2. Bowel Ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain and distended gallbladder are concerns for bowel ischemia. If left untreated, bowel ischemia can lead to necrosis and perforation, which can be life-threatening.
3. Shock Liver: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) suggest the possibility of shock liver. This is a condition in which the liver becomes damaged due to inadequate blood flow, which can lead to liver failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's gradual reduction in hemoglobin level (Hct) is a concern, as it can lead to anemia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension and abnormal laboratory results (e.g., elevated lactate level, decreased central venous pressure) suggest hypovolemia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
6. DVT: The patient's immobility and history of sepsis make them at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If left untreated, DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
7. VAP: The patient's history of sepsis and intubation make them at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is a serious complication that can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
8. NIDDM: The patient's history of diabetes and abnormal glucose levels (e.g., hyperglycemia) make them at risk for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). NIDDM can lead to complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with a complex medical condition. They require close monitoring and treatment of their sepsis, bowel ischemia, shock liver, anemia, hypovolemia, DVT, VAP, and NIDDM."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown. He had
   positive UA and CT peri-nephric stranding, but also a history of
   multiple SBO and dilated loops of bowel on KUB.  Urine Cx with E.coli
   but not improving on Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl.
   - Continue IV  boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**11-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u blood Cx
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl for now
   - Start Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.5  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.
   -Transfuse for HVT<25
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   - has type & cross
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - Humalog sliding scale coverage
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given altered mental status
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and abdominal pain. He has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids, but his condition remains unstable. He has a history of multiple small bowel obstructions and dilated loops of bowel on KUB, which may be contributing to his abdominal pain. He also has a history of TIA and is at risk for ischemic bowel.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic bowel: The patient's abdominal pain may be due to ischemic bowel, which is a life-threatening complication of severe sepsis.
2. Sepsis-induced organ failure: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ failure, including renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiac failure.
3. Infection: The patient's infection may not be responding to antibiotics, which may lead to further complications, such as septic shock and death.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be contributing to his abdominal pain and may require further management.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may be contributing to his cardiovascular risk and may require further management.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to his fatigue and may require further management.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may be contributing to his poor wound healing and may require further management.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable and requires close monitoring. He requires further management of his sepsis, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids. He also requires further management of his abdominal pain, including imaging studies and surgical consultation. He requires further management of his hypertension, including medication adjustment and close monitoring. He requires further management of his hyperlipidemia, including medication adjustment and close monitoring. He requires further management of his anemia, including transfusion and iron supplementation. He requires further management of his malnutrition, including nutrition support and close monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown. He had
   positive UA and CT peri-nephric stranding, but also a history of
   multiple SBO and dilated loops of bowel on KUB.  Urine Cx with E.coli
   but not improving on Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl.
   - Continue IV  boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**11-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u blood Cx
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl for now
   - Start Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.5  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.  Given septic picture, we will transfuse to higher
   goal

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypotensive transient ischemic attack (TIA) who presented from rehabilitation with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and bandemia. The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and blood products.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 117/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, and the patient is receiving norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 65 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, bands, and lactate, indicating ongoing sepsis. The patient's liver function tests are trending down, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure.

The patient's abdominal pain is out of proportion to his physical examination, and a computed tomography (CT) scan shows dilated loops of bowel and peri-nephric stranding. The patient is receiving treatment for possible ischemic bowel and Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with a recent TIA and altered mental status. The patient is not oriented to time and place, and his neurologic examination is non-focal. The patient's recent medical history includes a baseline multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, which may be contributing to his current neurological status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
2. Ischemic bowel disease, leading to bowel perforation or necrosis.
3. C. diff infection, leading to colitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Neurological deterioration, including worsening MS symptoms or development of new neurological deficits.
5. Anemia, potentially requiring transfusions and iron repletion.
6. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, potentially requiring treatment with bicarbonate or other agents.
7. Hypertension, potentially requiring treatment with antihypertensive medications.
8. Hyperlipidemia, potentially requiring treatment with statins or other lipid-lowering agents.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple potential complications, close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown. He had
   positive UA and CT peri-nephric stranding, but also a history of
   multiple SBO and dilated loops of bowel on KUB.  Urine Cx with E.coli
   but not improving on Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl.
   - Continue IV  boluses to maintain CVP goal of >[**11-25**].  We will try to
   keep his CVP at the higher end because his ECHO shows borderline
   pulmonary hypertension so he probably has elevated CVP at baseline.
   - Continue Neo gtt to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u blood Cx
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/flagyl for now
   - Start Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.5  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.  Given septic picture, we will transfuse to higher
   goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   - has type & cross

   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - Humalog sliding scale coverage
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypotensive TIA, who presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and abdominal pain. He has been receiving IV boluses to maintain CVP, neogtt to maintain MAP, and transfusions to keep Hct >28. He has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, and meropenem, and has been started on flagyl for possible C. difficile. He has also been treated with morphine for pain and has been given Zofran for nausea.

The patient's labs show evidence of sepsis, including a positive UA and CT peri-nephric stranding, and a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of bowel on KUB. His ECHO shows borderline pulmonary hypertension, and his LFTs are correcting quickly, suggesting shock liver.

The patient's abdominal pain is out of proportion to his exam, and he has been started on a CT with oral contrast to rule out SBO. He has also been started on flagyl for possible C. difficile, and his LFTs will be monitored.

The patient's recent TIA has raised concerns about ischemic bowel, and he has been started on a regimen of Zofran and morphine for pain.

The patient's anemia is likely due to hemodilution, and he will be transfused to keep his Hct >28. His iron levels are low, and he will be repleted when stable and taking PO.

The patient's DM is being held, and he will be monitored for BS QIDACHS. His hypertension is currently hypotensive, and he will be continued on Aspirin 81mg. His hyperlipidemia is being treated with Atorvastatin 10mg daily.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe, and he may continue to deteriorate if not properly treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is 2.5, and he may require further treatment to maintain kidney function.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to hemodilution, and he may require further transfusions to keep his Hct >28.
4. Ischemic Bowel: The patient's recent TIA has raised concerns about ischemic bowel, and he may require further treatment to prevent further damage.
5. C. difficile: The patient has been started on flagyl for possible C. difficile, and he may require further treatment if the infection persists.
6. Shock Liver: The patient's LFTs are correcting quickly, suggesting shock liver, and he may require further treatment to prevent further damage.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently hypotensive, and he may require further treatment to maintain blood pressure.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being treated with Atorvastatin 10mg daily, and he may require further treatment to maintain lipid levels.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV boluses to maintain CVP.
2. Continue neogtt to maintain MAP.
3. Continue transfusions to keep Hct >28.
4. Monitor LFTs and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
6. Monitor creatinine and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor anemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of ischemic bowel and adjust treatment as necessary.
9. Monitor for signs of C. difficile and adjust treatment as necessary.
10. Monitor for signs of shock liver and adjust treatment as necessary.
11. Monitor blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
12. Monitor lipid levels and adjust treatment as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - ABG in PM to trend lactate.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now,
   - D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl for now
   -serial LFTs
   -Zofran for nausea
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required 3 amps D50 overnight.  Likely
   combination of poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with
   new renal/hepatic injury, and pt being NPO.
   -Switch IVF to D5
   - consider TF when abdomen is decompressed and patient with regular BM.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # MS changes: Patient lethargic after morphine yesterday.  Also with
   low Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS.
   - Hold sedatives for now
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   - Add D5 to IVF to prevent further Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Atorvastatin 10mg daily given poor PO with
   altered MS
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn
   .
   # Access: Subclavian CVL, PIV
   .
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypotensive TIA, admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and abdominal pain.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/40 mmHg.
* The patient's laboratory results show:
	+ WBC: 24.2
	+ Hct: 25.1%
	+ Plt: 147
	+ Cr: 2.7 mg/dL
	+ TCO2: 21
	+ Glucose: 34 mg/dL
	+ Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
	+ Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
	+ LDH: 269 IU/L
	+ Ca++: 6.6 mg/dL
	+ Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
	+ PO4: 4.4 mg/dL
* The patient's physical examination reveals:
	+ Genital: normal
	+ Cardiovascular: regular rhythm, no murmurs or gallops
	+ Pulmonary: bibasilar crackles, diffuse end expiratory wheezes
	+ Abdominal: soft but more distended, tenderness worse at epigastrum
	+ Extremities: trace edema at the ankles
* The patient's medical conditions include:
	+ Sepsis: likely due to urosepsis with ESBL, with positive urine culture and CT peri-nephric stranding
	+ Abdominal pain: likely due to dilated colon and possible ischemic bowel
	+ Hypoglycemia: likely due to poor clearance of glyburide and new renal/hepatic injury
	+ Anemia: likely due to hemodilution and iron deficiency
	+ Acute renal failure: likely due to ATN
	+ Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: likely due to NS resuscitation and underlying infection
* The patient's plan of care includes:
	+ Continue to monitor vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination
	+ Continue empiric antibiotics and IV fluids
	+ Monitor creatinine and adjust IV fluids accordingly
	+ Monitor urine output and replete iron when stable
	+ Continue to monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed
	+ Hold sedatives and monitor neurologic status
	+ Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotics as needed
	+ Monitor for signs of bleeding and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Development of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia
* Anemia or bleeding
* Respiratory failure or pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction
* Neurological complications such as seizures or stroke
* Sepsis-induced coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation
* Development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or fungal infections
* Development of pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers
* Development of pneumonia or other respiratory infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now, D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is normal.
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged hypotension likely due to ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.  Given septic picture, we will transfuse to higher
   goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn
   .
   # Access: Subclavian CVL, PIV
   .
   # PPx: Heparin sc TID, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI (lines & pressors okay)
   .
   # Dispo: ICU pending improvement in MS
   .
   # Comm:  with patient and HCP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension, who presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and abdominal pain. He has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, anemia, and abnormal liver function tests. He has also had a recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) and is at risk for ischemic bowel disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic bowel disease: The patient's abdominal pain is out of proportion to his physical examination, and his recent TIA increases his risk for ischemic bowel disease. He may require further evaluation with a CT scan with oral contrast to rule out small bowel obstruction.
2. Sepsis-related acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.1 to 2.7, and he is at risk for further kidney damage due to prolonged hypotension and sepsis.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis may be secondary to his underlying infection, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause of his acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to hemodilution and iron deficiency, and he may require further transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level of 28.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels have been elevated, and he may require further treatment with insulin to control his blood sugar levels.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and he may require further treatment with antihypertensive medications to control his blood pressure.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he may require further evaluation to determine the cause of his liver dysfunction.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's recent TIA increases his risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
9. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to further complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now, D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl
   -serial LFTs
   - OSH records to determine chronicity of this problem
   -Zofran and morphine for pain
   .
   # Recent TIA/MS changes: Pt noted to be lethargic at rehab and CNS
   vasculatur sensitive to low BPs given TIA [**3-17**] hypotension during recent
   admission. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 133**] continue with aggressive IVF
   resuscitation & pressors prn to avoid hypotensive/hypoperfusion to
   CNS.  Will d/w HCP in am regarding recent baseline MS.
   - Baseline hypertension, so will continue levophed gtt to maintain
   MAP>65 and will increase for mental status decline
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection,  lactate is decreasing.
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.5  likely
   due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue Levo gtt to maintain MAP>65 to maintain kidney perfusion
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-29 range, currently  and
   normocytic after agressive resuscitation with NS and LR.   Most likely
   hemodilution.  Iron low with normal [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and
   chronic disease.  Given septic picture, we will transfuse to higher
   goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   - has type & cross
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - Humalog sliding scale coverage
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: NG tube placed for Oral contrast.  Will give meds and consider
   TF tomorrow
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Ischemic bowel: The patient's abdominal pain is out of proportion to the examination, and there is a concern about ischemic bowel due to recent TIA and history of multiple SBO. The patient is being monitored for signs of bowel ischemia.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still septic, and the source of infection is unknown. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, and the E. coli sensitivity is being monitored.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for further kidney damage due to sepsis and relative hypovolemia/hypotension.
4. Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to NS resuscitation and underlying infection.
5. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic anemia likely due to hemodilution from aggressive resuscitation with NS and LR. The patient's iron level is low, and iron deficiency and chronic disease are suspected.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes, and their blood sugars have dipped to the 20-30s overnight. The patient is being monitored for hyperglycemia and is receiving Humalog sliding scale coverage.
7. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypotensive, and their blood pressure is being monitored. The patient's hypertension is being managed with Aspirin 81mg daily.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated for hyperlipidemia with Atorvastatin 10mg daily.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition support through an NG tube and is at risk for nutritional deficiencies.
10. Catheter-related complications: The patient has a subclavian CVL and PIV, and is at risk for catheter-related complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's overall condition is complex, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. They have undergone various diagnostic tests and treatments, including a HIDA scan, CT scan, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/56 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a central venous catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, normalizing, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) resolving. They have thrombocytopenia, which may be attributed to consumption, bone marrow suppression, or medication-related causes. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but they are more distended and require decompression with a nasogastric tube and intermittent suction.

The patient's medication list includes antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications to manage their condition. They are receiving D5W and have a central line in place for fluid administration. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully resolved, and they may continue to experience symptoms such as fever, chills, and increased white blood cell count.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not managed with platelet transfusions or other interventions.
4. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal distension and pain may worsen if not managed with decompression and other interventions.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may worsen if not managed with calcium supplementation and monitoring.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia may worsen if not managed with glucose supplementation and monitoring.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if not managed with oxygen therapy and other interventions.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen if not managed with vasopressors and other interventions.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and they require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Imaging: ABD CT -- no acute pathology; IVC filter in place
   HIDA Scan negative for acute cholecystitis
   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, urinary source.
   SEPSIS -- slow improvement, but now off vasopressors.  WBC
   normalizing.  Continue support.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  No evidence for
   cortisol insufficiency.  No evidence MI.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.
   Continue to monitor UO, BUN, creat.  Monitor for diuresis.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- resolving;  attributed to shock liver.  Monitor
   serial.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA --  may be consumption (but no evidence for active
   bleeding), may be bone marrow suppression, may be medication related
   (ex heparin).  Monitor.
   ABD PAIN -- somewhat improved, but more distended --> decompress with
   NGT, intermittent suction.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- total body depleted.  continue to replete, monitor
   ionized ca++
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- accounts for lethargy in part;  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to
   slow clearance of oral hypoglycemia in combination with NPO.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   ascribed to antibiotic.  Continue to monitor glucose, hold hypoglycemic
   agents.  Provide D5W if remains NPO.
   NUTRITION -- hope to initiate TF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, urinary source.
   SEPSIS -- slow improvement, but now off vasopressors.  WBC
   normalizing.  Continue support.  Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis.  No evidence for
   cortisol insufficiency.  No evidence MI.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia.
   Continue to monitor UO, BUN, creat.  Monitor for diuresis.
   ABNORMAL LFTs -- resolving;  attributed to shock liver.  Monitor
   serial.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA --  may be consumption (but no evidence for active
   bleeding), may be bone marrow suppression, may be medication related
   (ex heparin).  Monitor.
   ABD PAIN -- somewhat improved, but more distended --> decompress with
   NGT, intermittent suction.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- total body depleted.  continue to replete, monitor
   ionized ca++
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- accounts for lethargy in part;  [**Month (only) 51**] be attributed to
   slow clearance of oral hypoglycemia in combination with NPO.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   ascribed to antibiotic.  Continue to monitor glucose, hold hypoglycemic
   agents.  Provide D5W if remains NPO.
   NUTRITION -- hope to initiate TF.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - ABG in PM to trend lactate.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now,
   - D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl for now
   -serial LFTs
   -Zofran for nausea
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required 3 amps D50 overnight.  Likely
   combination of poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with
   new renal/hepatic injury, and pt being NPO.
   -Switch IVF to D5
   - consider TF when abdomen is decompressed and patient with regular BM.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # MS changes: Patient lethargic after morphine yesterday.  Also with
   low Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS.
   - Hold sedatives for now
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   - Add D5 to IVF to prevent further Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Atorvastatin 10mg daily given poor PO with
   altered MS
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia
   - adv diabetic diet when more alert
   - monitor lytes/replete prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - ABG in PM to trend lactate.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now,
   - D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl for now
   -serial LFTs
   -Zofran for nausea
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required 3 amps D50 overnight.  Likely
   combination of poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with
   new renal/hepatic injury, and pt being NPO.
   -Switch IVF to D5
   - consider TF when abdomen is decompressed and patient with regular BM.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # MS changes: Patient lethargic after morphine yesterday.  Also with
   low Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS.
   - Hold sedatives for now
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   - Add D5 to IVF to prevent further Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypotensive transient ischemic attack (TIA) who presents to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).
* The patient has a positive urine culture with E. coli and is receiving vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.
* The patient has a history of multiple small bowel obstructions (SBOs) and dilated loops of bowel on computed tomography (CT) scan, which may be contributing to his abdominal pain.
* The patient has a low hemoglobin level (78 g/L) and is receiving packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 28%.
* The patient has a normal blood glucose level (121 mg/dL) but required three ampules of D50 overnight due to hypoglycemia.
* The patient has a normal electrolyte level, but his lactate level is normal, and he has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
* The patient has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is receiving aggressive intravenous fluid therapy.
* The patient has a history of iron deficiency and chronic disease, and is receiving iron supplementation.
* The patient has a history of hypertension, but is currently hypotensive, and is not receiving any blood pressure medications.
* The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, but is not receiving any lipid-lowering medications.
* The patient has a nasogastric (NG) tube for suction and is receiving D5 NS for hypoglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
* Abdominal compartment syndrome due to the patient's history of SBOs and dilated loops of bowel.
* Ischemic bowel disease due to the patient's recent TIA and abdominal pain.
* Hypoglycemia due to the patient's history of diabetes and altered mental status.
* Anemia due to the patient's low hemoglobin level and history of iron deficiency.
* Hyperglycemia due to the patient's history of diabetes and altered mental status.
* Electrolyte imbalance due to the patient's history of chronic disease and altered mental status.
* Renal failure due to the patient's history of ATN and acute kidney injury.
* Liver dysfunction due to the patient's history of liver disease and altered mental status.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and altered mental status.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is still currently unknown but may be
   urosepsis with ESBL.  He had  positive UA and CT peri-nephric
   stranding, but also a history of multiple SBO and dilated loops of
   bowel on CT.  Urine Cx with E.coli, now improving on
   Vanc/Zosyn/flaygyl/[**Last Name (un) **].
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise
   maintanence fluids.
   - f/u E. Coli sensitivities
   - Transfuse 1 U PRBC to keep Hct >28.
   - ABG in PM to trend lactate.
   - Continue Zosyn/flagyl/[**Last Name (un) **] for now,
   - D/C vanc
   - Continue Meropenum for possibility of ESBL
   #Abdominal Pain: Dilated colon on CXR and in Abd CT w/o contrast.  Pain
   out of proportion to exam this morning.  Given his recent TIA we are
   concerned about ischemic bowel.  Flagyl started for ? of C diff though
   probability low. It is also possible he has liver/biliary pathology
   although LFTs are correcting quickly suggesting shock liver.
   -CT with Oral Contrast for ? of SBO
   -F/u C diff. Cont flagyl for now
   -serial LFTs
   -Zofran for nausea
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required 3 amps D50 overnight.  Likely
   combination of poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with
   new renal/hepatic injury, and pt being NPO.
   -Switch IVF to D5
   - consider TF when abdomen is decompressed and patient with regular BM.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # MS changes: Patient lethargic after morphine yesterday.  Also with
   low Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.
   Most likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute
   infection vs. baseline MS.
   - Hold sedatives for now
   - q4h neuro exams
   - treat infection: continue empiric Abx & IVF
   - Add D5 to IVF to prevent further Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.7.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine with aggressive IVF
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold Atorvastatin 10mg daily given poor PO with
   altered MS
   .
   # FEN: NG tube to suction.  Will give D5
 NS for hypoglycemia

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hypotensive TIA. He presented to the hospital with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and bandemia. The source of sepsis is still unknown, but it is suspected to be urosepsis with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli. The patient has received antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 102/38 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung examination, soft abdomen with improved distension, and a blood blister on his left big toe. His mental status is improved, and he is interactive and following commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and bandemia, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.7 mg/dL, and his lactate level is normal. His liver function tests are improving, and his troponin level is elevated.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis.
2. Transfusing packed red blood cells to maintain a hemoglobin level above 28%.
3. Monitoring blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin therapy as needed.
4. Managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
5. Monitoring for signs of ischemic bowel disease and considering a CT scan with oral contrast.
6. Continuing to monitor the patient's mental status and adjusting sedation and pain management as needed.
7. Monitoring for signs of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and adjusting fluid management accordingly.
8. Managing the patient's anemia and considering transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin level above 28%.
9. Monitoring for signs of acute kidney injury and adjusting fluid management accordingly.
10. Continuing to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjusting therapy as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Ischemic bowel disease, which can lead to bowel perforation, peritonitis, or sepsis.
3. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can lead to worsening of the patient's underlying medical conditions.
4. Acute kidney injury, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which can lead to worsening of the patient's underlying medical conditions.
6. Hypertension, which can lead to worsening of the patient's underlying medical conditions.
7. Hyperlipidemia, which can lead to worsening of the patient's underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he remains at risk for developing further complications. Close monitoring and adjustments to his therapy are necessary to prevent or manage these complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o M with PMHx of DM & hypotensive TIA presents from rehab with
   severe sepsis, (hypotension and UTI/pyelonephritis) and abdominal pain.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented with hypotension, acute renal failure, elevated
   LFT
s and bandemia.   Source is likely urosepsis with E. Coli.  Urine
   Cx with E.coli, sensitive to Meropenem and ceftriaxone and others (see
   [**Last Name (un) 270**] in OMR).
   - Continue to monitor BP, if decreased can bolus but otherwise minimize
   fluids.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) **] for now
   - D/C vanc, zosyn, flagyl
   #Abdominal Pain: Much improved today with decompression and BM x 2
   yesterday.  C diff negative.
   - D/C flagyl
   - continue bowel regimen
   - continue [**Last Name (un) **] for 1 more day then consider switching to ceftriaxone
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with platlets continuing to trend down now
   78
   - D/C all heparin exposure (SQ, Flushes)
   - CBC this PM
   - Send HIT antibody.
   .
   #. Hypoglycemia: Patient required D10 overnight.  Likely combination of
   poor clearance of glyburide given prior to admit with new renal/hepatic
   injury, and pt being NPO.
   - Continue D10
 NS and titrate to normal BG
   - Advance to diabetic diet as tolerated.
   - D/C ISS
   .
   # ARF: Pt with recent baseline creatinine of 1.1, currently 2.9.  Given
   prolonged turnaround of renal function in setting of  hypotension ->
   likely ATN
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose ABx, hold nephrotoxins
   - continue to monitor UOP to keep >30 cc/hr
   - Diurese today given crackles on Lung exam
   .
   # MS changes: Patient much improved from yesterday.  Also with low
   Glucose. Neuro exam non-focal but pt not oriented to time/place.  Most
   likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in setting of acute infection vs.
   baseline MS.
   - treat infection: continue Abx
   - continue to monitor for Hypoglycemia.
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be in 26-28 range.   Most likely
   hemodilution but pt with acute 3 pt drop this AM.  Iron low with normal
   [**Last Name (LF) 1271**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely iron deficiency and chronic disease.  Given septic
   picture, we will transfuse to higher goal
   -Transfuse for HCT<28
   -replete iron when stable and taking PO
   -q12 Hct
   - guaic all stools
   .
   # Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to NS
   resuscitation, plus underlying infection, lactate is normal.
   - continue to monitor
   # DM: Holding oral hypoglycemics, monitor BS QIDACHS
   - D/C Humalog sliding scale coverage given Hypoglycemia
   .
   # Hypertension: currently hypotensive
   - holding all BP meds for now
   - continue Aspirin 81mg
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue Atorvastatin 10mg daily
   .
   # FEN: D/C NG tube.  Will give D10
 NS for hypoglycemia and titrate as
   appropriate
   - adv diabetic diet as tolerated
   - monitor lytes/replete prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes and hypotensive TIA who presented to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and bandemia. The source of sepsis is likely urosepsis with E. coli. The patient's condition has improved with decompression and bowel movements, but he still has several potential medical complications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of progression to septic shock.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 2.9, indicating significant renal impairment. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, and the patient may require dialysis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 78, which is below the normal range. There is a risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of sepsis and ARF.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient required D10 overnight and may continue to experience hypoglycemia due to poor clearance of glyburide and new renal/hepatic injury.
5. Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, and there is a risk of further deterioration in the setting of sepsis and ARF.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, indicating significant anemia. There is a risk of further deterioration in the setting of ongoing bleeding and sepsis.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently hypotensive, and there is a risk of further hypotension, particularly in the setting of sepsis and ARF.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid profile is abnormal, and there is a risk of further deterioration in the setting of sepsis and ARF.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and medical treatment. The patient will require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, urinary source; acute renal failure.
   SEPSIS -- good response to current therapy.  Monitor VS.
   HYPTENSION -- hypovolemia, sepsis.  Resoved.  Maintin BP MAP > 60 mmHg
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- progressive, non-oliguric.  Creatinine continues
   to increase.  Intravascular replete.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  D10W for glucose control.
   FLUIDS -- remains volume expanded.  Desire net negative.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely attributed to slow clearance of oral
   hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name **] in setting of renal failure.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- resolving; likely shock liver.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- marked decrease.  Likely drug-related.  check HIT
   antibody.
   ABD PAIN -- likely related to hepatic inflammation, possible related to
   sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is critically ill with sepsis, acute renal failure, and hypotension.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/48 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors to manage sepsis and hypotension.
* The patient's creatinine level is increasing, indicating progressive acute renal failure.
* The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an active infection.
* The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely related to drug-induced effects.
* The patient has abdominal pain, likely related to hepatic inflammation or sepsis.
* The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, likely due to shock liver.
* The patient's blood glucose levels are controlled with IV fluids and insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of acute renal failure, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy.
* Development of multi-organ failure, including liver and cardiovascular failure.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
* Worsening of sepsis, leading to septic shock.
* Development of respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
* Increased risk of nosocomial infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).
* Potential for further liver damage or failure due to ongoing sepsis and hypotension.
* Risk of hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy and potential for glucose fluctuations.
* Potential for further abdominal pain and discomfort due to ongoing inflammation and sepsis.

Based on this assessment, I recommend continued close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted as necessary to address any complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's condition has been managed with antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and an arterial blood gas showing a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 41 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen of 115 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 26.6 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 166 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase level of 50 IU/L. The patient's complete blood count shows a marked decrease in platelet count, with a level of 78 K/uL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen despite current therapy, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level continues to increase, indicating worsening kidney function.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, which may indicate liver dysfunction or failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is low, which may be attributed to slow clearance of oral hypoglycemic medication in the setting of renal failure.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, which may increase the risk of fluid overload and cardiovascular complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but may worsen if respiratory support is not adequate.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to hepatic inflammation or sepsis, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or altered mental status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, urinary source; acute renal failure.
   SEPSIS -- good response to current therapy.  Monitor VS.
   HYPTENSION -- hypovolemia, sepsis.  Resoved.  Maintin BP MAP > 60 mmHg
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- progressive, non-oliguric.  Creatinine continues
   to increase.  Intravascular replete.  Monitor uo, BUN, creatinine.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  D10W for glucose control.
   FLUIDS -- remains volume expanded.  Desire net negative.  Monitor I/O.
   HYPOGLYCEMIA -- likely attributed to slow clearance of oral
   hypoglycemic [**Doctor Last Name **] in setting of renal failure.
   LFT ABNORMALITIES -- resolving; likely shock liver.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- marked decrease.  Likely drug-related.  check HIT

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis, acute renal failure, and multiple organ dysfunction. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/48 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula, and their ABG values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a soft and non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present. The patient's skin is warm and without rash or jaundice. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with no signs of sedation or paralysis.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 17.2, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 98. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL.

The patient's medical plan includes treatment for sepsis, acute renal failure, and other complications. The patient is receiving antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications to manage their condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, or cardiovascular instability.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and ARDS may develop if the patient's oxygenation requirements increase.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and cardiovascular instability may occur if the patient's blood pressure drops or becomes too high.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and renal failure may become more severe if not managed promptly.
5. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state makes them susceptible to secondary infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and thrombocytopenia may worsen if not managed promptly.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is being closely monitored, and deficiencies may occur if not managed promptly.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes."
