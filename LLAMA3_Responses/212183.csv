   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient hypotensive currently requiring levophed.  Given the
   patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence infectious
   source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but given severe
   leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most concerning for C.
   diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary source.  Pt with history
   of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL, pseudomonas,
   stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA. Although degree
   of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary symptoms makes pna
   or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult recs
   - will need to place Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem (day1: [**12-31**])
   - cont hydrocort 50mg q6
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - d/c prednisone given initiated hydrocort
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF.
   - will hold po rate control meds given hypotension
   - will give IV metoprolol prn for rates > 100
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   .
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   .
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
* The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypotension, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.
* The patient has been on invasive ventilation for 24 hours, and his vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 111 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/51 mmHg.
* The patient has a severe leukocytosis of 30,000 cells per microliter, and his differential count shows 96.8% neutrophils, 1.9% lymphocytes, and 1.0% monocytes.
* The patient has a history of resistant organisms, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
* The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis, and his treatment plan includes vancomycin and metronidazole.
* The patient has a history of chronic GVHD, and his treatment plan includes mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone.
* The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on lovenox for anticoagulation.
* The patient has a history of depression and is taking citalopram.
* The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, and his treatment plan includes low-molecular-weight heparin (LMW heparin) for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis due to C. diff colitis or other sources of infection
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications
* Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to pulmonary sources of infection
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock due to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac conditions
* Thrombotic events, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, due to the patient's history of thrombotic events and anticoagulation therapy
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to C. diff colitis or other gastrointestinal conditions
* Infections due to resistant organisms, including VRE, ESBL-producing bacteria, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient found to by hypotensive at rehab yesterday.  Given
   the patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence
   infectious source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but
   given severe leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most
   concerning for C. diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary
   source.  Pt with history of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL,
   pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas. Other sources include bactermia from his
   midline, UTI are less likely. Pt is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult
   - Central venous line
   - a-line placement
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem for pneumonia
   - monitor Hct
   - pt is on chronic steroids will plan to give stress dose steroids
   (hydrocort 50mg q6) if persistently hypotensive despite IVF
   - check cortisol
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - CXR
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Respiratory viral screen/culture
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Likely ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.  Also possible that
   he is pre-renal from diarrhea and volume depletion.
   - check urine lytes and eos
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:16, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - cont prednisone, but will plan to start stress dose steroids if
   persisent hypotension
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient hypotensive currently requiring levophed.  Given the
   patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence infectious
   source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but given severe
   leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most concerning for C.
   diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary source.  Pt with history
   of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL, pseudomonas,
   stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA. Although degree
   of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary symptoms makes pna
   or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult recs
   - will need to place Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem (day1: [**12-31**])
   - cont hydrocort 50mg q6
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - d/c prednisone given initiated hydrocort
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF.
   - will hold po rate control meds given hypotension
   - will give IV metoprolol prn for rates > 100
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   .
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   .
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting
   .
   #. Access: PIV and midline
   - will need to place CVL

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. He presents from Hospital 630 with hypotension and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. 

The patient has a broad differential diagnosis for his hypotension, including sepsis, C. diff colitis, and cardiogenic shock. He is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole for C. diff colitis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis. 

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by chronic bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans, and he is currently receiving invasive ventilation. 

The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5 on admission, which has improved to 1.2 with IV fluids. The patient is at risk for acute kidney injury due to his underlying condition and the use of nephrotoxic medications. 

The patient's recent history includes multiple thrombotic events, including PE and DVT, and he is currently receiving LMW heparin for DVT prophylaxis. 

The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not treated promptly.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis may be indicative of C. diff colitis, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration if not treated promptly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's impaired kidney function and use of nephrotoxic medications may lead to acute kidney injury if not managed properly.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient's history of PE and DVT may increase his risk for future thrombotic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent history of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections may increase his risk for future infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and recent use of anticoagulant medications may increase his risk for future GI bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Patient hypotensive currently requiring levophed.  Given the
   patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence infectious
   source is concerning.  The differential dx is broad, but given severe
   leukocytosis of 30K and 2 days of diarrhea it is most concerning for C.
   diff. Other possible sources include pulmonary source.  Pt with history
   of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL, pseudomonas,
   stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA. Although degree
   of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary symptoms makes pna
   or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for atypical infections
   given immunocompromised state, although he has been on ppx with bactrim
   (although recently restarted), voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro &
   acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume depleted from diarrhea.  Also
   on the differential is cardiogenic, but unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult recs
   - will need to place Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem (day1: [**12-31**])
   - cont hydrocort 50mg q6
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   .
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) post Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) complicated by Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), intermittent ventilator dependence, and bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD.
* The patient presented to the ICU with hypotension and was found to have severe leukocytosis (30K) and 2 days of diarrhea, which is concerning for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis.
* The patient has a history of resistant organisms, including Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL), Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas.
* The patient's current medications include vancomycin, meropenem, metronidazole, and hydrocortisone, and he is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics with bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithromycin, and acyclovir.
* The patient has a history of acute kidney injury, and his creatinine has improved from 1.5 to 1.2 with intravenous fluids (IVF).
* The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on lovenox for anticoagulation.
* The patient has a history of depression and is currently taking citalopram.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

* C. diff colitis, which may lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
* Respiratory failure, which may lead to ventilator dependence and increased risk of nosocomial infections.
* Acute kidney injury, which may lead to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
* Atrial fibrillation, which may lead to stroke, heart failure, and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.
* Depression, which may lead to decreased quality of life, increased risk of morbidity, and increased risk of mortality.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and mortality.
* Sepsis, which may lead to organ failure, increased risk of mortality, and prolonged hospital stay.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Improved, Patient initially hypotensive requiring levophed,
   weaned off overnight. C diff positive, making this likely shock from c
   diff colitis.
     Given the patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence
   infectious source is still concerning and differential dx is broad,
   however c diff would explain clinical picture.
   Pt with history of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL,
   pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA.
   Although degree of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary
   symptoms makes pna or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for
   atypical infections given immunocompromised state, although he has been
   on ppx with bactrim (although recently restarted), voriconazole,
   tobramycin, azithro & acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume
   depleted from diarrhea.  Also on the differential is cardiogenic, but
   unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult recs
   - will need to place Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem (day1: [**12-31**])
   - cont hydrocort 50mg q6
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - d/c prednisone given initiated hydrocort
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF.
   - will hold po rate control meds given hypotension
   - will give IV metoprolol prn for rates > 100
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting
   #. Access: PIV and midline
   - will need to place CVL
   #. Code Status: FULL Code

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # C Diff colitis - Patient initially hypotensive requiring levophed,
   weaned off overnight. C diff positive, making this likely shock from c
   diff colitis.  All other culture data negative.  Now off pressors as of
   5 am.  Given SOB, concern for intra-abdominal perforation.  No free air
   visible on our read of KUB.
   - call surgery
   - f/u final read KUB
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension (day 1
 [**12-31**])
   - stop meropenem and IV vancomycin given  no other evidence of
   infectious source
   - continue stress-dose steroids for one more day
   - Pressors to goal CVP 8-12 (will not give more IVF for now)
   - Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - f/u CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve daily
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   - ABG and lactate 1500
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - restart prednisone when hydrocort is stopped (likely tomorrow)
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) post-Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT), complicated by Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), and bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD. He presents to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has a central line, tracheostomy, and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is:

* Hypotensive with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg
* Shock from C. difficile colitis, which is likely the cause of his hypotension
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL
* Respiratory failure with volume overload and intermittent ventilator dependence
* Chronic GVHD with bronchiolitis obliterans
* History of PE and DVT
* Atrial fibrillation
* Opiate requirement
* Depression
* C. difficile colitis is being treated with vancomycin and flagyl
* Acute kidney injury is being treated with IV fluids and diuretics
* Respiratory failure is being treated with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. C. difficile colitis can lead to septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death if not properly treated.
2. Acute kidney injury can progress to chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory failure can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and death if not properly managed.
4. Chronic GVHD can lead to bronchiolitis obliterans, pulmonary fibrosis, and death if not properly managed.
5. Atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, cardiac arrest, and death if not properly managed.
6. Opiate withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms, including agitation, tremors, and seizures, if not properly managed.
7. Depression can lead to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and death if not properly managed.
8. C. difficile colitis can lead to intra-abdominal perforation, peritonitis, and death if not properly treated.
9. Acute kidney injury can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death if not properly managed.
10. Respiratory failure can lead to pneumonia, sepsis, and death if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to ensure prompt recognition and management of any complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # C Diff colitis - Patient initially hypotensive requiring levophed,
   weaned off overnight. C diff positive, making this likely shock from c
   diff colitis.  All other culture data negative.  Now off pressors as of
   5 am.  Given SOB, concern for intra-abdominal perforation.  No free air
   visible on our read of KUB.
   - call surgery
   - f/u final read KUB
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension (day 1
 [**12-31**])
   - stop meropenem and IV vancomycin given  no other evidence of
   infectious source
   - continue stress-dose steroids for one more day
   - Pressors to goal CVP 8-12 (will not give more IVF for now)
   - Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - f/u CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve daily
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   - ABG and lactate 1500
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - restart prednisone when hydrocort is stopped (likely tomorrow)
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,
   currently on lower dose
   - monitor for sx of withdrawal
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting
   #. Access: PIV and midline
   - will need to place CVL

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post bone marrow transplant (BMT), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with hypotension and suspected C. diff colitis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 104 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 119/92 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 30.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 24 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* C. diff colitis
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Respiratory failure
* Chronic GVHD
* History of PE and DVT
* Atrial fibrillation
* Opiate dependence
* Depression

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Administration of vancomycin and flagyl for C. diff colitis
* Weaning off pressors
* Stress-dose steroids for one more day
* Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins
* Continuation of ventilator support
* Infectious workup for respiratory source
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer
* Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and depression

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of C. diff colitis and development of sepsis
* Progression of AKI to end-stage renal disease
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Development of new thrombotic events
* Opiate withdrawal syndrome
* Depression and suicidal ideation

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT
   [**2121**] complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and
   bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator
   dependence who presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension.
   .
   Plan:
   # Shock - Improved, Patient initially hypotensive requiring levophed,
   weaned off overnight. C diff positive, making this likely shock from c
   diff colitis.
     Given the patient's immunocompromised state and ventilator dependence
   infectious source is still concerning and differential dx is broad,
   however c diff would explain clinical picture.
   Pt with history of resistant organisms including VRE, ESBL,
   pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas. Other sources include UTI given + UA.
   Although degree of leukocytosis and absence of urinary or pulmonary
   symptoms makes pna or urosepsis less likely. Pt also is at risk for
   atypical infections given immunocompromised state, although he has been
   on ppx with bactrim (although recently restarted), voriconazole,
   tobramycin, azithro & acyclovir.  Additionally, pt my be volume
   depleted from diarrhea.  Also on the differential is cardiogenic, but
   unlikely.
   - po vanco and IV flagyl for c. diff colitis presenting with
   hypotension
   -  CT-scan of the abd/pelvis to eval for colitis
   - Surgery consult recs
   - will need to place Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics with Vanco/Meropenem (day1: [**12-31**])
   - cont hydrocort 50mg q6
   - trend lactate
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u stool studies
   - cont ppx with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithro, tobra
   - check CMV VL
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF. FeNa 0.3  Likely pre-renal (improved with
   IVF) vs ATN in the setting of persisent hypotension.
   - IVF
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt intermittently ventilator dependent.  He
   underwent trach on last admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH
   were AC Vt:600, RR:20, FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - plan to continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - d/c prednisone given initiated hydrocort
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs

   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - cont lovenox 40mg q12 per prior regimen
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF.
   - will hold po rate control meds given hypotension
   - will give IV metoprolol prn for rates > 100
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Depression: cont citalopram
   #. FEN: hold TF given nausea/vomiting

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) radiograph: pending
* Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan: attempted, but unclear due to patient's condition

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* C. diff infection: severe, with diarrhea improved but white blood cell count still elevated
* Hypotension: weaned off pressors, on stress dose steroids, with potential for further drops in blood pressure
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): elevated creatinine, with goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg
* Respiratory failure: chronic, with continued vent support while acutely ill
* Anasarca: massive, with potential for further fluid accumulation
* Sepsis: potential, with ongoing infection and inflammation

The patient's plan includes:

* Discontinuation of vancomycin and meropenem
* Surgical consultation for early colectomy
* KUB radiograph and abdominal CT scan
* Monitoring of lactate and arterial blood gas (ABG) to assess for acidosis
* Continued vent support and respiratory care
* Stress dose steroids and prophylaxis for stress ulcer and venous thromboembolism (VTE)
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and VTE

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and potential complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their various medical conditions, including C. diff infection, hypotension, AKI, respiratory failure, and anasarca."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 1.9 today. Recent
   FeNa 0.3%. Likely pre-renal vs ATN in the setting of persisent
   hypotension.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - hold mycophenolate mofetil; discuss with oncology
   - hydrocort to q8h
   - cont ppx bactim, voriconazole, tobramycin, azithro and acyclovir.
   - BMT is aware and will f/u on recs
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - hold enoxaparin, switch to hep gtt given possible surgery
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,
   currently on lower dose

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 37.3°C, HR: 109 bpm, BP: 102/64 mmHg, RR: 22 breaths/min, SpO2: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.05 mcg/kg/min
* Fluid balance: Total input of 4,219 mL, total output of 3,406 mL, with a balance of -92 mL
* Respiratory support: Tracheostomy tube, ventilator mode: CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, PEEP: 5 cmH2O, FiO2: 50%
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 27.4, 35.0, 35.0, 42.4
	+ Hct: 24.5, 24.6, 26.4, 30.9
	+ Plt: 297, 301, 324, 280
	+ Cr: 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.9
	+ TCO2: 25, 23, 21, 20

	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.1/37.4/1.0, ALT/AST: 3-8, Alk Phos/T Bili: 345/0.2, Amylase/Lipase: 9

The patient has the following medical complications:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, likely pre-renal or ATN in the setting of persistent hypotension
* Respiratory failure with volume overload and intermittent ventilator dependence
* C. diff colitis with septic shock, requiring emergent surgery consideration
* Chronic GVHD, complicated by bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans
* History of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Emergent surgery consideration for C. diff colitis
* Levophed infusion to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
* Bolus with 500 cc NS and monitor u/o, stool output, and BP closely
* Continue PO and PR vancomycin 500mg Q6 and IV metronidazole (day 1)
* Start tigecycline per ID recs
* Continue stress-dose steroids for one more day
* Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures
* Continue prophylaxis with bactrim, voriconazole, acyclovir, azithromycin, and tobramycin
* Follow-up CMV VL
* Plan to hold narcotics while hypotensive

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progressive AKI requiring dialysis
* Respiratory failure requiring increased ventilator support or intubation
* C. diff colitis requiring surgical intervention
* Chronic GVHD exacerbation
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis recurrence
* Septic shock requiring increased vasopressor support or vasopressin therapy
* Worsening of bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans
* Opiate withdrawal syndrome if narcotics are held for an extended period
* Depression or anxiety exacerbation if antidepressant therapy is discontinued."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [**Last Name (un) **] admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), and chronic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been stable, with vital signs within normal range. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, and urinalysis reveals red cell casts, suggesting acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) likely caused by azithromycin, cefepime, or vancomycin. The patient is receiving fluids and has been on a fluid challenge, with a total fluid balance of 4,219 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression to septic shock: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to septic shock, which could be life-threatening.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and red cell casts in the urine suggest acute kidney injury, which could progress to acute renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressors may indicate cardiovascular instability, which could worsen and lead to cardiac arrest.
5. Infection progression: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and presence of multiple antibiotics may increase the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's risk of developing a venous thromboembolism is increased due to immobility and the presence of multiple lines."

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock: septic with renal failure. From C.diff colitis. Volume
   resustation on going, given an additional 500cc now and assess
   q30minutes. Continue vanco po/pr, flagyl iv, will start tigecyline per
   ID. Decreased stress dose to q8.
   C.diff colitis: lactate increasing, more acidemic, abdomen more
   distended, wbc increased. Will ask heme onc if we can d/c cellcept.
   Will continue ongoing discussion with surgery,w e are concerned that
   window of opportunity to operate on him is closing.  change as many
   oral meds to iv as possible.
   ARF: likley ATN, vs prerenal.. sediment reported ? RBC casts
   exceedingly unlikely to have GN on cellcept and associated C.diff..will
   resend.. will continue hydration, electrolyte monitoring. Adjust meds
   to renal function
   Chronic respiratory failure: continue vent support at the current
   settings, not able to wean currenlty due to overwhelming sepsis and
   critical C.diff. PIP 15.
   DVT: will d/c lovenox and start heparin drip without bolus.
   Will meet with family to discuss goals and whether surgery would be an
   option.

   I saw and examined the pt, and was physically present with the ICU team
   for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10399**]
   note, including assessment and plan. 58 yo male s/p BMT with chronic
   GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, resp failure s/p trach, admitted with
   CDiff colitis and severe sepsis.
   Despite abx coverage with flagyl/vanco (PO/PR) he has continued to
   deteriorate with worsening multiorgan failure- shock requiring
   pressors, increasing acidosis, acute renal failure, tachypnea/abdominal
   pain, worsening leukocytosis, acute on chronic resp failure.
   Discussed with surgery and ID with recommendations for surgery- however
   after discussion of pt
s overall poor status, the magnitude of the
   operation, and high likelihood of poor prognosis/lengthy post-op
   course, his family has opted not to proceed with surgery. They
   recognize that medical management is not likely to be enough to
   adequately manage his CDiff colitis.
   Remains on flagyl, vanco, and adding tigecycline.
   On pressors, ventilator support with no plans to wean.
   Goals are to maintain current level of care and to facilitate pt
   comfort. If he were to deteriorate to the point of cardiac arrest, his
   family agrees that chest compressions/shock would not add significantly
   to his overall care, except to potentially cause him more discomfort.
   After further discussion, he is DNR. We will continue to keep in close
   contact with the family, but they are leaning toward re-addressing
   goals of care if there is no significant improvement in his status by
   tomorrow.
   Pt is critically ill.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Will continue ongoing discussion with surgery,w e are concerned that
   window of opportunity to operate on him is closing.  change as many
   oral meds to iv as possible.
   ARF: likley ATN, vs prerenal.. sediment reported ? RBC casts
   exceedingly unlikely to have GN on cellcept and associated C.diff..will
   resend.. will continue hydration, electrolyte monitoring. Adjust meds
   to renal function
   Chronic respiratory failure: continue vent support at the current
   settings, not able to wean currenlty due to overwhelming sepsis and
   critical C.diff. PIP 15.
   DVT: will d/c lovenox and start heparin drip without bolus.
   Will meet with family to discuss goals and whether surgery would be an

   after discussion of pt
s overall poor status, the magnitude of the

   On pressors, ventilator support with no plans to wean.
   Goals are to maintain current level of care and to facilitate pt

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted with C.diff colitis and severe sepsis. Despite antibiotics, his condition has continued to deteriorate, with worsening multiorgan failure, including shock, acute renal failure, tachypnea, abdominal pain, and worsening leukocytosis. He is currently on pressors, ventilator support, and has a high likelihood of poor prognosis.

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is worsening, and he is at risk of further deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and he is at risk of further renal damage.
3. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is not improving, and he is at risk of further respiratory decline.
4. C.diff Colitis: The patient's C.diff colitis is not responding to treatment, and he is at risk of further complications, including perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis.
5. DVT: The patient has a high risk of developing DVT due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
6. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to be due to ATN, and he is at risk of further renal damage.
7. Shock: The patient's shock is not responding to treatment, and he is at risk of further deterioration.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's family has opted for a DNR status, and if he were to deteriorate to the point of cardiac arrest, his family agrees that chest compressions/shock would not add significantly to his overall care.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics, including flagyl, vanco, and tigecycline, to manage the C.diff colitis and sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly.
3. Continue ventilator support and monitor for signs of respiratory decline.
4. Monitor for signs of DVT and consider prophylactic anticoagulation.
5. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize renal function.
6. Continue to discuss goals of care with the family and consider re-addressing goals if there is no significant improvement in the patient's status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock: septic with renal failure. From C.diff colitis. Volume
   resustation on going, given an additional 500cc now and assess
   q30minutes. Continue vanco po/pr, flagyl iv, will start tigecyline per
   ID. Decreased stress dose to q8.
   C.diff colitis: lactate increasing, more acidemic, abdomen more
   distended, wbc increased. Will ask heme onc if we can d/c cellcept.
   Will continue ongoing discussion with surgery,w e are concerned that
   window of opportunity to operate on him is closing.  change as many
   oral meds to iv as possible.
   ARF: likley ATN, vs prerenal.. sediment reported ? RBC casts
   exceedingly unlikely to have GN on cellcept and associated C.diff..will
   resend.. will continue hydration, electrolyte monitoring. Adjust meds
   to renal function
   Chronic respiratory failure: continue vent support at the current
   settings, not able to wean currenlty due to overwhelming sepsis and
   critical C.diff. PIP 15.
   DVT: will d/c lovenox and start heparin drip without bolus.
   Will meet with family to discuss goals and whether surgery would be an
   option.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock: septic with renal failure. From C.diff colitis. Volume
   resustation on going, given an additional 500cc now and assess
   q30minutes. Continue vanco po/pr, flagyl iv, will start tigecyline per
   ID. Decreased stress dose to q8.
   C.diff colitis: lactate increasing, more acidemic, abdomen more
   distended, wbc increased. Will ask heme onc if we can d/c cellcept.
   Will continue ongoing discussion with surgery,w e are concerned that
   window of opportunity to operate on him is closing.  change as many
   oral meds to iv as possible.
   ARF: likley ATN, vs prerenal.. sediment reported ? RBC casts
   exceedingly unlikely to have GN on cellcept and associated C.diff..will
   resend.. will continue hydration, electrolyte monitoring. Adjust meds
   to renal function
   Chronic respiratory failure: continue vent support at the current
   settings, not able to wean currenlty due to overwhelming sepsis and
   critical C.diff. PIP 15.
   DVT: will d/c lovenox and start heparin drip without bolus.
   Will meet with family to discuss goals and whether surgery would be an
   option.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with septic shock, renal failure, and C.diff colitis. They have a history of chronic respiratory failure and are currently on ventilator support. The patient's abdominal pain is managed with morphine, and they are receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and tigecycline. The patient's C.diff colitis is worsening, with increasing lactate levels, acidemia, and abdominal distension. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and they have a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's medical history includes chronic respiratory failure, and they are currently receiving oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. This could lead to further organ dysfunction, including kidney and liver failure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI. This could lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and the need for dialysis.
3. C.diff colitis: The patient's C.diff colitis is worsening, and there is a high risk of developing toxic megacolon, which could lead to bowel perforation and sepsis.
4. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed effectively. This could lead to further complications, including respiratory acidosis and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. DVT: The patient has a high risk of developing DVT due to their immobility and underlying medical conditions. This could lead to further complications, including pulmonary embolism and sepsis.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, due to their compromised immune system and underlying medical conditions.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's lack of oral intake and high caloric needs suggest malnutrition. This could lead to further complications, including muscle wasting and impaired wound healing.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which could lead to further complications, including muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition and high-risk profile, it is essential to provide close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications. This should include frequent assessments of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition, as well as prompt intervention to address any emerging complications."

   Septic shock: source is C.diff colitis. continue vanco po/pr,
   tigecylcine, IVIG, iv flagyl. Supportive care with IVF. wbc slightly
   up, lactate rising, more acidemic, renal failure worsening. continue
   volume resusitation. goal CVp 8-12. HCP opted against surgery for
   colectomy.
   Renal Failure: worsening, somewhat more acidemic, electolytes still in
   reasonable rise. will follow up electrolytes close. more hyponatremic,
   continue volume resusitation. goal CVp 8-12
   Fever: pan culture, obtain CXR.. will not broaden empirically given
   severe lifethreating C.diff.
   Respiratory failrue: continue supportive care not able to wean off due
   to abdominal sepsis.
   FEN: holding tube feeds due to high residuals.
   DVT/PE: on heparin iv
   Hyponatremia: continue IVF resusitation.  recheck set of electrolytes
   later today.
   Pain: use dilaudid over morphine due to worsening renal failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Septic shock: source is C.diff colitis. continue vanco po/pr,
   tigecylcine, IVIG, iv flagyl. Supportive care with IVF. wbc slightly
   up, lactate rising, more acidemic, renal failure worsening. continue
   volume resusitation. goal CVp 8-12. HCP opted against surgery for
   colectomy.
   Renal Failure: worsening, somewhat more acidemic, electolytes still in
   reasonable rise. will follow up electrolytes close. more hyponatremic,
   continue volume resusitation. goal CVp 8-12
   Fever: pan culture, obtain CXR.. will not broaden empirically given
   severe lifethreating C.diff.
   Respiratory failrue: continue supportive care not able to wean off due
   to abdominal sepsis.
   FEN: holding tube feeds due to high residuals.
   DVT/PE: on heparin iv
   Hyponatremia: continue IVF resusitation.  recheck set of electrolytes
   later today.
   Pain: use dilaudid over morphine due to worsening renal failure.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post-bone marrow transplant (BMT), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respiratory failure post-tracheostomy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently critically ill with severe Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 100.6°F (38.1°C)
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 83/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 35.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 96 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 140 mg/dL
* Glucose: 140 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 102 mEq/L, potassium 129 mEq/L, magnesium 2.0 mg/dL, phosphorus 5.6 mg/dL

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for C. difficile, vasopressors to support blood pressure, and medications for pain and respiratory support.

The patient's condition is critical, with worsening acute renal failure, continued acidosis, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with no plans to wean vent settings.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL, indicating worsening renal failure. This may lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potential need for dialysis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of C. difficile and sepsis. This may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and the patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he requires vasopressors to support blood pressure. This may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and he may require further monitoring and management to prevent potential complications.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing secondary infections, particularly in the setting of C. difficile and sepsis. This may lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction may lead to further complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and gastrointestinal failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent potential complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with severe C.diff colitis, septic shock, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with rising lactate levels, worsening acidemia, and increasing fluid requirements.

The patient is receiving supportive care, including vasopressors, IV fluids, and antibiotics. The patient is also receiving IVIG and flagyl for the C.diff colitis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 100.6°F (38.1°C)
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 83/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 5 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 35.0 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.6%
* Platelet count (Plt): 96 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 203 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 5.6 mg/dL

The patient's microbiology results show no new growth since December 31.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin, tigecycline, IVIG, and flagyl for C.diff colitis
* Supporting the patient with IV fluids and vasopressors
* Monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely
* Reassessing the patient's electrolyte levels and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Considering the possibility of colectomy, but currently opting against it

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, respiratory failure)
* Worsening of C.diff colitis, leading to further complications (e.g., perforation, hemorrhage)
* Development of DVT/PE due to immobility and underlying medical conditions
* Hyponatremia and worsening electrolyte imbalance
* Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
* Cardiac complications due to septic shock and underlying cardiac conditions
* Infection-related encephalopathy or sepsis-related encephalopathy"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing leukocytosis, and a large abdominal distension.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and analgesics. They are also receiving IVIG for low IgG and C. diff infection. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results indicate severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and C. diff infection. The patient's hemodynamic parameters are concerning, with a central venous pressure of 5 mmHg and a total fluid input of 2,533 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a FiO2 of 60% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.18, with a PaCO2 of 42 mmHg and a PaO2 of 60 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Progressive sepsis with organ dysfunction, leading to multi-organ failure.
2. Acute kidney injury or failure, requiring dialysis.
3. C. diff colitis, leading to severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
5. Hypotension and shock, requiring vasopressor therapy.
6. Impaired skin integrity, leading to pressure ulcers and skin breakdown.
7. Acute pain, requiring effective pain management.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of their underlying conditions. This may include adjustments to their antibiotic therapy, fluid management, and respiratory support. Additionally, the patient's pain and discomfort should be thoroughly assessed and managed to prevent further complications."

   This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT [**2121**]
   complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
   obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who
   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in mid 40s. Minimal stool output now.
   - continue PO and PR vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline
 already
   received IVIG; increase metronidazole to q6h
   - pressor as needed to maintain BP and urine output
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - re-check blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - d/c bactrim, voriconazole, azithro per ID; continue acyclovir, tobra
   inh
   - discuss goal of care as below
   # Goal of care: family is aware of patient
s grim diagnosis. Outpatient
   oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**], is aware and following. Code status has been
   changed to DNR/DNI.
   - continue to update family
   - continue to update all providers involved
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.5 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are noted:

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema over the back, multiple skin breakdowns, and ecchymoses, indicating poor wound healing and increased risk of infection.
2. Sepsis, Severe (with Organ Dysfunction): The patient has a high white blood cell count, metabolic acidosis, and worsening leukocytosis, suggesting a severe infection.
3. Shock, Hypovolemic or Hemorrhagic: The patient is receiving escalating doses of norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, indicating hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and they are producing minimal urine, indicating acute kidney injury.
5. C. difficile Infection (C. diff Colitis, C. difficile): The patient has a history of C. diff colitis and is currently being treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, and tigecycline.
6. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has a history of bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is intermittently ventilator dependent.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm.
8. Opiate Requirement: The patient has a history of requiring high doses of narcotics and is currently on a lower dose, with the risk of withdrawal symptoms.
9. Depression/Anxiety: The patient is being treated for depression and anxiety.
10. History of PE and DVT: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with ongoing anticoagulation therapy.

Potential issues to be addressed:

1. Continued monitoring of the patient's skin integrity and wound healing.
2. Close monitoring of the patient's sepsis and shock status, with adjustments to treatment as needed.
3. Ongoing management of the patient's acute kidney injury, including monitoring of creatinine levels and urine output.
4. Continued treatment of the patient's C. difficile infection, including monitoring of stool output and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed.
5. Ongoing management of the patient's chronic respiratory failure, including weaning of ventilator support and adjusting oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Monitoring of the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Monitoring of the patient's opiate requirement and adjusting treatment as needed to minimize withdrawal symptoms.
8. Ongoing treatment of the patient's depression and anxiety, including monitoring of symptoms and adjusting therapy as needed.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications and improve their overall health."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT, complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence, and C. diff colitis. The patient is currently in septic shock, requiring escalating doses of norepinephrine, and has oliguria. The patient has a high fever, and cultures have been sent for blood, urine, and sputum.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased, and the patient is producing minimal urine output, which can worsen the AKI.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans can exacerbate respiratory failure, and the patient's current ventilator dependence may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. C. diff colitis: The patient's C. diff colitis can lead to further complications, including sepsis, organ dysfunction, and poor gut function.
5. Shock: The patient's hypotension and oliguria can worsen the shock, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's AKI can progress to renal failure, which can require dialysis and further complicate the patient's condition.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's septic shock and hypotension can lead to cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
8. Infections: The patient's compromised immune system and C. diff colitis can increase the risk of secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's C. diff colitis can lead to gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potential bowel perforation.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's severe illness and potential for poor outcomes can lead to psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and existential concerns.

The patient's care plan should focus on addressing these potential complications, including:

1. Managing septic shock and hypotension with pressors and fluid resuscitation.
2. Treating C. diff colitis with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Managing AKI with fluid management and potential dialysis.
4. Weaning the patient from the ventilator and optimizing respiratory function.
5. Managing cardiovascular instability with cardiac monitoring and medication.
6. Preventing secondary infections with antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures.
7. Managing gastrointestinal complications with supportive care and potential surgical intervention.
8. Addressing psychological distress with counseling and support services."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 101.1°F, heart rate 127 bpm, blood pressure 127/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 35.0, hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, platelet count 324, creatinine 2.7 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 203 IU/L.
* Radiology: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed no perfusion.
* Medications: The patient is receiving norepinephrine, metronidazole, tigecycline, vancomycin, and acyclovir.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute.
* Renal support: The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has a creatinine clearance of 10 cc/hour.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and he is producing only 10 cc of urine per hour. This may indicate worsening renal function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory rate is increasing. This may indicate worsening respiratory function.
3. Sepsis: The patient is septic, and his white blood cell count is elevated. This may indicate a high risk of sepsis-related complications.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and his abdominal CT scan showed no perfusion. This may indicate a high risk of complications related to C. difficile colitis.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and he is producing only 10 cc of urine per hour. This may indicate worsening acute kidney injury.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to manage his septic shock and respiratory failure.
3. Continue to provide renal support with intravenous fluids and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory function closely and consider adjusting his mechanical ventilation settings as necessary.
5. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to treat his C. difficile colitis and sepsis.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide adequate nutrition to support his recovery.
7. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further management of his acute kidney injury.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual with multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) post-bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with septic shock, C. difficile colitis, and acute kidney injury. The patient is requiring escalating doses of norepinephrine and has oliguria. He has a history of intermittent ventilator dependence and has undergone tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating poor renal perfusion. AKI can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is currently experiencing volume overload. Weaning off oxygen and adjusting ventilator settings are crucial to prevent respiratory failure.
4. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis can lead to severe diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of sepsis.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury can progress to chronic kidney disease, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
6. Thrombotic Events: The patient has a history of PE and DVT, and is at risk for future thrombotic events, which can lead to limb loss, pulmonary embolism, and increased mortality.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is at risk for recurrent episodes, which can increase the risk of stroke and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Opiate Dependence: The patient has a history of high-dose narcotics and is at risk for opiate dependence and withdrawal symptoms.
9. Depression/Anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, which can worsen with the current medical condition and increase the risk of suicide.
10. Infection: The patient is at risk for secondary infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, which can worsen his condition and increase mortality.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue PO and PR vancomycin, metronidazole, and tigecycline to treat C. difficile colitis and sepsis.
2. Increase metronidazole to q6h to improve stool output.
3. Pressor therapy as needed to maintain blood pressure and urine output.
4. Continue stress-dose steroids to manage adrenal insufficiency.
5. Re-check blood, urine, and sputum cultures to monitor for secondary infections.
6. D/C bactrim, voriconazole, and azithro per ID and continue acyclovir and tobramycin inhaler.
7. Discuss goal of care with the family, including DNR/DNI status.
8. Continue to update the family and all providers involved.
9. Treat shock and AKI with fluid management and renally dosed medications.
10. Monitor for signs of opiate withdrawal and adjust pain management accordingly.
11. Continue stress-dose steroids and monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency.
12. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
13. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
14. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management and medications accordingly.
15. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medications as needed to manage depression and anxiety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a complex medical history, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), respiratory failure after tracheostomy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bronchiolitis obliterans, and severe Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis and sepsis.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with the following conditions:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to require intravenous fluid boluses to maintain his urine output.
2. Fever: The patient's temperature is 102.0°F (39.0°C), which is concerning for worsening abdominal sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and he is at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Sepsis: The patient is septic with worsening acute renal failure, septic shock, acidosis, and acute on chronic respiratory failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and is at risk of further respiratory deterioration.
6. C. diff colitis: The patient has severe C. diff colitis and is being treated with antibiotics, but the infection is not responding to treatment.
7. Megacolon: The patient's lack of stool output is concerning for megacolon, and a kidney, ureters, and bladder (KUB) study is planned.

The patient's prognosis is poor, and his condition is expected to worsen without further interventions. The plan is to continue antibiotics, pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP), and mechanical ventilation. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Further deterioration of his renal function, leading to AKI or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
2. Progression of his respiratory failure, leading to respiratory arrest or chronic respiratory disease.
3. Development of further septicemia or sepsis, leading to multi-organ failure.
4. Megacolon, which can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, or necrosis.
5. C. diff colitis, which can lead to severe colonic inflammation, perforation, or necrosis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, which can lead to life-threatening complications.
7. Development of further complications related to his underlying medical conditions, such as GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans, or chronic respiratory failure.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration and optimize his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues. The patient's chief complaint is hypotension, and they continue to require iVF boluses to maintain urine output. They are febrile, with a temperature of 102.0°F, and have no known drug allergies.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors. They have a tracheostomy tube and are receiving mechanical ventilation. Their respiratory status is stable, but they have chronic respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL, and worsening liver function, with an AST level of 35 IU/L and an ALT level of 10 IU/L. Their electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 16 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of cancer and is receiving chemotherapy. They have a high risk of developing sepsis, and their prognosis is grim.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and worsening abdominal symptoms suggest a high risk of developing sepsis. This can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ongoing mechanical ventilation make them at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and high creatinine level indicate a high risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests suggest a high risk of developing liver failure.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest a high risk of developing cardiac arrest.
6. Multi-organ failure: The patient's multiple medical issues and high risk of developing sepsis make them at risk for multi-organ failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues. They require close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage their conditions and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's current status and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT, complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans. He presents with C. diff colitis, septic shock, and oliguria. He is currently receiving escalating doses of norepinephrine and has a high risk of developing further complications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.7, indicating acute kidney injury. This may worsen due to poor renal perfusion, high intra-abdominal pressure, and potential nephrotoxins.
2. **Sepsis:** The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which increases the risk of further complications, such as septic shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with volume overload and intermittent ventilator dependence. Weaning O2 as tolerated and managing respiratory sources of infection are crucial.
4. **Hypotension:** The patient's blood pressure is labile, requiring pressor support. This increases the risk of further complications, such as cardiac arrest and organ dysfunction.
5. **C. diff Colitis:** The patient's C. diff colitis may worsen, leading to toxic megacolon, perforation, and sepsis.
6. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's gastrointestinal tract is compromised, increasing the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of sepsis and coagulopathy.
7. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent use of norepinephrine increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest.
8. **Pulmonary Embolism:** The patient's history of PE and DVT increases the risk of further thrombotic events, particularly in the setting of sepsis and immobility.
9. **Infectious Complications:** The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly respiratory and urinary tract infections, due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory results closely.
2. Optimize pressor support and vasopressor therapy to maintain blood pressure and urine output.
3. Manage respiratory failure by weaning O2 as tolerated and addressing respiratory sources of infection.
4. Continue stress-dose steroids and consider changing IV voriconazole to PO.
5. Monitor for signs of septic shock, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure.
6. Consider consultation with infectious disease and cardiology specialists to optimize management of the patient's sepsis and cardiovascular status.
7. Review and update the patient's code status and advance directives with the family and healthcare team."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

* Fever: 102.6°F, with increasing pressor requirements and no tylenol absorption
* Hypotension: BP 94/54 mmHg, with a drop in BP from 109/73 mmHg to 76/42 mmHg over the past 24 hours
* Tachycardia: HR 120 bpm
* Respiratory support: Ventilator-assisted breathing with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 2 mmHg, with a drop in CVP from 8 mmHg to 2 mmHg over the past 24 hours
* Fluid balance: Total in 2,464 mL, total out 692 mL, with a balance of 1,772 mL
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 35.0-43.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 26.4-31.7%
	+ Plt: 138-324 K/uL
	+ Cr: 1.3-2.8 mg/dL
	+ TCO2: 16-21 mmol/L
	+ Glucose: 117-140 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: Abnormal results for PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Amylase/Lipase, and LDH

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's abnormal laboratory results, including elevated lactate levels and abnormal liver function tests, suggest organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for ventilator support and abnormal blood gas results suggest respiratory failure.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's history of antibiotic use and abnormal laboratory results suggest the possibility of C. difficile infection.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction if not treated promptly.
7. Pain: The patient's acute pain can lead to decreased mobility, increased risk of complications, and decreased quality of life.
8. Ineffective coping: The patient's family meeting and interdisciplinary rounds suggest that the patient's family may be experiencing stress and anxiety, which can impact the patient's care and outcomes.

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

1. Sepsis bundle: Implement the sepsis bundle, including antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors, to treat sepsis and prevent septic shock.
2. Organ support: Provide supportive care for the patient's organs, including hemodynamic monitoring, fluid management, and respiratory support.
3. Renal replacement therapy: Consider initiating renal replacement therapy if the patient's kidney function does not improve with supportive care.
4. Respiratory support: Continue ventilator support and adjust settings as necessary to improve the patient's oxygenation and ventilation.
5. C. difficile infection treatment: Consider initiating treatment for C. difficile infection if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen.
6. Hypotension management: Manage the patient's hypotension with vasopressors and fluids as necessary.
7. Pain management: Provide adequate pain management to improve the patient's comfort and mobility.
8. Family support: Provide emotional support to the patient's family and address their concerns and stress to improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   decreasing UOP and persistent fever.  Discussed situation with sister
   and she has decided focus on comfort measures with exception of
   continuing mechanical ventilation.  Will stop pressors, antibiotics and
   all nonessential medications.  Begin morphine gtt for comfort/pain
   control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplant (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with bowel obstruction (BO) and severe Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and refractory hypotension.

24-hour events include fever, increasing hypotension, and decreasing urine output (UOP). He has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors, but his condition has not improved. The patient's family has decided to focus on comfort measures, and the ICU team has agreed to stop pressors, antibiotics, and nonessential medications.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.6°F (39.2°C)
* Heart rate: 125 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 86/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

Physical examination reveals:

* Tachypnea
* Endotracheal tube in place
* Cardiovascular examination is normal
* Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and distended
* Extremities show anasarca
* Skin is cool with multiple ulcers
* Neurological examination is not assessable due to sedation

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 35.0 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 324 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 78 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mmol/L
* Potassium: 5.1 mmol/L
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's refractory hypotension and increasing lactate levels suggest septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Clostridioides difficile colitis: The patient's severe Cdiff colitis can lead to further complications, such as bowel perforation, abscesses, and sepsis.
3. Graft-versus-host disease: The patient's GVHD can lead to further complications, such as skin and gastrointestinal manifestations, and increase the risk of infections.
4. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's multi-organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular dysfunction, can lead to further complications and increase the risk of mortality.
5. Sepsis-induced lung injury: The patient's sepsis can lead to sepsis-induced lung injury, which can further compromise his respiratory function.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is critical, and his family has decided to focus on comfort measures. The ICU team should continue to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications and improve his quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient continues to become progressivly more hypotensive with
   decreasing UOP and persistent fever.  Discussed situation with sister
   and she has decided to not escalate further care with additional
   vasopressors.  She wishes to make focus on comfort measures but will
   await her arrival.  For now, continue current care without any further
   escalation.  Continue prn dilaudid for pain control.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) who underwent Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) and developed Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) with Bowel Obstruction (BO). He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with severe Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors. His vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 125 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 86/54 mmHg. He is also experiencing anasarca, cool skin, and multiple ulcers.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest the possibility of septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Multi-organ failure: The patient's unstable vital signs, anasarca, and cool skin suggest the possibility of multi-organ failure, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
3. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.
4. Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis-related complications: The patient's severe Cdiff colitis can lead to complications such as perforation, abscess formation, and toxic megacolon.
5. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD)-related complications: The patient's history of GVHD can lead to complications such as skin rash, liver dysfunction, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
6. Vasopressor-dependent shock: The patient's requirement for vasopressors to maintain blood pressure suggests the possibility of vasopressor-dependent shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust treatment as needed to prevent and treat potential complications.
2. Consider adding additional antibiotics to the patient's regimen to target potential secondary infections.
3. Consider adding a proton pump inhibitor to the patient's regimen to prevent stress ulceration.
4. Consider adding a diuretic to the patient's regimen to help manage fluid overload and anasarca.
5. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to discuss the possibility of endoscopic evaluation and treatment of the patient's Cdiff colitis.
6. Consider consulting with a transplant specialist to discuss the patient's GVHD and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient continues to become progressivly more hypotensive with
   decreasing UOP and persistent fever.  Discussed situation with sister
   and she has decided focus on comfort measures with exception of
   continuing mechanical ventilation.  Will stop pressors, antibiotics and
   all nonessential medications.  Begin morphine gtt for comfort/pain
   control.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with bronchiolitis obliterans. He is currently suffering from severe Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.6°F (39.2°C)
* Heart rate: 125 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 86/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 13 mmHg

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. He has a tracheostomy tube and is receiving infusions of heparin sodium and norepinephrine.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: tachypneic
* Cardiovascular: tachycardia
* Respiratory: clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: soft, non-tender, and distended
* Extremities: anasarca (swelling)
* Skin: cool and multiple ulcers
* Neurologic: sedated, unable to assess movement, tone, or respond to stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 35.0-43.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 324-196 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.3-2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 15-31.7 mg/dL
* Sodium (Na): 138-129 mEq/L
* Potassium (K): 5.1-102 mEq/L
* Chloride (Cl): 78-102 mEq/L
* Calcium (Ca): 6.4-2.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg): 2.2-5.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 5.9-31.7 mg/dL

The patient's condition is critical, and his family has elected to focus on comfort measures, stopping antibiotics and pressors. The patient will continue to receive mechanical ventilation and morphine infusion for pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, cardiac failure, and renal failure.
2. Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis-related complications, such as bowel perforation, abscesses, or toxic megacolon.
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) exacerbation, leading to worsening respiratory failure or other organ dysfunction.
4. Multi-organ failure, including respiratory, cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure.
5. Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or central line-associated bloodstream infection.
6. Nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to immobility and poor perfusion.
8. Respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, or hypoxemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with bowel obstruction (BO). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis, fever, and hypotension. He is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. His vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 125 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 86/54 mmHg. He has a tracheostomy tube and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. His laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. He has a history of anemia, but his current hemoglobin level is 10.3 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's persistent fever, hypotension, and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of septic shock, which could worsen his condition and increase the risk of multiple organ failure.
2. Multi-organ failure: The patient's underlying conditions, such as GVHD and Cdiff colitis, increase his risk of developing multi-organ failure, which could lead to a poor prognosis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and high FiO2 suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
4. Sepsis-related acute kidney injury: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of sepsis-related acute kidney injury, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's Cdiff colitis and bowel obstruction increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
6. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's presence of multiple central lines increases his risk of developing CLABSI, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
7. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient's presence of a Foley catheter increases his risk of developing CAUTI, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely. The patient's sister has decided to focus on comfort measures, and the healthcare team should prioritize his comfort and quality of life while continuing to manage his underlying conditions."

s deteriorating clinical status,
   a decision was made with his sister [**Name (NI) 11689**] to focus on comfort and not
   advance further, including the withdrawal of antibiotics and pressors.
   This morning he was disconnected from the ventilator.
   All other issues are ongoing but will not be actively addressed:
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in 30
s. Minimal stool output now.

   inh
   - KUB
   - discuss goal of care as below
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.7 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   - consider changing IV voriconazole to po
   - wil check voriconazole level
   #. Hyponatermia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatermia from ARF and poor
   UOP.
   -- cont to trend
   -- urine lytes
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - hold mycophenolate mofetil; discussed with oncology
   - hydrocort to q8h
   - change prophylactic regimen as above

   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - hold enoxaparin, switch to hep gtt given possible surgery
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,
   currently on lower dose
   - monitor for sx of withdrawal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 COMFORT CARE (CMO, COMFORT MEASURES)
   This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT [**2121**]
   complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
   obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who
   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # Goasl of care: Based on the patient
s deteriorating clinical status,
   a decision was made with his sister [**Name (NI) 11689**] to focus on comfort and not
   advance further, including the withdrawal of antibiotics and pressors.
   This morning he was disconnected from the ventilator.
   All other issues are ongoing but will not be actively addressed:
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in 30
s. Minimal stool output now.
   - continue PO and PR vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline
 already
   received IVIG; increase metronidazole to q6h
   - pressor as needed to maintain BP and urine output
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - re-check blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c bactrim, voriconazole, azithro per ID; continue acyclovir, tobra
   inh
   - KUB
   - discuss goal of care as below
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.7 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   - consider changing IV voriconazole to po
   - wil check voriconazole level
   #. Hyponatermia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatermia from ARF and poor
   UOP.
   -- cont to trend
   -- urine lytes
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - hold mycophenolate mofetil; discussed with oncology
   - hydrocort to q8h
   - change prophylactic regimen as above
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - hold enoxaparin, switch to hep gtt given possible surgery
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,
   currently on lower dose
   - monitor for sx of withdrawal

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), pulmonary embolism (PE), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with hypotension, C. difficile colitis, and septic shock, requiring escalating doses of norepinephrine. The patient's clinical status has deteriorated, and a decision was made to focus on comfort care, including withdrawal of antibiotics and pressors.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.4°F (39.1°C)
* Heart rate: 108-130 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 33/19 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 35.0-43.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.3-12.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 138-324 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3-2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15-31.7 mmol/L
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.7 mg/dL, and he is producing minimal urine. This may be due to poor renal perfusion and intravascular depletion.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, likely due to hypervolemic hyponatremia from acute kidney injury and poor urine output.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has volume overload and intermittent ventilator dependence. He may require further weaning of oxygen and consideration of non-invasive ventilation.
4. CML s/p BMT: The patient has chronic GVHD and is at risk for further complications, including infections and graft failure.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has a history of PE and DVT, and is receiving heparin. This may increase his risk of HIT.
6. Opiate withdrawal: The patient has a history of high-dose narcotics and may require close monitoring for signs of withdrawal.
7. Depression/anxiety: The patient is receiving citalopram and may require further psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
8. Infections: The patient has C. difficile colitis and may be at risk for further infections, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections.

Based on this information, the patient's primary medical issues are:

1. Septic shock due to C. difficile colitis
2. Acute kidney injury
3. Hyponatremia
4. Respiratory failure
5. Chronic GVHD

The patient's goal of care is focused on comfort, and further medical interventions will be limited. The patient's family has declined surgery, and further treatment will be directed towards managing his symptoms and improving his quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is:

* Fever: 102.4°F (39.1°C) with a Tmax of 39.1°C and a current temperature of 39.1°C.
* Tachycardia: Heart rate is 108-130 beats per minute.
* Hypotension: Blood pressure is 33/19 mmHg, which is within the normal range for the patient.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on a ventilator with a set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O.
* Oxygenation: The patient is receiving 60% oxygen through a tracheostomy tube.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,779 mL of fluids, with a net balance of 1,079 mL.
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count: 35.0-43.1 x 10^9/L
	+ Hemoglobin: 10.3-12.9 g/dL
	+ Platelet count: 138-324 x 10^9/L
	+ Creatinine: 1.3-2.8 mg/dL
	+ Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
	+ Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
	+ LDH: 203 IU/L
	+ Calcium: 6.4 mg/dL
	+ Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
	+ Phosphate: 5.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and they are receiving mechanical ventilation. This may increase the risk of respiratory failure and the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
* Fluid overload: The patient has received a large amount of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
* Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate renal dysfunction or failure.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which may increase the risk of hyperglycemic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias.

Given the patient's condition, it is recommended to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance closely. Additionally, the patient's comfort care plan should be reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure that their needs are being met."

 COMFORT CARE ([**Telephone/Fax (3) 617**], COMFORT MEASURES)
   This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT [**2121**]
   complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
   obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who
   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # Goal of care: Based on the patient
s deteriorating clinical status, a
   decision was made with his sister to focus on comfort and not advance
   further, including the withdrawal of pressors upon her arrival.
   All other issues are ongoing but will not be actively addressed:
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in 30
s. Minimal stool output now.
   - continue PO and PR vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline
 already
   received IVIG; increase metronidazole to q6h
   - pressor as needed to maintain BP and urine output
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - re-check blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c bactrim, voriconazole, azithro per ID; continue acyclovir, tobra
   inh
   - KUB
   - discuss goal of care as below
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.7 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   - consider changing IV voriconazole to po
   - wil check voriconazole level
   #. Hyponatermia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatermia from ARF and poor
   UOP.
   -- cont to trend
   -- urine lytes
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - hold mycophenolate mofetil; discussed with oncology

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 COMFORT CARE ([**Telephone/Fax (3) 617**], COMFORT MEASURES)
   This is a 58 year-old male with a history of CML s/p BMT [**2121**]
   complicated by GVHD, h/o PE & DVT, bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis
   obliterans related to GVHD, intermittent ventilator dependence who
   presents from [**Hospital 630**] Rehab with hypotension, found to have C. diff
   colitis.
   # Goal of care: Based on the patient
s deteriorating clinical status, a
   decision was made with his sister to focus on comfort and not advance
   further, including the withdrawal of pressors upon her arrival.
   All other issues are ongoing but will not be actively addressed:
   # C. diff colitis with septic shock - Patient is requiring escalating
   dose of norepinephrine. With oliguria. Abd CT [**2125-1-2**] showed no perf.
   Family declined surgery. IVIG and tigecycline added yesterday. WBC
   still very elevated in 30
s. Minimal stool output now.
   - continue PO and PR vancomycin, metronidazole, tigecycline
 already
   received IVIG; increase metronidazole to q6h
   - pressor as needed to maintain BP and urine output
   - continue stress-dose steroids
   - re-check blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c bactrim, voriconazole, azithro per ID; continue acyclovir, tobra
   inh
   - KUB
   - discuss goal of care as below
   #. Acute Kidney Injury: Pt Cr 1.5 on admission. baseline of 0.7-0.9.
   Improved to 1.2 with IVF, but slowly increasing to 2.7 today. Likely
   poor renal perfusion due to intravascular depletion, also in setting of
   high intraabdominal pressure. Makes about 10 cc of urine per hour.
   - treat shock as above
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend creatinine
   - consider changing IV voriconazole to po
   - wil check voriconazole level
   #. Hyponatermia: Likely hypervolemic hyponatermia from ARF and poor
   UOP.
   -- cont to trend
   -- urine lytes
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now has volume overload in addition to baseline
   intermittently ventilator dependent.  He underwent trach on last
   admission due to hypoxia. Pt settings at OSH were AC Vt:600, RR:20,
   FiO2: 60%, PEEP:5.
   - cont current ventilator setting and wean O2 as tolerated
   - infectious workup for respiratory source as above
   - cont outpt nebs
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD
   - hold mycophenolate mofetil; discussed with oncology
   - hydrocort to q8h
   - change prophylactic regimen as above
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:  He has had multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - hold enoxaparin, switch to hep gtt given possible surgery
   # Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of PAF. Currently in
   sinus.
   - continue PRN metoprolol
   - pt on lovenox for anti-coagulation
   # Opiate requirement:  has previously required high doses of narcotics,

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns are noted:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever of 102.4°F, which is concerning for infection, particularly given the patient's history of C. diff colitis and septic shock.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and treatment.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed AKI, which is likely due to poor renal perfusion caused by intravascular depletion and high intra-abdominal pressure.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely due to hypervolemic hyponatremia from ARF and poor urine output.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has developed respiratory failure, which is likely due to volume overload and baseline intermittently ventilator-dependent condition.
6. Chronic GVHD: The patient has chronic GVHD, which is a complication of bone marrow transplantation.
7. History of PE and DVT: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, which increases the risk of further thrombotic events.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm.
9. Opiate Requirement: The patient has a history of requiring high doses of narcotics, which is concerning for potential withdrawal symptoms.
10. Depression/Anxiety: The patient is being treated for depression and anxiety, which may impact their mental status and overall well-being.

Based on these complications and concerns, the following potential medical complications may arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the ongoing infection and septic shock.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory arrest or death.
4. Thrombotic Events: The patient's history of PE and DVT increases the risk of further thrombotic events, which could lead to life-threatening complications.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's depression and anxiety may worsen if not managed properly, leading to changes in mental status and potential harm to the patient.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly given their compromised immune system and ongoing septic shock.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's C. diff colitis may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is currently in septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) secondary to severe Clostridioides difficile (Cdiff) colitis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.4°F
* Heart rate: 105 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 89/20 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 96%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, but it was discontinued this morning. He is also receiving vasopressors, which were stopped earlier today. The patient's tracheostomy tube is in place, and he is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 35.0-43.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.4-31.7%
* Platelet count: 138-324 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3-2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15-102 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 138-129 mmol/L, potassium 2.8-5.1 mmol/L, chloride 78-102 mmol/L
* Blood glucose: 117-140 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* No acute distress
* Tracheostomy tube in place
* Unassessable peripheral pulses and skin examination
* Neurologic examination is deferred due to the patient's condition

The patient's current diagnosis is septic shock and MOD secondary to Cdiff colitis, and his condition is being managed with comfort care measures. The plan is to titrate up morphine for tachypnea and respiratory distress, and to provide minimal secretions. The family is at the bedside, and the patient's code status is comfort measures only.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's septic shock and MOD
* Development of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
* Infection or sepsis from the patient's indwelling devices or lines
* Cardiovascular instability or cardiac arrest
* Neurological complications due to the patient's underlying condition or medication use

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to continue to monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely to adjust his care plan accordingly."

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with the ICU Fellow, whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 58 y/o man with a
   history of CML s/p BMT presented with septic shock and respiratory
   failure from severe C. difficile colitis.  Ongoing discussions with the
   patient and his family have led to a progressive move toward
   comfort-focused care.  His vasopressors had been discontinued, and this
   morning mechanical ventilation was discontinued.  He continues on
   morphine infusion, which has been escalated to help control his
   tachypnea.  On exam, he is mildly tachycardic (100s) and is breathing
   in the 20s with some retractions.  He does not appear distressed.  We
   will titrate morphine to keep respiratory rate at 25 or below; some
   challenges with this given his prior longstanding narcotic needs, so
   liberalizing his range.  Requires ICU care for medication titration
   until we ensure that he has adequate comfort.  Consider humidified air.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 593**] and I met with several members of his family, and all
   questions were answered.  Critically ill: 35 min

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname **] with the ICU Fellow, whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 58 y/o man with a
   history of CML s/p BMT presented with septic shock and respiratory
   failure from severe C. difficile colitis.  Ongoing discussions with the
   patient and his family have led to a progressive move toward
   comfort-focused care.  His vasopressors had been discontinued, and this
   morning mechanical ventilation was discontinued.  He continues on
   morphine infusion, which has been escalated to help control his
   tachypnea.  On exam, he is mildly tachycardic (100s) and is breathing
   in the 20s with some retractions.  He does not appear distressed.  We
   will titrate morphine to keep respiratory rate at 25 or below; some
   challenges with this given his prior longstanding narcotic needs, so
   liberalizing his range.  Requires ICU care for medication titration
   until we ensure that he has adequate comfort.  Consider humidified air.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 593**] and I met with several members of his family, and all
   questions were answered.  Critically ill: 35 min

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is currently suffering from severe C. difficile colitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient is unable to provide a history due to being unresponsive.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Heart rate: 105-130 bpm
* Blood pressure: 89/20-94/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33-40 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Temperature: 102.4°F

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which was discontinued this morning, and is being treated with vasopressors, which were stopped. He is also receiving morphine infusion, which has been escalated to help control his tachypnea.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 35.0-43.1 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.4-31.7%
* Platelet count: 138-324 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3-2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15-102 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* LDH: 203 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's assessment is that he is critically ill and requires comfort-focused care. The plan is to titrate up morphine to control his tachypnea and respiratory distress, and to provide minimal secretions. The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and he is expected to remain in the ICU for further care.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypotension
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Neurological complications

Given the patient's severe C. difficile colitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."
