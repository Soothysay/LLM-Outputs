   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  Patient is an 80 y.o. man with pmh significant
   for systolic and diastolic CHF, ESRD, p/w dyspnea, hypoxia, and
   hypotension.
   #)Dyspnea/Hypoxia:Likely CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. CXR
   with bilateral infiltrates, BNP 38,000 on admission. Echo unchanged,
   ekg unchanged.  Cardiac enzymes negative. Entire body is edemetous.
   patient has been going to hemodialysis regularly but many of these
   sessions have been discontinued early secondary to hypotension. he
   likely became progressively fluid overloaded with insufficient HD.
   CVVH began [**10-26**].
   -albuterol, ipratropium nebs.
   -IV morphine
   -continue digoxin
   -continue CVVH
   -consider therapeutic thoracentesis, patient currently refusing.
   .
   #)Hypotension: Likely from low intravascular volume from
   hypoalbuminemia, in addition to side effects of anti-hypertensive
   medications.  Currently on levophed, unable goal is to keep MAP > 60.
   Will hold antihypertensive medications and try to wean off dopamine.
   Will also get central venous sat to determine if this is secondary to
   sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock.  Got a one time dose of ceftriaxone
   [**10-27**], for possible sepsis.
   -Hold metoprolol
   -Hold amiodarone
   -wean off levophed
   -f/u cultures
   -continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin
   .
   #)Chest Pain: ekg without ischemic changes and unchanged from prior.
   Chest tightness likely from pulmonary edema.  patient does have pmh of
   CAD, and so will continue with morphine and SL Nitro.
   -IV morphine
   -SL Nitroglycerin
   -trend enzymes
   .
   #)GI bleeding: Not currently bleeding, hematocrit is stable. holding
   anticoagulation.
   .
   #)Afib: Holding metorpolol and amiodarone in setting of hypotension.
   will continue with digoxin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 80-year-old man, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including systolic and diastolic CHF, ESRD, and CAD. He is currently in the ICU due to a likely CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and hypotension. He has been receiving hemodialysis, but many sessions have been discontinued early due to hypotension. CVVH was initiated to manage fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/56 mmHg. He is on oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula and ABG values of 7.43/40/153/26/2.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs, abdominal ascites, and left lower extremity edema. He has a BKA wound that is intact and without drainage.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.6 K/uL
* Hct: 30.6%
* Plt: 156 K/uL
* Cr: 3.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.26 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27 mmHg
* Glucose: 200 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.2/36.5/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 40/5/0.26, Differential-Neuts: 90.2%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 5.7%, Mono: 3.0%, Eos: 0.9%, Albumin: 3.2 g/dL, Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral crackles in the lungs and hypoxia. He may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, but he has a history of CAD and CHF. He may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including AFib.
3. Sepsis: The patient received a dose of ceftriaxone for possible sepsis, and his WBC count is elevated. He may be at risk for septic shock.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and is on anticoagulation therapy. He may be at risk for further bleeding.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is on vasopressors. He may be at risk for further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
6. Fluid overload: The patient has been fluid overloaded, and CVVH is being used to manage this. He may be at risk for further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of UTI and has received antibiotics. He may be at risk for further infections, including pneumonia and sepsis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue CVVH
* Wean off levophed and try to maintain a MAP > 60
* Hold antihypertensive medications
* Continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin
* Consider therapeutic thoracentesis
* Continue pain management with IV morphine and SL nitroglycerin
* Continue digoxin
* Hold metoprolol and amiodarone
* Wean off dopamine
* Get central venous sat to determine if hypotension is secondary to sepsis or cardiogenic shock
* F/u cultures
* Trend enzymes
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Continue code status as DNR/DNI
* Disposition to ICU"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to exacerbation of CHF, pulmonary edema, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy, with an SpO2 of 94%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.43, PaO2 of 255, and PaCO2 of 40.
* Cardiovascular: He has atrial fibrillation (AF) and is on norepinephrine infusion to support blood pressure.
* Renal: He is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with a calcium gluconate and potassium chloride infusion.
* Neurological: His mental status is not assessed due to delirium.
* Gastrointestinal: He has a history of GI bleeding, but is currently not bleeding and his hematocrit is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on his chest X-ray, which may indicate pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of UTI and is receiving antibiotics, which may lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has AF, and may be at risk for other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he may require mechanical ventilation.
5. Renal failure: The patient is on CRRT, and may be at risk for acute kidney injury or worsening of his chronic kidney disease.
6. GI bleeding: Although the patient is not currently bleeding, he has a history of GI bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter and may be at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he may be at risk for cardiovascular instability.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan of care includes:

1. Continuing CRRT to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Weaning off dopamine infusion and holding antihypertensive medications to support blood pressure.
3. Continuing antibiotics for possible UTI.
4. Considering therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve pulmonary edema.
5. Consulting pain and palliative care services to manage the patient's symptoms.
6. Discussing goals of care with the patient and his family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, ESRD, DM, CHF, colon CA, and prostate CA, who presented with cardiogenic shock, hypotension, and shortness of breath. He was started on dopamine and later transitioned to levophed to maintain blood pressure. He is currently receiving CVVH and has been on NIMV and NRB. The patient's cardiogenic shock is likely related to CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. He is also experiencing leukocytosis, dyspnea, and chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: Although the patient's septic shock is unclear, it is essential to remain vigilant and monitor for any signs of sepsis.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema may worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammation, which needs to be investigated and managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires continued pressor support to maintain blood pressure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may require further management, and the holding of anti-HTN meds may need to be reassessed.
6. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD requires continued dialysis, and the CVVH is currently being used to manage his fluid status.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed appropriately, and the use of NIMV and NRB may need to be continued.
8. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and chest pain may be signs of an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiogenic shock and adjust pressor support as needed.
2. Investigate the patient's leukocytosis and chest pain to determine the underlying cause.
3. Manage the patient's pulmonary edema with continued NIMV and NRB, and consider the use of diuretics.
4. Continue the patient's CVVH and adjust as needed to manage his fluid status.
5. Consider the use of antibiotics to treat any potential infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac arrhythmias and adjust management as needed.
7. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust management as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He is currently in cardiogenic shock and has been treated with dopamine and levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, shortness of breath, and chest pain. He has been on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and has required multiple doses of albuterol and ipratropium nebs. He has also been given IV morphine and has had his digoxin continued.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.6 and a hematocrit (Hct) of 30.6. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. His troponin-T level is 0.26, which is elevated, suggesting cardiac injury.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal S1 and S2 heart sound, but his peripheral vascular examination is limited due to his right below-the-knee amputation (BKA). His respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion and no wheezing or rhonchi.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's continued pressor requirement and the presence of PVCs on telemetry suggest that he may be at risk for further cardiac complications.
2. ESRD: The patient's elevated BUN and Cr levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which may require dialysis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBC count may indicate an infection, which could worsen his condition.
4. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath and hypoxia may be related to his CHF exacerbation and pulmonary edema.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low intravascular volume from hypoalbuminemia may contribute to his hypotension, which may worsen his cardiac condition.
6. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain may be related to his CHF exacerbation or pulmonary edema, and may require further evaluation.
7. Afib: The patient's atrial fibrillation may contribute to his cardiac complications and may require further management.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue pressor support to maintain a MAP greater than 60 mmHg.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to treat the patient's CHF exacerbation with IV morphine, albuterol, and ipratropium nebs.
4. Consider dialysis for the patient's ESRD.
5. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation for infection.
6. Consider further evaluation for the patient's chest pain, including a chest X-ray and cardiac enzymes.
7. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider further management.

In conclusion, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of CAD, ESRD, DM, and CHF who is currently in cardiogenic shock. He has been treated with dopamine and levophed to maintain a MAP greater than 60 mmHg and has been given IV morphine and digoxin. The patient's potential medical complications include cardiogenic shock, ESRD, leukocytosis, dyspnea/hypoxia, hypotension, chest pain, and Afib. Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is currently in the ICU with CHF exacerbation, hypotension, and pulmonary edema. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 105/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has been weaned off levophed. His lab results show mild anemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema
	* Atrial fibrillation (Afib)
	* Cardiac enzymes negative
2. Renal Complications:
	* End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
	* Hypotension and fluid overload
	* CVVH treatment
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pulmonary edema
	* Hypoxia
	* Respiratory failure
4. Infections:
	* UTI (urinary tract infection) with ESBL E. coli
	* Bacterial cultures pending
5. Bleeding Complications:
	* GI bleeding (gastrointestinal bleeding)
	* Thrombocytopenia
	* Platelet count recovering
6. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Hypotension
	* Cardiac arrhythmias (Afib)
	* Cardiac enzymes negative
7. Neurological Complications:
	* Confusion and delirium
	* No neurological examination performed

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan includes:

* Continue CVVH and wean off levophed
* Treat UTI with Augmentin
* Hold metoprolol and amiodarone
* Continue digoxin
* Monitor cardiac enzymes and arrhythmias
* Manage respiratory failure with oxygen therapy and respiratory support
* Monitor for bleeding complications and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed
* Consider heme consult for thrombocytopenia
* Monitor for neurological complications and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed
* Continue to monitor and manage the patient's overall condition in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 80 y.o. man with pmh significant for systolic and
   diastolic CHF, ESRD, p/w dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension.
   #)Dyspnea/Hypoxia:Likely CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. CXR
   with bilateral infiltrates, BNP 38,000 on admission. Echo unchanged,
   ekg unchanged.  Cardiac enzymes negative. Entire body is edemetous.
   patient has been going to hemodialysis regularly but many of these
   sessions have been discontinued early secondary to hypotension. he
   likely became progressively fluid overloaded with insufficient HD.
   CVVH began [**10-26**].
   -albuterol, ipratropium nebs.
   -IV morphine
   -continue digoxin
   -continue CVVH
   #)Hypotension: Likely from low intravascular volume from
   hypoalbuminemia, in addition to side effects of anti-hypertensive
   medications.  Currently on levophed, unable goal is to keep MAP > 60.
   Will hold antihypertensive medications and try to wean off dopamine.
   Will also get central venous sat to determine if this is secondary to
   sepsis vs. cardiogenic shock.  Got a one time dose of ceftriaxone
   [**10-27**], for possible sepsis.
   -Hold metoprolol
   -Hold amiodarone
   -wean off levophed
   -f/u cultures
   -continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin
   #)Chest Pain: ekg without ischemic changes and unchanged from prior.
   Chest tightness likely from pulmonary edema.  patient does have pmh of
   CAD, and so will continue with morphine and SL Nitro.
   -IV morphine
   -SL Nitroglycrin
   -trend enzymes
   #)H/O GI bleeding: Not currently bleeding, hematocrit is stable.
   holding anticoagulation.
   #)Afib: Holding metorpolol and amiodarone in setting of hypotension.
   will continue with digoxin.
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen
   #) FEN: low salt diet diet as tolerated
   #) Access: Right EJ, left midline, right tunneled HD cartheter.
   #) Code Status: DNR/DNI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension, and was found to have bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 38,000. His cardiac enzymes were negative, and his electrocardiogram (EKG) showed atrial fibrillation (AF). He has been on hemodialysis regularly, but many sessions have been discontinued early due to hypotension. He was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) on [**10-26**].

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.1°C, HR 84 bpm, BP 105/67 mmHg, RR 14 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen therapy
* Cardiac status: AF, with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 74%
* Renal status: On CVVH, with a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 16 mmHg, MAP 105 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total in 6,809 mL, total out 9,048 mL, with a net balance of -2,239 mL

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ CHF exacerbation
	+ Pulmonary edema
	+ Cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	+ Pneumonia
* Renal complications:
	+ Acute kidney injury (AKI)
	+ Chronic kidney disease progression
* Infectious complications:
	+ Sepsis
	+ MRSA infection (pending culture results)
* Hemodynamic complications:
	+ Hypotension
	+ Low intravascular volume
* Gastrointestinal complications:
	+ GI bleeding
* Neurological complications:
	+ Confusion/delirium

Plan:

* Continue CVVH and monitor for signs of improvement or deterioration
* Wean off dopamine and levophed, and consider alternative vasopressors
* Continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin for possible sepsis
* Monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia and consider stress testing
* Continue pain management with morphine and SL Nitroglycrin
* Consider palliative care consult for symptom control and goals of care discussion
* Monitor for signs of GI bleeding and consider holding anticoagulation
* Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Monitor for signs of hypotension and consider holding antihypertensive medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* White blood cell count: 9.6
* Hematocrit: 27.3%
* Platelet count: 132
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 163 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Augmentin for 10-day course to treat ESBL E. coli
* Digoxin
* Heparin (held due to thrombocytopenia)
* Metoprolol and amiodarone (held due to hypotension)
* PPI for prophylaxis
* Bowel regimen for prophylaxis
* Pneumoboots for prophylaxis

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Continued hypotension and potential cardiovascular instability
* Respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis and potential organ dysfunction
* Thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding complications
* GI bleeding and potential need for transfusion
* Pneumonia and potential respiratory failure
* DVT and potential pulmonary embolism
* Stress ulcer and potential GI bleeding
* VAP and potential respiratory failure

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue digoxin and monitor for cardiovascular instability
* Start Augmentin for 10-day course to treat ESBL E. coli
* Hold metoprolol and amiodarone due to hypotension
* Monitor for thrombocytopenia and potential bleeding complications
* Consider restarting amiodarone after hemodialysis
* Continue prophylactic measures for GI bleeding, DVT, and VAP
* Monitor for glycemic control and adjust as necessary
* Consider restarting hemodialysis today"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 80 y.o. man with pmh significant for systolic and
   diastolic CHF, ESRD, p/w dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension.
   #)ACUTE ON CHRONIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
   CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. CXR with bilateral infiltrates,
   BNP 38,000 on admission. Echo unchanged, ekg unchanged.  Cardiac
   enzymes negative. Entire body is edemetous. patient has been going to
   hemodialysis regularly but many of these sessions have been
   discontinued early secondary to hypotension. he likely became
   progressively fluid overloaded with insufficient HD.  CVVH began [**10-26**].
   -albuterol, ipratropium nebs.
   -IV morphine
   -continue digoxin
   -continue CVVH
   #UTI
   - Unable to get sample here prior to abx, but followed up [**Hospital1 723**] sample
   from [**10-20**] during which he had low grade no overt fevers and the
   hypotension, this grew ESBL e.coli sensitive to augmentin. Prior U/As
   without organisms.
   - Start Augmentin for 10d course to treat
   #)HYPOTENSION: Possibly related to sepsis and poor oncotic pressure
   - treat UTI as above
   -Hold metoprolol, -Hold amiodarone
   -weaned off levophed
   -f/u cultures
   #)Chest Pain: ekg without ischemic changes and unchanged from prior.
   Chest tightness likely from pulmonary edema.  patient does have pmh of
   CAD, and so will continue with morphine and SL Nitro.
   -IV morphine
   -SL Nitroglycrin
   #)H/O GI bleeding: Not currently bleeding, hematocrit is stable.
   holding anticoagulation.
   #) Thrombocytopenia
   - PLTs recovering. HIT PF4 ab negative x2 in [**Month (only) 705**]. ?illness, immune
   mediation, or splenic sequestration
   - Defer restarting heparin for now; consider heme consult. Pneumoboots
   for ppx.
   #)Afib: Holding metorpolol and amiodarone in setting of hypotension.
   will continue with digoxin.
   #) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen
   #) FEN: low salt diet diet as tolerated
   #) Access: Right EJ, left midline, right tunneled HD cartheter.
   #) Code Status: DNR/DNI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypotension. He has been treated with CVVH and has been on hemodialysis regularly, but many sessions have been discontinued early due to hypotension.

The patient has been experiencing dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension, and has a white blood cell count of 9.6 with a significant increase in absolute neutrophils. His cardiac enzymes are negative, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram are unchanged.

The patient has been treated with augmentin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by ESBL e.coli, which was sensitive to the antibiotic. He has also been treated with IV morphine for chest pain and has been weaned off levophed.

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) 7.6 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt) 132
* Creatinine (Cr) 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 154 mg/dL
* Glucose 163 mg/dL
* Potassium (K+) 4.3 mEq/L
* Calcium (Ca++) 9.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++) 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4) 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate 94 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure 102/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation 100%

The patient has been assessed to have the following potential medical complications:

1. Acute on chronic congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema
2. UTI caused by ESBL e.coli
3. Hypotension possibly related to sepsis and poor oncotic pressure
4. Chest pain likely due to pulmonary edema
5. Thrombocytopenia
6. Afib
7. Potential for GI bleeding
8. DVT prophylaxis
9. Stress ulcer prophylaxis
10. VAP prophylaxis

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue CVVH
2. Continue digoxin
3. Start augmentin for 10-day course to treat UTI
4. Hold metoprolol and amiodarone
5. Wean off levophed
6. Continue IV morphine for chest pain
7. Continue SL Nitroglycrin for chest pain
8. Hold anticoagulation
9. Defer restarting heparin for now
10. Consider heme consult
11. Pneumoboots for prophylaxis
12. Low salt diet as tolerated
13. Right EJ, left midline, right tunneled HD catheter
14. DNR/DNI code status
15. Disposition: CVVH for another day, change to HD likely tomorrow as he is off levophed."
