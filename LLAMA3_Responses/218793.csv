You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with an unresponsive state. The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, and administration of antibiotics.

Physiological parameters indicate that the patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/54 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show a mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL. The white blood cell count is within normal limits, and the platelet count is slightly low at 62 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a serum potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L and a serum sodium level of 127 mEq/L.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with an unresponsive state and no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic functions. The patient's abdomen is also tender, with a reported gastrointestinal bleed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's antibiotic administration and laboratory results suggest a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's reported gastrointestinal bleed can lead to hemorrhagic shock and other complications.
3. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is slightly low, which can be a sign of underlying illness or inadequate warming.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation suggest possible respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's underlying condition.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's unresponsive state and lack of assessment of neurological functions suggest possible neurological deterioration, which can be a sign of underlying brain injury or infection.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and elevated troponin-T level suggest possible coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and optimize treatment outcomes."

 HYPOTHERMIA
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - avoid flumazenil because it lowers seizure threshold
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - follow up final read CT head
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   .
   # Respiratory Status: is protecting airway right now but is tenuous
   with poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate to 8.  She is
   satting well on 3L NC right now.
   - monitor for now, if mental status worsening, consider intubation
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.

   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, hypothermia, and respiratory depression. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), and has undergone recent treatment with antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem. She is being treated with norepinephrine infusion and has a PICC line and arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, with a depressed respiratory rate and poor gag reflex. She is at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if her mental status worsens.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and is at risk for new infections, particularly in the setting of altered mental status. She is being treated empirically with vancomycin, and further diagnostic testing, including diagnostic paracentesis, may be necessary.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and is at risk for worsening encephalopathy, particularly if her liver function continues to decline.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has new-onset hyponatremia, which may be secondary to diuretic use or SIADH. She is at risk for worsening hyponatremia, particularly if her diuretic therapy is continued.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to liver disease or HIT. She is at risk for bleeding, particularly if her platelet count continues to decline.
6. Ascites/LE Edema: The patient has a history of ascites and LE edema, which may worsen if her liver function continues to decline.
7. HIV-related complications: The patient has HIV, which may be complicated by opportunistic infections or other HIV-related conditions.
8. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizures, which may be secondary to underlying organic seizure disorder or liver failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if her mental status worsens.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infection empirically with vancomycin and consider diagnostic paracentesis.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function closely and consider further diagnostic testing, including a liver biopsy.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hyponatremia with fluid restriction and consider further treatment, such as hypertonic saline.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and consider transfusion if it continues to decline.
6. Consider further diagnostic testing, including an MRI, to evaluate the patient's seizure disorder.
7. Continue to manage the patient's ascites and LE edema with diuretic therapy and consider further treatment, such as paracentesis.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's HIV-related complications and consider further treatment, such as antiretroviral therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
 HYPOTHERMIA
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - follow up final read CT head
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: is protecting airway right now but is tenuous
   with poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate to 8.  She is
   satting well on 3L NC right now.
   - monitor for now, if mental status worsening, intubated
   - consider bronchoscopy today
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / NPO for now, consider
   nutrition consult for TF
   # PPX: PPI (now changed to IV), pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, and HIV. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypothermia, and hyponatremia. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of seizures, and it is unclear whether they are secondary to liver failure, an underlying organic disorder, or the medication ciprofloxacin. She is also experiencing respiratory distress, with a poor gag reflex and depressed respiratory rate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypothermia may be indicative of an underlying infection. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for suspected sepsis, and a diagnostic paracentesis may be necessary to determine the source of the infection.
2. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of seizures is unclear, and it is uncertain whether they are secondary to liver failure, an underlying organic disorder, or the medication ciprofloxacin. The patient is receiving anticonvulsant medication, and an EEG and MRI may be necessary to determine the cause of the seizures.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her altered mental status and depressed respiratory rate. She is receiving mechanical ventilation, and a bronchoscopy may be necessary to determine the cause of her respiratory distress.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be secondary to diuretic use, SIADH, or liver disease. Fluid restriction and electrolyte supplementation may be necessary to correct the hyponatremia.
5. Liver failure: The patient's Hepatitis C cirrhosis and Hepato-Renal Syndrome may be progressing, and liver transplantation may be necessary to improve her prognosis.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be secondary to liver disease, and platelet transfusions may be necessary to correct the thrombocytopenia.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to chronic blood loss, and transfusions may be necessary to correct the anemia.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.

   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process. Possibly
   secondary to bacteremia as below.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process. Possibly
   secondary to bacteremia as below.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / NPO for now, consider

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and shock.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated bilirubin levels, indicating cholestasis
* Elevated liver enzymes, indicating liver damage
* Low platelet count, indicating thrombocytopenia
* Elevated creatinine levels, indicating kidney damage
* Elevated INR, indicating coagulopathy
* Low albumin levels, indicating malnutrition

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Vasopressin for shock
* Levophed for pressure support
* Vancomycin for SBP
* Meropenem for suspected ESBL UTI
* Gabapentin for seizures
* Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
* Ativan for sedation
* Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis

The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to altered mental status and respiratory depression. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her airway is at risk due to mucous plugging and bronchoscopy.

The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with signs of shock and hypotension. Her blood pressure is 100/56 mmHg, and her heart rate is 89 bpm.

The patient's laboratory results also indicate hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 135 mg/dL. Her fluid balance is negative, with a total input of 3,576 mL and a total output of 560 mL.

The patient's medical team is concerned about the following potential complications:

* Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and is at risk for new infections, particularly in the setting of altered mental status.
* Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for new seizures due to the use of ciprofloxacin.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is at risk for respiratory failure.
* Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, and her hemodynamic status is unstable.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy and is at risk for worsening encephalopathy due to the use of lactulose.
* Cholestasis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating cholestasis.

The patient's medical team is considering the following interventions:

* Infectious workup, including blood cultures and urine cultures
* Diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the patient's ascites
* EEG to evaluate the patient's seizure disorder
* MRI when stable to evaluate the patient's liver and brain
* Nutrition consult to evaluate the patient's nutritional needs
* Liver transplant evaluation to consider the patient's liver transplant options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports.
   - IVF boluses prn, continue levophed for pressure support.  Add
   vasopressin as needed.
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia, but did not have a swift fall
   in Na today. Head CT with no evidence for acute process.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - d/c cipro bc it also lower seizure threshold
   - follow up neuro recs
   - consider MRI if stable for transport
   - if more awake, trial of lactulose, if still somnulent would consider
   intubation and NGT for lactulose trial
   - infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis later
   - Avoid ativan as it will be cleared/metabolized slowly
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue gabapentin, but hold for mental status
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected
   - started vanco [**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant
   - lactulose when PO access
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider ceftriaxone for ppx
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # ARF: resolved, was thought most likely secondary to hepatorenal
   syndrome initially.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and a recent history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, respiratory compromise, and various laboratory abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of SBP and is currently on antibiotics, which may not be effective against the underlying infection. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ failure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a history of respiratory compromise. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections can worsen her respiratory status, leading to further respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of Hepato-Renal Syndrome and is currently experiencing acute kidney injury. This can lead to further deterioration of her renal function and potentially require dialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen her altered mental status and potentially lead to further neurological complications.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has developed hyponatremia, which can worsen her neurological symptoms and potentially lead to seizures or coma.
6. Infections: The patient has a history of SBP and is currently on antibiotics. She may be at risk for further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities:

* Hyponatremia (sodium level of 135 mg/dL)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Elevated bilirubin level
* Elevated creatinine level
* Low platelet count
* Elevated white blood cell count
* Elevated lactate level

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* IV antibiotics for suspected sepsis
* Vasopressin to support blood pressure
* Fluid restriction to manage hyponatremia
* Lactulose to manage hepatic encephalopathy
* Albumin to manage liver disease
* Octreotide to manage liver disease
* Midodrine to manage liver disease
* EEG and MRI to evaluate for underlying neurological disorders
* Seizure precautions to manage seizure risk

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia, and cardiovascular complications. Her treatment plan should be carefully monitored and adjusted as needed to manage these risks and improve her clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with oliguric urine output ranging from 10-45ml/hour. They have been started on hypertonic saline 3% at 40ml/hour to correct hyponatremia and potential cerebral edema. The patient has undergone bronchoscopy with mucous plug removal yesterday.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89bpm, and blood pressure of 100/56mmHg. The patient is receiving vasopressin infusion at 2.4 units/hour and has been on ventilatory support with PSV/SBT mode. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 13insp/min and SpO2 of 96%.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.8g/dL
* Platelet count: 102K/uL
* White blood cell count: 6.6K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4mg/dL
* Sodium: 135mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.2mEq/L
* Glucose: 93mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4mmol/L

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, penicillins, and Bactrim, and has been taking vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for prolonged ventilatory support.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguric urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest a risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of pre-existing kidney disease.
* Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest a risk of sepsis, particularly given the patient's history of antibiotic use.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium and potassium levels are within normal range, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of hypertonic saline.
* Cerebral edema: The patient's hyponatremia and potential cerebral edema may increase the risk of cerebral edema, which could lead to neurological complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's ICU stay may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload (more congestion on CXR today)
   - check CVP, check ScV02
   - Currently on vasopressin
 will hold for now and monitor BPs
   .
   # Altered mental status: unclear etiology although leading diagnosis is
   likely post-ictal with slow metabolism or 2mg ativan this morning.
   Other etiologies could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, although
   had 7 BMs yesterday and was taking her lactulose.  Missed her PM dose
   because of excessive BMs and then did not take anything by mouth this
   morning.  Could be secondary to infection.  Could be status
   epilecticus.  Could be from hyponatremia. Head CT with no evidence for
   acute process. Possibly secondary to bacteremia as below. Also concern
   for cerebral edema.
   - continue to monitor closely for respiratory depression
   - follow up neuro recs
   - F/U infectious workup with blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if enough ascites to tap
   - Avoid ativan and other sedatives
   .
   # Respiratory Status: Intubated with concern over airway protection.
   - Currently undergoing spontaneous breathing trial (seems going well)
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Abx with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - f/u neuro recs: off meds at this time
   - seizure precautions
   - EEG
   - MRI when stable
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current MELD =
   31.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD = 31 today.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabalized.
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / plan to start TF today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), and hypothermia. The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder is managed with hypertonic saline, and vasopressin was stopped due to concern for contributing to hyponatremia. Levophed is used to maintain blood pressure. The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant. The patient's renal function is likely acute kidney injury (ARF) due to prerenal or hepatorenal syndrome. Liver function is compromised, and the patient does not require antifungal treatment. The patient's neuro status is monitored with 24-hour EEG and repeat head CT. The patient has poor urine output overnight and requires ongoing fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's head CT shows no signs of cerebral edema, but if the patient develops cerebral edema, the pharmacy has a protocol for treatment.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's vasopressin was stopped due to concern for contributing to hyponatremia, and hypertonic saline is being used to manage electrolyte imbalance.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant, but it could also indicate sepsis.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is likely ARF due to prerenal or hepatorenal syndrome, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalance, and acidosis.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, which can lead to coagulopathy, ascites, and encephalopathy.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can worsen if not managed properly, which can lead to respiratory acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and ongoing fluid management is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
8. Sepsis-Induced Cardiac Failure: The patient's sepsis can lead to cardiac failure, which can result in cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and decreased cardiac output.
9. GI Bleed: The patient's GI bleed can worsen if not managed properly, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalance, and coagulopathy."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Vasopressin stopped over concern for contribution to hyponatremia.
   Levophed continued to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/mg.
   - Blood cx positive from [**2200-4-27**] speciated to coagulase negative staph.
   As this was 1/4 bottles, thought to be possibly a contaminant.
   Continuing to treat through existing PICC line (though would pull line
   if 2nd bottle positive).
   - Renal recs: ARF likely [**2-25**] prerenal vs. HRS. Given weak response to
   hypertonic saline, consider D/C or change vasopressin. No indication
   for RTT at this time. If metabolic acidosis worsens, may need HD.
   - Liver recs: Continue hypertonic saline, current mgmt (including
   current Abx, hypertonic saline). Pt does not require antifungal
   treatment
   - Neuro recs: 24-hour EEG, repeat head CT
   - Somewhat poor UOP overnight (20-60 cc/hr)
   - Repeat head CT: (prelim read) no cerebral edema (should patient
   develop cerebral edema, pharmacy provided protocol for treatment which
   is in patient's chart)
   - Started on TF
   - Needs to have family meeting scheduled to discuss goals of care
   - Na trended up appropriately with hypertonic saline to 136

   Studies:
   CT HEAD ([**4-29**] (wet-read):  No evidence intracranial hemorrhage
   EEG ([**4-27**]) This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing,
   disorganization, and attenuation of the background consistent with a
   moderate to severe encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
   disturbances, or infection are common causes. No focal areas of
   slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen
   during this recording.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02
   - continue levophed to MAP >60
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin will need ID
   approval)
   - F/U final read CT head
   - continue to correct hyponatremia
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**].
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   - If S. aureus, will need PICC changed out; if S. epi could be
   contaminant
 consider treating through if only
 bottle positive
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - f/u final read CT head
   - MRI when stable
   - F/U with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics (concern with
   Keppra due to elevated LFT)
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 24 hours with hypertonic saline.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   - recheck HCT this AM
   -  check stool for microscopic blood
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Vasopressin stopped over concern for contribution to hyponatremia.
   Levophed continued to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/mg.
   - Blood cx positive from [**2200-4-27**] speciated to coagulase negative staph.
   As this was 1/4 bottles, thought to be possibly a contaminant.
   Continuing to treat through existing PICC line (though would pull line
   if 2nd bottle positive).
   - Renal recs: ARF likely [**2-25**] prerenal vs. HRS. Given weak response to
   hypertonic saline, consider D/C or change vasopressin. No indication
   for RTT at this time. If metabolic acidosis worsens, may need HD.
   - Liver recs: Continue hypertonic saline, current mgmt (including
   current Abx, hypertonic saline). Pt does not require antifungal
   treatment
   - Neuro recs: 24-hour EEG, repeat head CT
   - Somewhat poor UOP overnight (20-60 cc/hr)
   - Repeat head CT: (prelim read) no cerebral edema (should patient
   develop cerebral edema, pharmacy provided protocol for treatment which
   is in patient's chart)
   - Started on TF
   - Needs to have family meeting scheduled to discuss goals of care
   - Na trended up appropriately with hypertonic saline to 136

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome (HRS), HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status (AMS) and is currently intubated due to concern for airway protection. The patient has developed hyponatremia, which has been corrected with hypertonic saline, and is at risk for HRS. She also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. HRS: The patient's creatinine has increased from 1.0 to 1.4, and her urine output is low, indicating a high risk of developing HRS.
2. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and the differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, infection, and hyponatremia. A 24-hour EEG and CT head with contrast are recommended to determine the etiology of the seizures.
3. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may be a contaminant or a true infection. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further work-up is needed to determine the source of the infection.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level has been corrected with hypertonic saline, but she is at risk for developing HRS. Close monitoring of her sodium level and fluid status is necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding. Platelet transfusions may be necessary, and consideration should be given to using DDAVP if she is actively bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, and transfusions may be necessary to maintain a hemoglobin level above 25.
7. Liver failure: The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and is at risk for liver failure. Close monitoring of her liver function tests and coagulation studies is necessary.
8. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and she is at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Close monitoring of her creatinine level and urine output is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
2. Perform a 24-hour EEG to determine the etiology of the seizures.
3. Obtain a CT head with contrast to determine the etiology of the seizures.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium level and fluid status closely.
5. Consider platelet transfusions if the patient's platelet count remains low.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse if necessary.
7. Close monitoring of the patient's liver function tests and coagulation studies is necessary.
8. Consider liver transplantation if the patient's liver function continues to deteriorate."

   Studies:
   CT HEAD ([**4-29**] (wet-read):  No evidence intracranial hemorrhage
   EEG ([**4-27**]) This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing,
   disorganization, and attenuation of the background consistent with a
   moderate to severe encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
   disturbances, or infection are common causes. No focal areas of
   slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen
   during this recording.
   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% yesterday)
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Volume-cycled assist control, low tidal volume
 if PaO2 worsens,
   increase PEEP
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG
   - Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin will need ID
   approval)
   - F/U final read CT head
   - continue to correct hyponatremia
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - f/u final read CT head
   - MRI when stable
   - F/U with neuro regarding starting anti-epileptics (concern with
   Keppra due to elevated LFT)
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: has new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 24 hours with hypertonic saline.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold keppra for now
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds.
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   - 1 unit pRBCs today
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down, unclear why; will continue to monitor
   and transfuse for hct <25.
   - recheck HCT this AM
   -  check stool for microscopic blood
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Vasopressin stopped over concern for contribution to hyponatremia.
   Levophed continued to maintain pressures at 0.06 mcg/kg/mg.
   - Blood cx positive from [**2200-4-27**] speciated to coagulase negative staph.
   As this was 1/4 bottles, thought to be possibly a contaminant.
   Continuing to treat through existing PICC line (though would pull line
   if 2nd bottle positive).
   - Renal recs: ARF likely [**2-25**] prerenal vs. HRS. Given weak response to
   hypertonic saline, consider D/C or change vasopressin. No indication
   for RTT at this time. If metabolic acidosis worsens, may need HD.
   - Liver recs: Continue hypertonic saline, current mgmt (including
   current Abx, hypertonic saline). Pt does not require antifungal
   treatment
   - Neuro recs: 24-hour EEG, repeat head CT
   - Somewhat poor UOP overnight (20-60 cc/hr)
   - Repeat head CT: (prelim read) no cerebral edema (should patient
   develop cerebral edema, pharmacy provided protocol for treatment which
   is in patient's chart)
   - Started on TF
   - Needs to have family meeting scheduled to discuss goals of care
   - Na trended up appropriately with hypertonic saline to 136
   - Gave bolus of NS for hypotension/tachycardia 500 cc

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is currently in the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and multiple organ dysfunction. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications. The patient's condition is complicated by hyponatremia, ARF, and liver failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and is at risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. ARF: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4, and she has a history of hepatorenal syndrome, which increases her risk for ARF.
3. Liver failure: The patient has liver cirrhosis and is at risk for liver failure, which can lead to encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is compromised due to her altered mental status.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has seizures and encephalopathy, which can lead to further neurological complications, such as cerebral edema and brain herniation.
6. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and is at risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving vasopressors and has a history of fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac failure and death.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death if not corrected.
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of SBP and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease and is at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the patient's suspected sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust her fluid status accordingly to prevent ARF.
3. Continue to manage the patient's liver failure with medications and close monitoring.
4. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust her respiratory therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her medications and therapy as needed to prevent further neurological complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any imbalances promptly.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust her medications and therapy as needed to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications and therapy as needed to prevent cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure. She has a history of recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her laboratory results show elevated creatinine, bilirubin, and INR, indicating liver and kidney dysfunction. She has also developed hypothermia, hyponatremia, and cholestasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure may be secondary to sepsis, which is a potential complication of her underlying liver and kidney disease.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and seizures may be caused by hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to her underlying liver and kidney disease, as well as her recent SBP.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine and bilirubin levels may indicate the development of hepatorenal syndrome, which is a complication of liver disease.
5. Cholestasis: The patient's cholestasis may be secondary to her underlying liver disease or the use of keppra, which was recently started.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be secondary to her underlying liver disease, diuretic use, or SIADH.
7. Seizures: The patient's seizures may be caused by her underlying liver and kidney disease, as well as her recent SBP.
8. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and seizures may be caused by an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out.
9. Liver Failure: The patient's elevated bilirubin and INR levels may indicate the development of liver failure, which is a potential complication of her underlying liver disease.
10. Kidney Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate the development of kidney failure, which is a potential complication of her underlying kidney disease.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure require immediate attention and management. The patient needs to be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, and respiratory failure. The patient's laboratory results need to be closely monitored for signs of liver and kidney dysfunction. The patient's antibiotics need to be adjusted based on the results of her cultures and the patient's clinical response. The patient's fluid status needs to be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload. The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored to prevent hypotension. The patient's oxygenation needs to be closely monitored to prevent hypoxia."

   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics

   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.

   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive

   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She is being treated in the ICU for altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show evidence of liver failure, kidney failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure disorder: The patient has had multiple seizures, and the etiology is unclear. She may require further evaluation with EEG and MRI to determine the cause.
2. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a low urine output. She may require further treatment with albumin and diuretics to manage her fluid status.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She may require further treatment with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy to manage her respiratory status.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia. She may require further treatment with electrolyte supplements and monitoring to prevent further imbalances.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged INR and may require further treatment with vitamin K and/or fresh frozen plasma to manage her coagulopathy.
6. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture and may require further treatment with antibiotics to manage her infection.
7. Liver failure: The patient has evidence of liver failure, including elevated bilirubin levels and INR. She may require further treatment with lactulose and/or albumin to manage her liver failure.
8. Kidney failure: The patient has evidence of kidney failure, including elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. She may require further treatment with dialysis to manage her kidney failure.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and may require further treatment with platelet transfusions to manage her thrombocytopenia.
10. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is low, and she may require further treatment with warm blankets and/or heating pads to manage her hypothermia.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including liver failure, kidney failure, and electrolyte imbalances. She requires further evaluation with EEG and MRI to determine the cause of her seizures. She also requires further treatment with antibiotics to manage her infection and respiratory failure. Her electrolyte imbalances require further treatment with supplements and monitoring. Her coagulopathy requires further treatment with vitamin K and/or fresh frozen plasma. Her liver failure requires further treatment with lactulose and/or albumin. Her kidney failure requires further treatment with dialysis. Her thrombocytopenia requires further treatment with platelet transfusions. Her hypothermia requires further treatment with warm blankets and/or heating pads."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   -  CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) and seizures. She is currently intubated and sedated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. She has been experiencing hypotension, requiring norepinephrine infusion, and has a history of renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.2-6.6 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 22.6-26.0%
* Plt: 66-62 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.4-1.8 mg/dL
* TCO2: 18-21 mmol/L
* Glucose: 125-145 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.5 g/dL
* LDH: 592 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4: 7.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

* Shock: possibly secondary to sepsis
* Respiratory failure: intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection
* Altered mental status: unclear etiology, with differential including seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced
* Hepatic encephalopathy: possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect
* Renal failure: possibly due to poor renal perfusion, HRS, or prerenal
* Seizures: unclear etiology, possibly secondary to swelling for liver failure or underlying organic seizure disorder
* Hyponatremia: possibly secondary to diuretic use and possible SIADH
* Hypothermia: possibly infected
* Cholestasis: possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect

Potential medical complications that may arise:

* Development of HRS due to poor renal perfusion and hypotension
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and altered mental status
* Further deterioration of liver function leading to worsening encephalopathy and cholestasis
* Development of bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease or aspiration
* Cardiac complications due to underlying cardiovascular disease or hypotension

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely
* Adjust therapy as needed to address the patient's medical complications
* Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a 24-hour EEG, CT head, and MRI, to determine the etiology of the patient's altered mental status and seizures
* Continue to provide supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Consider consultation with a neurologist, gastroenterologist, and infectious disease specialist to further evaluate and manage the patient's medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and recent Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with altered mental status, seizures, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and diuretics.

The patient's current condition is:

* Altered mental status: unclear etiology, possibly due to seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, or medication-induced.
* Respiratory failure: intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. The patient has a picture consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
* Renal failure: creatinine 1.4, likely due to poor renal perfusion, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, or prerenal failure.
* Hyponatremia: resolved with hypertonic saline.
* Hypothermia: possibly infected, empirically treated with vancomycin.
* Hepatitis C cirrhosis: worsening bilirubinemia, possibly due to keppra side effect or worsening liver failure.
* Cholestasis: possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect.
* History of SBP: treated with cipro, and the patient is at risk for new infection.
* History of ESBL UTI: stable, treated with meropenem.
* Ascites/LE Edema: stable, with tense belly and mild peripheral edema.
* HIV: stable, last CD4 count in the 600s.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: the patient is at risk for new infection due to altered mental status, respiratory failure, and history of SBP.
* ARDS: the patient has a picture consistent with ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
* Hepato-Renal Syndrome: the patient has a history of Hepato-Renal Syndrome, which can lead to acute kidney injury and death.
* Hyponatremia: the patient has a history of hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and death.
* Hypothermia: the patient has a history of hypothermia, which can lead to organ failure and death.
* Cholestasis: the patient has a history of cholestasis, which can lead to liver failure and death.
* Seizures: the patient has a history of seizures, which can lead to brain damage and death.

Recommendations:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
* Continue anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis.
* Continue diuretics for fluid management.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider extubation when stable.
* Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and consider correcting hyponatremia.
* Monitor the patient's liver function closely and consider liver transplant evaluation.
* Consider diagnostic paracentesis if the patient has sufficient ascites.
* Consider MRI when the patient is stable.
* Consider AEDs if the patient's seizures are not controlled with current treatment.
* Consider starting albumin and octreotide for liver failure.
* Consider starting midodrine for hypotension.
* Consider starting DDAVP if the patient is actively bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on trough
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She was transferred to the MICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her lab results show elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and INR, and she has a low platelet count. She has a history of ESBL UTI and was treated with meropenem. She has also had a recent episode of SBP and was started on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory failure may be secondary to sepsis, and she is being treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and elevated liver enzymes may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is being monitored and treated with lactulose.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she has a history of Hepato-Renal Syndrome. She is being closely monitored for development of renal failure, and her urine output is being closely monitored.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to her altered mental status and respiratory failure. She may require continued respiratory support.
5. Seizures: The patient has had a recent episode of seizures, and her EEG is showing epileptiform activity. She may require continued anticonvulsant therapy.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is being closely monitored, and she is being treated with hypertonic saline to correct her hyponatremia.
7. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is being closely monitored, and she may require continued treatment for hypothermia.
8. Cholestasis: The patient's bilirubin level is elevated, and she may be at risk for cholestasis. She is being closely monitored for signs of cholestasis.
9. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may lead to complications such as opportunistic infections, and she is being closely monitored for signs of HIV-related illness.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Monitor and treat hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose.
3. Closely monitor urine output and renal function.
4. Continue respiratory support with mechanical ventilation.
5. Continue anticonvulsant therapy for seizures.
6. Monitor and treat hyponatremia with hypertonic saline.
7. Continue treatment for hypothermia.
8. Monitor for signs of cholestasis and consider further treatment if necessary.
9. Closely monitor the patient for signs of HIV-related complications and consider further treatment if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory
   reports. Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - IVF as needed, though would monitor volume status closely to avoid
   fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - check ScV02 (91% on [**4-29**])
   - continue levophed to MAP >60 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging, collapse
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity. Continues minimally
   responsive to pain.
   - 24 hour EEG in progress: prelim read
 epileptiform activity; neuro
   considering starting AED (?zonegran)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out).
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - F/U speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently. MELD score of 33
   this AM.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.7 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV, who is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Shock: The patient appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports, although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5, fluid administration is unlikely to remain intravascular. The patient is being treated with levophed to maintain a MAP >75 PRN.
2. Respiratory: The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. The patient has a picture consistent with ARDS and bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous plugging and collapse. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being monitored closely for respiratory status.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has unclear etiology, with differential including seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced (started following ativan administration). The patient's CT head showed no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema, and EEG was consistent with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.
4. Positive BCx: The patient has a positive blood culture with GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag-negative staph, which could be a contaminant. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem.
5. ARF: The patient has creatinine 1.7 (from baseline 1.0), which is likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. The patient's urine output is low, and the patient is being monitored closely for development of HRS.
6. Seizures: The patient has unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself because of cipro and the wearing off of keppra. The patient is being monitored for seizure activity.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to diuretic use and possible SIADH. The patient's sodium level has resolved at 140 this morning.
8. Hypothermia: The patient possibly infected. The patient is being maintained at a stable body temperature.
9. Hep C Cirrhosis: The patient has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and worsening bilirubinemia. The patient is being evaluated for transplant but is unlikely a candidate given comorbidities.
10. Cholestatsis: The patient possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side effect. The patient's bilirubin level has stabilized since keppra was stopped.
11. Hx SBP: The patient has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as discussed above.
12. Hx of ESBL UTI: The patient has hx of ESBL UTI and is being treated with meropenem.
13. Ascites/LE Edema: The patient has stable ascites and mild peripheral edema. Diuretics are being held for hyponatremia.
14. HIV: The patient has stable HIV with last CD4 in 600s.
15. Asthma/COPD: The patient has stable asthma/COPD on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right now. Respiratory status compromised because of mental status.
16. Anemia: The patient has slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue to monitor and transfuse for Hct <25.
17. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver disease, did have HIT initially. The patient is being monitored and treated for <10 or if actively bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory status
2. Development of HRS
3. Seizure activity
4. Infection (bacterial or fungal)
5. Further worsening of liver function
6. Development of bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
7. Further deterioration of kidney function
8. Development of electrolyte imbalances
9. Further worsening of mental status
10. Development of cardiac complications due to shock

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these conditions to prevent further complications and improve their overall health."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on trough
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN

   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on trough
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AEL at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 139 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AEL
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent sepsis and seizures. She is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 578 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (from baseline 1.0 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 58 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 1.5 g/dL
* Total bilirubin: 27.1%
* International normalized ratio (INR): 1.8
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 48.1 seconds
* Platelet count: 62,000/μL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 6.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hepatitis C cirrhosis
* Hepato-renal syndrome
* HIV
* Recent sepsis and seizures
* Altered mental status
* Hypotension
* Respiratory distress
* Thrombocytopenia
* Anemia
* Hypothermia

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >75 mmHg
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem)
* Lactulose to treat hepatic encephalopathy
* Albumin to treat hypothermia
* Low-dose vitamin K to treat elevated INR
* Hold diuretics and fluid restriction to manage hyponatremia
* Monitor sodium levels and electrolytes
* Trend LFTs and coags
* Consider diagnostic paracentesis to rule out infection
* Continue to hold AEDs and avoid sedatives that lower the seizure threshold

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Development of hepatorenal syndrome
* Further worsening of liver failure
* Seizure activity
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Infection
* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP this AM.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics but change vancomycin to 750mg
   Q24 and dose by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   this morning.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine 1.7 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely due to poor
   renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na concern for
   development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]

   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.

   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, seizure activity, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing creatinine, and low urine output. She has a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus and is being treated empirically with vancomycin and meropenem. Her liver function tests show worsening bilirubinemia and elevated INR. She has a history of SBP and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. She also has a history of ESBL UTI and is being treated with meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show worsening metabolic acidosis, increasing creatinine, and low urine output, which may be indicative of sepsis. The patient's blood culture is positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus, which may be contributing to her condition.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function tests show worsening bilirubinemia and elevated INR, which may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity may also be related to this condition.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may indicate renal failure. The patient's low urine output and high creatinine level may be indicative of acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be necessary to support her respiratory function. However, the patient's respiratory status may be compromised due to her altered mental status.
5. Infection: The patient's blood culture is positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus, which may indicate a bacterial infection. The patient's history of SBP and ESBL UTI may also be contributing to her condition.
6. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests show worsening bilirubinemia and elevated INR, which may indicate liver failure. The patient's history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepato-renal syndrome may also be contributing to her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including her creatinine level, liver function tests, and blood culture.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with vancomycin and meropenem.
3. Consider performing a diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the patient's ascites.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her mechanical ventilation as necessary.
5. Consider performing a liver biopsy to evaluate the patient's liver function.
6. Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center for further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical with ongoing support in the ICU. The patient is being treated with norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, and despite this, the blood pressure remains in the 100s.

The patient's urine output remains low, and the urine sediment suggests either acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or hypertensive renal syndrome (HRS). The patient's liver function is abnormal, and there is a high risk of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient is not a transplant candidate.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, Aldactone, and penicillins, which may impact future treatment decisions. The patient has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

Physically, the patient is stable, with vital signs within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV and oxygen therapy.

Laboratory results indicate abnormal liver function, kidney function, and electrolyte levels. The patient's white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is considered high-risk, and potential complications include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and abnormal kidney function increase the risk of renal failure, which may require dialysis.
2. C. diff infection: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and there is a high risk of C. diff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's abnormal laboratory results, including elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes, increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abnormal liver function and low platelet count increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhage and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's abnormal blood pressure and heart rate increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and stroke.

Based on this assessment, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and supportive care in the ICU, with ongoing treatment of their underlying conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2200-5-2**]:
   - Continues on levophed, which was increased from 0.05 to 0.07mcg in
   order to maintain MAP >75 O/N. UOP remains stably low at ~25 cc/hr.
   - Renal: No need for RRT, okay to give HCO3 PRN. Urine sediment
   consistent with ATN or HRS.
   - Neuro: 48-hr EEG monitoring w/o sz. Would not recommend AED at this
   time.
   - Liver: Send another C. diff. Recommend central access to monitor
   intravascular status. Not transplant candidate.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She was transferred to the MICU with altered mental status and is intubated due to concern for airway protection. The patient has a complicated medical history, including recent SBP, seizures, and liver failure. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, and is being monitored for sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient appears to be in shock, with a low blood pressure and a high central venous pressure. This could be due to sepsis, poor renal perfusion, or other underlying causes.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. She has a history of respiratory failure and may require further respiratory support.
3. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for further seizures due to her underlying medical conditions and medications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver failure and is at risk for further hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has developed hyponatremia and is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure and is at risk for further renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and is at risk for further infections, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy and is at risk for further bleeding.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and is at risk for further bleeding.
10. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for further bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions. She should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anticonvulsants as needed. She should also be monitored for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's family should be involved in her care and should be educated on her condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   - Add on cortisol to AM labs
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED needed, no seizure PPx at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger if temps stay low
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure (trending down)
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2200-5-2**]:
   - Continues on levophed, which was increased from 0.05 to 0.07mcg in
   order to maintain MAP >75 O/N. UOP remains stably low at ~25 cc/hr.
   - Renal: No need for RRT, okay to give HCO3 PRN. Urine sediment
   consistent with ATN or HRS.
   - Neuro: 48-hr EEG monitoring w/o sz. Would not recommend AED at this
   time.
   - Liver: Send another C. diff. Recommend central access to monitor
   intravascular status. Not transplant candidate.

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are identified:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing intravascular dryness, which may be secondary to sepsis. Close monitoring of volume status is necessary to avoid fluid overload.
2. Respiratory: The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection. The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and they require continued broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring.
3. Altered Mental Status: The etiology of the patient's altered mental status is unclear, with a differential including seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced effects. The patient's EEG is consistent with encephalopathy, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's creatinine is trending upwards, and they have a history of hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary to prevent further worsening.
5. Seizures: The patient has had a seizure, and further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. The patient's EEG is consistent with encephalopathy, and further testing, including MRI, may be necessary.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient had new hyponatremia, which was corrected with hypertonic saline. Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary to prevent further worsening.
7. Hypothermia: The patient may be infected, and empiric treatment with vancomycin and meropenem is being continued.
8. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has underlying hepatitis C cirrhosis, which is worsening, and they are being evaluated for liver transplant.
9. Cholestasis: The patient has cholestasis, which may be secondary to worsening liver failure or keppra side effects.
10. History of SBP: The patient has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and is being treated empirically with vancomycin and meropenem.
11. History of ESBL UTI: The patient has a history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) urinary tract infection, which is stable and being treated with meropenem.
12. Ascites/LE Edema: The patient has ascites and mild peripheral edema, which is stable.
13. HIV: The patient has HIV and is being treated with home medications.
14. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is slowly trending down, and further transfusion may be necessary.
15. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is likely secondary to liver disease, and close monitoring is necessary.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and empiric treatment for sepsis.
2. Monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload.
3. Continue respiratory support with intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Investigate the underlying cause of the patient's altered mental status.
5. Monitor urine output and creatinine levels to prevent further worsening of hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Continue treatment for hyponatremia and close monitoring of sodium levels.
7. Empiric treatment for hypothermia.
8. Continue treatment for hepatitis C cirrhosis and evaluate for liver transplant.
9. Monitor cholestasis and consider further testing.
10. Continue treatment for SBP and ESBL UTI.
11. Monitor ascites and LE edema and consider further treatment if necessary.
12. Continue treatment for HIV and anemia.
13. Monitor thrombocytopenia and consider further treatment if necessary."

   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome now with
   recovered renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12
   - continue levophed to MAP >75 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: prelim read
 epileptiform activity though no
   definite seizure activity (No AED at this time)
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; could
   be contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinin trending up to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0). Most likely
   due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given very low urine Na
   concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - re-check urine lytes and sediment, re-check Creatinine later in day
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH (may not improve status
   overall)
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   - 1 unit pRBCs yesterday with post transfusion HCT 26
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, and HIV. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, creatinine, and INR, indicating liver and kidney dysfunction. She has a history of recent SBP and new seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her compromised immune system and the presence of multiple comorbidities.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her altered mental status, and she requires mechanical ventilation to maintain her airway.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she has a high risk of developing liver failure, which can lead to further complications.
4. Kidney Failure: The patient's kidney function is also compromised, and she has a high risk of developing kidney failure, which can lead to further complications.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recent SBP and new seizures, which may indicate an underlying infection. She is at risk of developing further infections due to her compromised immune system.
6. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which increases her risk of bleeding. She is also at risk of bleeding due to her liver dysfunction and the use of anticoagulant medications.
7. Hypothermia: The patient has a history of hypothermia, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
8. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
10. Fluid Overload: The patient is at risk of developing fluid overload due to her compromised kidney function and the use of diuretic medications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes in her condition.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and bronchodilators as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's liver and kidney function with medications and fluids as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and take appropriate action if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding risk with anticoagulant medications and platelet transfusions as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and take appropriate action if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's seizures with anticonvulsant medications and monitor her for signs of seizure activity.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium levels and take appropriate action if necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and take appropriate action if necessary.
10. Consider consulting with a liver specialist and a nephrologist to further manage the patient's liver and kidney function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, presenting with septic shock, requiring continuous infusion of norepinephrine, and exhibiting signs of hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa, aldactone, penicillins, and bactrim, and has received vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, requiring CPAP/PSV ventilation and oxygen therapy. The patient has a distended abdomen, right and left lower extremity edema, and is jaundiced. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive, with no attention to verbal stimuli, and exhibits non-purposeful movement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to worsen if not adequately managed, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely to progress, leading to worsening electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased oxygen requirements, ventilator dependence, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure may progress, leading to worsening coagulopathy, jaundice, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection: The patient's septic shock may be complicated by secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or increased intracranial pressure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, I summarize the following information:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures.
* She is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway.
* She has a positive BCx with GPC in clusters, likely a contaminant.
* Her creatinine is trending to 1.8, and she has a low urine output.
* She has hyponatremia, which has been resolved, and hypothermia.
* She has a history of SBP and ESBL UTI.
* She is being treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and lactulose.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Hepato-renal syndrome (HRS) with worsening renal function and low urine output.
* Sepsis, possibly secondary to sepsis or infection.
* Respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS or pneumonia.
* Altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, or medication-induced encephalopathy.
* Seizures, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, or underlying organic seizure disorder.
* Hypothermia, possibly infected.
* Cholestasis, possibly due to worsening liver failure or keppra side effect.
* Thrombocytopenia, possibly secondary to liver disease.
* Anemia, possibly due to chronic disease or blood loss.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents to cover possible infections.
* Her creatinine will be closely monitored, and she will receive boluses of fluid if her urine output is low.
* She will continue to receive lactulose to manage her altered mental status.
* Her liver function will be closely monitored, and she will receive albumin and octreotide if necessary.
* She will receive low-dose vitamin K for elevated INR.
* Her seizures will be monitored, and she will receive anticonvulsants if necessary.
* Her respiratory status will be closely monitored, and she will receive oxygen therapy as needed.
* Her hypothermia will be managed with blankets and bear hugger if necessary.
* Her cholestasis will be closely monitored, and she will receive cholestyramine if necessary.
* Her thrombocytopenia will be closely monitored, and she will receive platelet transfusions if necessary.
* Her anemia will be closely monitored, and she will receive blood transfusions if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine trending to 1.8 (from baseline 1.0), improved from
   [**5-3**]. Most likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given
   very low urine Na concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH likely not a viable option
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger if temps stay low
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.  Per hepatology
   likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure (trending down)
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hep C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.5 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear etiology with differential including
   seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia ,
   medication induced (started following ativan administration).   CT head
   with no evidence of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent
   with encephalopathy with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common
   causes.  Cannot exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy
   and uremia.  CXR on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.  More interactive
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - f/u final neuro recs
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine trending to 1.8 (from baseline 1.0), improved from
   [**5-3**]. Most likely due to poor renal perfusion, HRS vs. prerenal. Given
   very low urine Na concern for development of HRS.  UOP low overnight.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   bolus if < 30 cc/hr
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   - F/U renal, liver recs re: treatment for HRS
   - Discuss with family goals of care, CVVH likely not a viable option
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neuro recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140 this morning.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger if temps stay low
   ..
   # Hep C Cirrhosis: has underlying hep C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and
   woresning bilirubinemia.  Possibly has cholestasis from the keppra that
   was started about a week ago.  Has intermittent encephalopathy per the
   floor team but has been under good control recently.  Per hepatology
   likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs, is being evaluated for transplant but unlikely
   candidate given co-morbidities
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR yesterday; no improvement
   - Check bladder pressure (trending down)
   .
   # Cholestatsis: possibly due to worsening liver failure vs. keppra side
   effect.  Keppra has been stopped and the rising bili has stabilized
   - continue to trend
   - hold AED
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   - consider diagnostic paracentesis if sufficient ascites
 will
   re-check with bedside US today
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.
   - send UA and cultures
   .
   # Ascites/LE Edema: is stable per floor team, does have tense belly and
   mild peripheral edema.  Diuretics being held for hyponatremia.
   - continue to hold diuretics for now
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Asthma/COPD: stable on 3L nasal canula, no wheezes on exam right
   now.  Respiratory status compromised because of mentatl status.
   - nebs PRN
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down now with guaiac + stool; will continue
   to monitor and transfuse for hct <25.
   -  recheck HCT this AM
   -  guaiac + stool
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for inability to protect airway. The patient has a picture consistent with ARDS, and bronchoscopy revealed mucous plugging and collapse.
* Cardiovascular: The patient appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports, although given third spacing and albumin administration, fluid administration is unlikely to remain intravascular. The patient requires increasing doses of levophed to maintain MAP > 75.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, unclear etiology, with differential including seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, and medication-induced. The patient has a 24-hour EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges consistent with non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
* Renal: The patient has worsening renal function, with creatinine trending to 1.8 (from baseline 1.0), and is likely to develop HRS. The patient's urine output is low, and fluid bolus is being given if <30 cc/hr.
* Hepatic: The patient has underlying Hepatitis C cirrhosis with INR 1.8 and worsening bilirubinemia. The patient is being evaluated for liver transplant but is unlikely a candidate due to co-morbidities.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Development of HRS due to worsening renal function and low urine output
* Further deterioration of liver function leading to worsening coagulopathy and encephalopathy
* Seizure activity or status epilepticus due to ongoing encephalopathy
* Infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis, due to immunocompromised state
* Fluid overload or hyponatremia due to continued diuretic use
* Respiratory failure due to ARDS or underlying lung disease
* Cardiovascular instability due to ongoing shock and requirement for increasing doses of levophed
* Neurological deterioration due to ongoing encephalopathy or seizure activity

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, hepatologists, and infectious disease specialists, are necessary to optimize her care and prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 45 minutes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has been receiving treatment with vanc and meropenem, but the septic shock persists, with increasing pressor requirements.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 137 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 115/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* White blood cell count: 10.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 44 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 39 mg/dL
* Sodium: 134 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L
* Glucose: 174 mg/dL

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

* Septic shock
* Hypothermia
* Hyponatremia
* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Respiratory failure
* Liver failure
* Altered mental status

The patient's condition is deteriorating, and the prognosis is worsening. The patient's family should be involved in discussions about the patient's goals of care, as the patient's condition is likely to worsen.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's septic shock
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Progression of acute kidney injury to acute kidney failure
* Development of liver failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances

In terms of management, the patient should continue to receive treatment with vanc and meropenem, and the pressor requirements should be closely monitored. The patient's electrolyte imbalances should be closely monitored and treated as necessary. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for mechanical ventilation if necessary. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for liver transplantation if necessary. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for treatment of delirium if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall individual weighing 100 kg, admitted to the ICU with unknown underlying medical conditions. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. They are dependent on levophed infusion to maintain a MAP of >65, and their urine output is low (10-20cc/hr).

The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm with a rate of 87 bpm. They have a history of PSVT, which broke spontaneously and was treated with adenosine. The patient is also icteric and has low urine output.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 96% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Their ABG results show a pH of 7.28, PCO2 of 32 mmHg, PO2 of 111 mmHg, and HCO3 of 13 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), as well as elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Their coagulation studies show a prolonged PT and PTT, and their electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is notable for diffuse pitting edema, jaundice, and inspiratory rhonchi. They have a regular rhythm with a rate of 87 bpm and a blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated bilirubin levels may indicate liver dysfunction, which could lead to respiratory failure if not addressed.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of PSVT and the use of levophed infusion may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Septic shock: The patient's low urine output and elevated liver enzymes may indicate septic shock, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's use of levophed infusion and the presence of pitting edema may increase the risk of pulmonary edema.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of levophed infusion and the presence of jaundice may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.

In conclusion, the patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address the patient's underlying medical conditions and improve their clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2200-5-4**] 11:15 AM
   - regular narrow complex tachycardia rate in 140s, likely PSVT, broke
   spontaneously. Adenosine at bed side. Possibly due to increased
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75. MAP goal reduced to >65
   verified w/ renal.
   - Remains dependent on levophed gtt, attempt to reduce dose but MAP <65
   so subsequently levophed gtt increased to 0.15mcg. Continues to be
   icteric with low urine output (10-20cc/hr).  Pt continues to be
   intubated on PS with a FiO2 40% 5/10. Pt with a RR of 21-30, PEAK of
   16, SpO2 94-96 and TV in the 600
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] attempted to discuss goals of care with family, but unable

Summary:

The patient remains critically ill in the ICU with ongoing dependence on vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient's condition is complicated by ongoing tachycardia, likely due to increased levophed requirement. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. Despite efforts to reduce levophed dose, the patient's MAP remains below the target range. The patient continues to have low urine output (10-20 cc/hr) and is icteric.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing dependence on vasopressors to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg suggests a high risk of hypotension if the vasopressor dose is reduced or if there is a sudden drop in blood pressure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of PSVT and ongoing tachycardia suggest a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if the levophed dose is increased or if there are changes in the patient's electrolyte levels.
3. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output (10-20 cc/hr) and icteric appearance suggest a high risk of renal failure, particularly if the patient's vasopressor dependence is not addressed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing dependence on mechanical ventilation and FiO2 of 40% suggests a high risk of respiratory failure, particularly if there are changes in the patient's lung compliance or if the patient develops a respiratory infection.
5. Infection: The patient's icteric appearance and low urine output suggest a high risk of infection, particularly if the patient's gut is not properly cared for.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing use of anticoagulation therapy and history of stress ulcer prophylaxis suggest a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if the patient's vasopressor dependence is not addressed.
7. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's icteric appearance and elevated liver enzymes suggest a high risk of hepatic dysfunction, particularly if the patient's liver function is not properly monitored.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2200-5-4**] 11:15 AM
   - regular narrow complex tachycardia rate in 140s, likely PSVT, broke
   spontaneously. Adenosine at bed side. Possibly due to increased
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75. MAP goal reduced to >65
   verified w/ renal.
   - Remains dependent on levophed gtt, attempt to reduce dose but MAP <65
   so subsequently levophed gtt increased to 0.15mcg. Continues with low
   urine output (10-20cc/hr).
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] attempted to discuss goals of care with family, but unable
   to get in touch.
   - No overnight events.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is currently intubated and being treated in the MICU for shock, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and sepsis. Her vital signs are stable, with a MAP goal of >65 and a CVP of 8-12. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, levophed, and lactulose. Her laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine of 2.4 and low urine output. She also has hyponatremia, which has been resolved with hypertonic saline.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's MAP goal is >65, and she is receiving levophed to maintain this level. However, her CVP is 8-12, which may indicate that she is not responding to fluid resuscitation. This could lead to further fluid overload and worsening of her renal function.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. However, her respiratory status is still unstable, with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. This could lead to further respiratory failure and the need for more invasive respiratory support.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including seizure activity, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection. This could lead to further decline in her mental status and the need for more aggressive treatment.
4. Sepsis: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her sepsis is not yet fully controlled. This could lead to further decline in her vital signs and the need for more aggressive treatment.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is 2.4, and her urine output is low. This could lead to further decline in her renal function and the need for renal replacement therapy.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has been resolved with hypertonic saline, but she is still at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
7. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function tests are worsening, and she is at risk for further decline in her mental status and the need for more aggressive treatment.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of SBP and is at risk for further infection. This could lead to further decline in her vital signs and the need for more aggressive treatment.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent further decline."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger for low temperature
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis:  She continues to be anicteric with a
   worsening INR and liver function tests and a MELD today of 44.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <5
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Appears more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   to maintain MAP > 75 but this AM narrow complex tachycardia with rate
   to 140s possibly due to increased levophed.
   . Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - though would monitor volume status closely to avoid fluid overload
   - CVP 8-12 (though no current mechanism to monitor)
   - continue levophed to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome;
   consider bolus if < 20 cc/hr
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   - monitor bladder pressure
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI when stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger for low temperature
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis:  She continues to be anicteric with a
   worsening INR and liver function tests and a MELD today of 44.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - Low dose vitamin K for elevated INR
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <5
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and a recent history of SBP and seizures. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the MICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic status: The patient is in shock, with a MAP goal of >65 mmHg. She is dependent on levophed to maintain blood pressure, and her urine output is low (10-25 cc/hr).
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is 96%, and her peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O.
* Neurological status: The patient has altered mental status, with a possible diagnosis of non-convulsive status epileptiform discharges. She is at risk for seizures and has a history of seizure disorder.
* Hepatic status: The patient has worsening liver function tests and a MELD score of 44, indicating severe liver disease. She is not a candidate for liver transplantation at this time.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.8-2.4 mg/dL and low urine output. She is at risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
* Infectious status: The patient has a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Development of HRS, which can worsen the patient's renal function and increase the risk of mortality.
* Seizures, which can worsen the patient's neurological status and increase the risk of respiratory compromise.
* Infection, which can worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of mortality.
* Liver failure, which can worsen the patient's hepatic status and increase the risk of mortality.
* Respiratory failure, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of mortality.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing her hemodynamic, respiratory, and neurological status, as well as preventing and treating potential complications. This may involve adjusting her medications, including her pressor agents and antibiotics, as well as providing supportive care, such as fluid management and nutrition. The patient's family should be educated on her condition and treatment plan, and a family meeting should be held to discuss her goals of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Contine on PSV.
   Septic shock:  No definite source.  On broad spectrum antibiotics
   (vanco and [**Last Name (un) **]) empirically.
   Acute renal failure: hepatorenal syndrome versus ATN.  Not a great
   candidate for RRT as overall prognosis is very poor because she is not
   transplant
   candidate.
   Cirrhosis:   MELD score of 44.  Overall poor prognosis.  Poor MS c/w
   encephalopathy
   Will try to gather family for meeting given overall poor prognosis and
   lack of options for further treatment.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD), HIV, and a history of encephalopathy, septic shock, and renal failure. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with respiratory failure and septic shock. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* White Blood Cell Count: 15.0 K/uL
* Platelet Count: 39
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 165 mg/dL
* Serum Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
* Serum Sodium: 118 mEq/L
* Serum Chloride: 143 mEq/L
* Albumin: 1.4 g/dL
* Lactic Acid: 2.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 589 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 7.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for septic shock, and her respiratory status is being managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) syndrome may lead to further organ failure, such as cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support her respiratory function.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL suggests AKI, which may worsen her overall prognosis.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's ESLD and AKI may lead to hepatorenal syndrome, which is a poor prognostic indicator.
5. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and catheters may increase her risk of developing infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) or catheter-related urinary tract infections (UTIs).
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Encephalopathy: The patient's ESLD and septic shock may worsen her encephalopathy, leading to further neurological dysfunction or even death.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's septic shock and cardiovascular instability may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.

Given the patient's critical condition and poor prognosis, it is essential to prioritize her care and manage her complications aggressively to improve her chances of survival."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt received cefepime accidental dose x 1 (another patient's
   medication). Has PCN allergy (hives) but no known anaphylaxis. No
   immediate rxn. No meds given at this time.
   - Discussed poor prognosis with son. Renal also discussed futility of
   RRT. Change in code status to DNR (ok to continue intubation, ok to
   continue pressors). Son contacting family for potential family meeting
   on Tuesday.
   - Transfused 1 unit pRBC; post-transfusion Hct - 24 (from 22)
   - Coags markedly worse with PM labs; son was called to notify him that
   patient's labs are becoming progressively unstable and that family
   meeting should not be detained until Friday as complications may arise
   before then. He will try to arrange for meeting tomorrow afternoon. Had
   Qs about meaning of ""CMO"" when this issue was raised; still seems very
   hesitant to change plan of care.
   - Few hundred cc's of guaiac-positive maroon fluid removed from stomach

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

* The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures, who is being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
* The patient's liver function is worsening, with a MELD score of 51, and is likely not a candidate for transplant at this time.
* The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and recent suctioning has revealed likely gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further treatment with FFP/DDAVP.
* The patient is in shock, with a dry appearance and laboratory reports suggesting intravascular dehydration, despite fluid administration. The patient's MAP is low, and pressor requirements have increased overnight.
* The patient is intubated due to altered mental status and concern for airway protection, with a picture consistent with ARDS.
* The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with persistent AMS and concern for airway protection.
* The patient's altered mental status is likely due to seizure/post-ictal, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia, or medication-induced causes, with a 24-hour EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges.
* The patient has a history of seizures, with unclear etiology, and is currently on vancomycin and meropenem for suspected infection.
* The patient's anemia is slowly trending down, with guaiac-positive stool, and may require transfusion for active bleeding or HCT <24.
* The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, likely secondary to liver disease, and may require transfusion for <10 or active bleeding.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further worsening of liver function, leading to increased risk of bleeding and death
* Development of hepatorenal syndrome, which may require further treatment with albumin, octreotide, and midodrine
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and altered mental status
* Further bleeding, which may require transfusion and further treatment with FFP/DDAVP
* Development of ARDS, which may require further treatment with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy
* Continued worsening of renal function, leading to increased risk of acute kidney injury and death
* Seizure activity, which may require further treatment with anticonvulsants and monitoring
* Hypothermia, which may require further treatment with vancomycin and bear hugger prn

The patient's code status is DNR, with permission to continue intubation and pressors as needed. The patient's family has been notified of the poor prognosis and is being counseled on the need for a family meeting to discuss goals of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger prn for low temperature
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT (check PM)
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <24
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 y/o F with hx of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome with
   worsening renal function, HIV, hx of recent SBP and new seizures who is
   being transferred to the MICU with altered mental status.
   .
   # Hepatitis C Cirrhosis with hepatic failure:  She continues to be
   grossly icteric with a worsening INR and liver function tests and a
   MELD today of 51. Vitamin K for elevated INR has not been helpful in
   lowering INR.  With new likely GIB noted on suctioning today, will
   likely need FFP/DDAVP depending on goals of  care.
   Per hepatology likely not candidate for transplant at this time.
   - continue to trend LFTs/coags
   - f/u liver recs
   - continue lactulose
   - consider FFP/DDAVP for UGIB if goals of care remain the same.  Repeat
   HCT at 0900 this morning.
   .
   # Shock
 appears intravascularly dry on exam and on laboratory reports
   although given third spacing and with albumin of 1.4 fluid
   administration unlikely to remain intravascular.  Previously more
   interactive with higher MAP.   Increased pressor requirement overnight
   with addition of an additional pressor.
   - Possibly secondary to sepsis.
   - Monitor volume status closely to avoid further fluid overload
 avoid
   IVF as minimal UOP
   - continue levophed/vasopressin to MAP >65 PRN (for decreasing UOP)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics and dose vancomycin by trough
   .
   #Respiratory: Intubated due to altered mental status and concern for
   inability to protect airway.  Picture consistent with [**Doctor Last Name 76**], possibly
   meets criteria for ARDS.  Bronchoscopy with evidence of mucous
   plugging, collapse
   - Would defer extubation given persistent AMS and concern for airway
   protection
   - Continue antibiotics with vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] for ? PNA as above
   - Attempted AC low tidal volume (6cc/kg) but patient was pulling large
   tidal volumes (800cc) and auto-peeping to 25.  Could not tolerate AC
   and switched to PSV.
   # Goals of Care: patient
s hepatic failure continues to worsen as
   evidenced by worsening t. bili and INR.  Extremely unlikely that
   patient will recover from this illness.
   - Arrange family meeting as expeditiously as possible to address goals
   of care.
   .
   # Altered mental status:  The differential includes seizure/post-ictal,
   hepatic encephalopathy, infection, hyponatremia , medication induced
   (started following ativan administration).   CT head with no evidence
   of acute process or cerebral edema. EEG consistent with encephalopathy
   with toxic/metabolic or infection being most common causes.  Cannot
   exclude seizure activity due to hepatic encephalopathy and uremia.  CXR
   on [**4-28**] with possible RLL opacity.
   - 24 hour EEG completed: generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted.
   - F/U infectious work-up (blood cx, urine cx, consider diagnostic
   paracentesis if tappable pocket)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now (vancomycin/meropenem)
   - hyponatremia resolved, continue to monitor
   - continue lactulose
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - Avoid sedatives (ativan) and medications that lower the seizure
   threshold .
   # Positive BCx. GPC in clusters from [**4-27**] -> coag negative staph; likely
   contaminant as only 1/4 bottles positive.
   - Treat through for now given only
 bottle positive (may still require
   PICC changed out). Likely contaminant
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - dose vancomycin based on level
   .
   # ARF: Creatinine ranging from 1.8  to 2.4 (from baseline 1.0) and
   continues to have low urine output (10-25cc/hr). The differential
   includes poor renal perfusion, possibly ATN vs. HRS. Given very low
   urine Na concern for development of HRS.  Renal evaluation over the
   weekend noted that renal replacement therapy will not be an option.
   Bladder pressures 24 today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - follow urine output closely given history of hepatorenal syndrome
   - F/U renal and liver recs regarding treatment for HRS
   .
   # SVT: Patient had episode of regular narrow complex tachycardia on
   [**2200-5-3**] likely PSVT, broke spontaneously.  Possibly due to increasing
   levophed requirement to maintain MAP >75.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - lower MAP requirement to >65 (from >75)
   - adenosine at bedside
   .
   # Seizures: unclear why patient has seizure disorder, could be
   secondary to swelling for liver failure, could be underlying organic
   seizure disorder than is now manifesting itself bc of cipro and the
   wearing off of keppra.
   - 24 hour  EEG showing generalized epileptiform discharges c/w
   non-convulsive status, but no definitive seizure activity noted
   - MRI if stable
   - neurology recommending no AED at this time
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Hypothermia: possibly infected. Currently maintaining body temp, but
   low.
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **] empirically.
   - Bear hugger prn for low temperature
   .
   # Hyponatremia: had new hyponatremia, thought to be secondary to
   diuretic use and possible SIADH. FeNa < 1%. Concern for possible
   hepatorenal in setting of rising INR, creatinine with current.
   Corrected from 128 to 136 over past 36 hours with hypertonic saline.
   Resolved at 140.
   - continue to hold diuretics
   - fluid restriction for 1000 ml daily
   - monitor sodium level carefully throughout the day
   - F/U liver recs re: use of albumin, octreotide, midodrine
   - Trend electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hx SBP: has hx of SBP and was started on cipro ppx; in setting of
   altered mental status, should worry about new infection, although based
   on clinical setting, has a lower likelihood that seizure disorder as
   discussed above.
   -  re-check bedside US today and consider diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis if sufficient ascites
   - Continue vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Hx of ESBL UTI: stable, s/p treatment with meropenem.  Multiple UA
   and cultures no growth to date.
   .
   # HIV: stable, last CD4 in 600s.
   - continue home meds (renally dosed)
   .
   # Anemia: slowly trending down with  guaiac + stool
   -  continue to monitor HCT (check PM)
   - consider transfusion for active bleed or HCT <24
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: stable, likely secondary to liver disease, did have
   HIT initially.  Continue to trend, tx for <10 or if actively bleeding.
   Consider DDAVP if actively bleeding.
   .
   # FEN: albumin for SBP / replete lytes prn / continue TF

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, hepato-renal syndrome, HIV, and recent SBP and seizures. She is intubated and in the ICU with worsening renal function, liver failure, and altered mental status. The patient has a poor prognosis and is unlikely to recover from her illness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is worsening, and she is at risk for further hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to increased confusion, seizures, and eventually death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but her respiratory status is worsening, and she may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is rising, and she is at risk for further kidney damage or failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and her altered mental status puts her at risk for further seizures, which could lead to respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, or other complications.
5. Infection: The patient has a positive BCx and GPC in clusters, which could indicate a bacterial infection. She is also at risk for further infections, such as pneumonia, UTI, or sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen her condition.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, and she is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances, which could lead to seizures, coma, or death.
8. Hypothermia: The patient's body temperature is low, and she is at risk for further hypothermia, which could lead to cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, or death.
9. ARF: The patient's creatinine is rising, and she is at risk for acute kidney injury, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function, renal function, and electrolyte levels closely.
2. Consider further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation, to improve the patient's respiratory status.
3. Continue antibiotics and antivirals as prescribed to treat any potential infections.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's sodium level and consider further treatment if necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider further interventions, such as diuretics or albumin, to improve the patient's renal function and prevent further fluid overload.
7. Consider further interventions, such as vasopressors or inotropes, to improve the patient's cardiac function and blood pressure.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further interventions, such as sedation or neuromuscular blockade, to improve her comfort and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), HIV, and septic shock. She has been experiencing worsening septic shock and has been on increasing doses of pressors. Her son made her DNR (do not resuscitate) yesterday. The patient's family is being called for a meeting today to readdress her goals of care, as her chances of recovery are now minimal.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
* Heart rate: 102 bpm
* Blood pressure: 82/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: sinus rhythm

The patient has a distended abdomen and bilateral lower extremity edema. She is jaundiced and has warm skin. Her neurologic examination is abnormal, with no attentive response, no following of simple commands, and no movement or tone assessment.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 15.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 32 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 122 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 1.4 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 4.1 mmol/L
* Liver function tests: elevated

The patient has multi-organ system failure, including renal failure, liver failure, and hepatic encephalopathy. She has evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and will receive PRBCs, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to further organ dysfunction, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's upper gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to further worsening of her mental status, potentially resulting in coma or death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection: The patient's septic shock may lead to further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's septic shock may lead to cardiac arrest, potentially resulting in death.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to coagulopathy, potentially resulting in bleeding complications.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to potentially life-threatening complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 45-year-old woman with ESLD, HIV, and septic shock, is critically ill and experiencing multi-organ system failure. She has been on increasing doses of pressors, and her condition has worsened over the past 24 hours. She has developed respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and is experiencing septic shock. Her liver function is impaired, leading to hepatic encephalopathy. She has also developed renal failure and is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of electrolyte and fluid disorders, including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of sepsis, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. She has also developed right and left lower extremity edema.

The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, with decreased level of consciousness, no response to verbal commands, and no movement.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can progress, leading to further organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy can worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding, coma, and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding can worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, bleeding, and death.
6. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorders can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing secondary infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infections.
8. Organ failure: The patient's multi-organ system failure can progress, leading to cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal failure.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to limit care and focus on comfort measures, pending visits from other family members. The patient will receive no further transfusions, and her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."
