   52 y/o lady with hyptension presented to the Emergency Department with
   swollen tongue and funny feeling in her tongue and was intubated for
   airway protection.
   .
   # Angioedema:  Presentation consistent with anioedema and/or allergic
   reactioin.  Normal eos and only lip,cheeks,tongue swelling argues for
   angioedema.  Anesthesiologist who intubated her did not notice any
   airway swelling, all upper airway.  Has been on lisinopril since
   [**2127-1-23**].  History of using NSAIDS prn. No known new
   exposures.  SVC syndrome will be lower in the differential given no
   upper extremity swelling.  However she is on OCP.  No signs or symptoms
   of infection.
   -Swelling in lips, face, tongue greatly decreased today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to angioedema, a severe allergic reaction characterized by swelling of the lips, face, and tongue. The patient was intubated for airway protection and has been receiving sedation and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for swollen lips, asymmetrical swelling of the cheeks, and a lack of upper airway swelling. The patient's neurologic examination is limited due to sedation, and the patient's pupils are pinpoint.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.3 g/dL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 199 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are 24 mEq/L and 0.6 mg/dL, respectively.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, asthma, and chronic uterine fibroids. The patient has a history of using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and lisinopril, and the patient is currently taking OCP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's angioedema and airway edema may lead to respiratory failure, and the patient's mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support respiratory function.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection, and the patient's respiratory support may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's angioedema may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, and the patient's sedation may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's sedation and respiratory support may lead to neurologic complications such as seizures and cerebral edema.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and angioedema may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient's underlying medical conditions and the patient's prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema and presented to the Emergency Department with swollen tongue and a ""funny feeling"" in her tongue. She has a history of hypertension and is on lisinopril. The patient's swelling has decreased significantly overnight, and she is currently on steroids, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.3 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. Her chest X-ray shows hilar lymphadenopathy, which is an incidental finding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's airway is still at risk due to the presence of angioedema, and there is a risk of aspiration or airway compromise if the patient's swelling worsens or if the intubation tube becomes dislodged.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is currently being managed, but there is a risk of rebound hypertension if the patient is not carefully monitored and treated.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the use of steroids, which increases the risk of infection.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and history of hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of steroids and H2 blockers may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastritis or esophagitis.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's use of sedatives and anxiolytics may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or delirium.
7. Skin complications: The patient's use of steroids may increase the risk of skin complications, such as skin thinning or bruising.

Plan:

1. Continue invasive ventilation and monitor the patient's airway closely.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's chest X-ray and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's skin status and adjust treatment as necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of invasive ventilation due to angioedema. The patient has a history of allergies, including anaphylaxis to erythromycin, penicillins, codeine, and Bactrim, as well as a history of asthma and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 199 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose of 96 mg/dL. The patient's differential count shows a neutrophil count of 60.0%, lymphocyte count of 32.3%, monocyte count of 3.8%, and eosinophil count of 3.1%.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the intubation, but the patient is responding to verbal stimuli and has normal skin and neurologic examination findings.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: Hypotension, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Neurological complications: Seizures, stroke, and cerebral edema.
4. Infection complications: Sepsis, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding, ileus, and pancreatitis.
6. Hematological complications: Bleeding, coagulopathy, and anemia.
7. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's airway is at risk due to the inability to protect it, which may lead to aspiration and altered gag reflex. The patient's history of asthma and hypertension may also increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular complications.

Based on the provided information, it is recommended to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to detect any potential complications early."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with swollen tongue and a funny feeling in her tongue, leading to intubation for airway protection due to suspected angioedema or allergic reaction. She has a history of hypertension, asthma, and taking lisinopril. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a diagnosis of angioedema and no signs or symptoms of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient's airway is compromised due to angioedema, making her at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and altered airway clearance and cough.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving steroids and has a history of asthma, which may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, but is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged hospitalization.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may worsen during her hospital stay due to various medications and underlying conditions.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of chronic uterine fibroids, which may contribute to her anemia.
7. Allergic reactions: The patient has multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to penicillins, codeine, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, which may increase the risk of allergic reactions to future medications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving medications that may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
9. Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may increase the risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or brain damage."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with swollen tongue and airway protection due to angioedema. She has a history of hypertension, asthma, and multiple allergies.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 40% and is being monitored for fluid balance and hemodynamic status.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and glucose levels. Her allergy tests are pending, and she is receiving treatment for angioedema with steroids, antihistamines, and antacids.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, asthma, and multiple allergies, which may be contributing factors to her current condition. She has a history of chronic uterine fibroids, which may be causing anemia.

The patient's current medications include amlodipine for hypertension, nebs for asthma, and prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis. She is also receiving treatment for angioedema with steroids, antihistamines, and antacids.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's angioedema may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypertension and possible cardiac history may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Anaphylaxis: The patient's multiple allergies may increase the risk of anaphylaxis if not properly managed.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to steroid therapy may increase the risk of infection.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of thrombosis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued treatment for angioedema with steroids, antihistamines, and antacids.
2. Monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and hemodynamic status.
3. Laboratory tests to monitor for anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and other potential complications.
4. Medication adjustments as needed to manage hypertension, asthma, and other medical conditions.
5. Close monitoring for potential complications and prompt intervention if necessary."

   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 52 yo F presents with angioedema, intubated
   for airway protection. Received steroids, H2B, benadryl, nebs. Ace-I
   held. Significant improvement in tongue and mucosal (lip) swelling.
   Extubated successfully yesterday.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.1 BP 146/80 HR 68 RR 12 with sat 99-100% on RA
   (40%) .
   Alert awake following commands, no evidence of tongue, lip edema, face
   appears assymmetric--+ mild edema at R cheek, no stridor, CTA without
   wheeze, RR, obese, benign abd
   Labs
no new, allergy labs pending
   CXR with ET in position LAD in hilum, no focal pna
   Issues include:
     * angioedema
     * respiratory failure (airway control) --extubated
     * asthma
     * htn
     * hilar LAD on cxr
   Angioedema largely resolved.  Still with mild R facial swelling.  Will
   continue benadryl, H2B.  Decrease steroids to prednisone 40 and taper
   over next few days. Remains on ISS while on steroids though needs
   should improved with decreased steroid dose.  Allergy input
   appreciated.  Allergy labs pending and will need allergy outpt f/u.  BP
   mildly elevated as holding ace-1.  Will start low dose calcium channel
   blocker.
   Stable for floor transfer.
   Will need outpt ct chest for further eval of hilar lad evident on cxr.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with swollen tongue and a funny feeling in her tongue, leading to intubation for airway protection. She was diagnosed with angioedema, likely caused by lisinopril and NSAIDs. She has multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to penicillins, codeine, and Bactrim. She also has hypertension, asthma, and anemia secondary to chronic uterine fibroids.

The patient's condition has improved significantly since yesterday, with mild right facial swelling being the only remaining symptom of angioedema. She was extubated successfully and is currently receiving steroids, H2 blockers, and antihistamines. Her allergy labs are pending, and she will need outpatient follow-up.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's airway control is still a concern, and she may need to be reintubated if her respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and her lung fields are currently clear. However, she may still experience asthma exacerbations in the future.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently mildly elevated, and she is at risk of developing hypertension-related complications if not properly managed.
4. Hilar lymphadenopathy: The patient has an incidental finding of hilar lymphadenopathy on her CXR, which may require further evaluation and follow-up.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to chronic uterine fibroids, and she may need to be monitored for any worsening of her anemia.
6. Allergic reactions: The patient has multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis, and may be at risk of experiencing allergic reactions to certain medications or substances.
7. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema is currently under control, but she may still experience recurrences in the future.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and airway control.
2. Manage the patient's hypertension with a low-dose calcium channel blocker.
3. Follow up with the patient's allergy specialist to determine the best course of action for her allergies.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation if necessary.
5. Consider ordering a chest CT scan to further evaluate the patient's hilar lymphadenopathy.
6. Educate the patient on the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and angioedema, and provide her with a plan for emergency treatment.
7. Consider referring the patient to a specialist for further evaluation and management of her asthma and hypertension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 24-hour-old ICU admission, has been extubated and is receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 40% FiO2. They are on CPAP mode with a set rate of 14 and a spontaneous rate of 21. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/80 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is being weaned, with a plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O and a compliance of 50 cmH2O/mL. The patient's allergy history includes anaphylaxis to erythromycin, penicillins, codeine, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. They have a history of asthma and hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 199 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile shows an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 26.2 seconds, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 13.5 seconds.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway due to angioedema puts them at risk for aspiration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's weaning from mechanical ventilation may be complicated by respiratory failure, particularly if their underlying lung disease is not adequately managed.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac disease may increase their risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines and tubes increase their risk for infection.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of asthma and potential use of corticosteroids may increase their risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Neurologic Complications: The patient's underlying neurologic condition and potential use of sedatives may increase their risk for neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and potential use of prophylactic anticoagulation may increase their risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness and potential use of corticosteroids may increase their risk for stress ulcer bleeding.
9. VAP: The patient's presence in the ICU and use of invasive lines and tubes may increase their risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 52-year-old female, was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema and an allergic reaction. She has a history of hypertension, asthma, and chronic uterine fibroids. The patient's allergy history includes anaphylaxis to penicillins, codeine, and bactrim, as well as a rash to erythromycin base and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. She was extubated yesterday and has been on steroids, pepcid, and benadryl for allergy management.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 68 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 146/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.0-11.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 199-204 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 96-134 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Swelling in the lips, face, and tongue, which has decreased significantly
* No signs of infection
* Normal lung fields

Potential medical complications:

* Aspiration due to inability to protect the airway
* Airway obstruction due to residual swelling
* Hypertension exacerbation due to steroid use
* Anemia exacerbation due to chronic uterine fibroids
* Infection due to prolonged intubation
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to immobility
* Stress ulcer due to steroid use
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation

Plan:

* Continue allergy management with steroids, pepcid, and benadryl
* Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary
* Wean sedation and switch to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as tolerated
* Monitor for signs of hypertension exacerbation and adjust antihypertensive therapy as necessary
* Monitor for signs of anemia exacerbation and adjust iron therapy as necessary
* Continue prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
* Consider VAP prophylaxis with heparin and antibiotics
* Monitor for signs of VTE and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary
* Plan for outpatient follow-up with a pulmonologist and a dermatologist for further evaluation and management of angioedema and hypertension."
