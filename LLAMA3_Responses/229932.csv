   presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3762**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8904**] office yesterday ([**2183-8-11**]) to
   establish primary care and was noted to have an elevated BP 180/120 and
   tachycardia 120. Patient was sent to [**Location (un) 3**] [**Hospital1 5**] ER and troponins
   were trended - 0.014, 0.02, 0.017. ECHO demonstrated EF 15-20% and
   consequently patient was transfered to [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital1 5**] for cath. Prior to
   transfer patient received ASA 325 mg and Heparin. Cath demonstrated
   clean coronaries, however did show elevated filling pressures,
   pulmonary hypertension and low CO. Patient was hypertensive in cath lab
   and started on Nitroglycerin and Nitropresside. Patient was admitted to
   CCU for further management of hypertensive urgency and heart failure.
   .
   Patient reports shortness of breath of one year duration, however
   worsened in the past month. Patient becomes SOB walking several yards,
   prior he was able to walk a 18-hole golf course. 1 month ago patient
   describes malaise, weakness, fatigue, increased urination and diarrhea

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male who presented to his primary care physician with a chief complaint of hypertension and tachycardia. He had no prior medical history and had not followed up with his primary care physician. He was sent to the emergency department where he was found to have elevated troponins and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 15-20%. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management of hypertensive urgency and heart failure.

The patient reports shortness of breath of one year duration, which worsened in the past month. He also reports malaise, weakness, fatigue, increased urination, and diarrhea over the past week. He denies prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, or red stools.

The patient has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, but is unaware of his history. He has a family history of myocardial infarction and diabetes.

Physical examination reveals an overweight gentleman in no acute distress. His blood pressure is 123/70 mmHg, pulse is 98 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Laboratory results show elevated troponins, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. His electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with a normal axis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with hypertensive cardiomyopathy and subacute systolic heart failure. The plan is to attempt blood pressure control and start long-term medications to improve ejection fraction. The patient will be started on lisinopril, nifedipine, and aspirin. He will also be weaned off nitropresside and nitroglycerin and converted to oral medications. The patient will need to be on a low-salt diet and will require ongoing monitoring of his blood pressure and cardiac function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's ejection fraction is only 15%, which increases his risk of cardiac failure.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, which increases his risk of a hypertensive crisis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which increases his risk of renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which increases his risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient is taking anticoagulant therapy, which increases his risk of bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and cardiac function closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as necessary to control his blood pressure and improve his cardiac function.
3. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.
4. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider sending a culture if it spikes.
5. Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent infection."

   Chief Complaint: transfer from [**Location (un) 3**] for cath
   24 Hour Events:
   50 year old male with no medical care in over 20 years. Patient
   presented to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3762**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8904**] office yesterday ([**2183-8-11**]) to
   establish primary care and was noted to have an elevated BP 180/120 and
   tachycardia 120. Patient was sent to [**Location (un) 3**] [**Hospital1 5**] ER and troponins
   were trended - 0.014, 0.02, 0.017. ECHO demonstrated EF 15-20% and
   consequently patient was transfered to [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital1 5**] for cath. Prior to
   transfer patient received ASA 325 mg and Heparin. Cath demonstrated
   clean coronaries, however did show elevated filling pressures,
   pulmonary hypertension and low CO. Patient was hypertensive in cath lab
   and started on Nitroglycerin and Nitropresside. Patient was admitted to
   CCU for further management of hypertensive urgency and heart failure.
   .
   Patient reports shortness of breath of one year duration, however
   worsened in the past month. Patient becomes SOB walking several yards,
   prior he was able to walk a 18-hole golf course. 1 month ago patient
   describes malaise, weakness, fatigue, increased urination and diarrhea
   for 1 week duration. Patient states it improved when he decreased his
   fluid intake (cola). During this peroid he had an epidose of dizziness
   (no LOC, syncope) which improved with rest.  Patient denies PND or
   lower extremity edema. Denies chest pain, but does complain of
   intermittent epigastric discomfort and palpitations. Patient unaware of
   an history of HTN or high cholesterol.
   .
   On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
   venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male who was transferred to the CCU from the ER with a diagnosis of hypertensive urgency and systolic heart failure. He has a history of no medical care in over 20 years and presented with elevated blood pressure and tachycardia. The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries, but showed elevated filling pressures, pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac output. The patient's ECHO demonstrated an EF of 15-20% and moderate symmetric LVH.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, but he was unaware of this diagnosis. He has a family history of hypertension and cardiac disease. The patient's social history is significant for occasional heavy alcohol use and tobacco use.

The patient's physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 123/70 mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. His lung fields were clear, and his abdomen was soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results showed a WBC count of 13.3 K/uL, Hct of 42.9%, and a troponin level of 0.017. His ECHO demonstrated an EF of 15% and moderate symmetric LVH. His cardiac catheterization revealed elevated filling pressures, pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac output.

The patient's plan is to attempt blood pressure control and start long-term CHF medications to improve his EF. He will be started on lisinopril 40 mg po qd, nifidipine CR 30 mg qd, and diuresis with Lasix 40 mg IV. He will also be evaluated for other causes of cardiomyopathy, including thyroid function tests and HIV serology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and he may require further management to control his hypertension.
2. Systolic heart failure: The patient's EF is 15%, which is significantly decreased. He may require further management to improve his cardiac function.
3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's ECHO demonstrated moderate symmetric LVH, which may indicate cardiomyopathy.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypertension, which may indicate right ventricular failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, which may put him at risk for renal failure.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be evaluated and managed accordingly.
7. Pheochromocytoma: The patient's hypertension and elevated catecholamines may indicate a pheochromocytoma, which needs to be evaluated and managed accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital for management of a hypertensive emergency with systolic heart failure. The patient has a history of hypertension and is suspected to have cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, possibly related to hypertension or alcohol use.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T max 37.3°C, T current 36.7°C, HR 90 bpm, BP 153/90 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2 96%.
* Physical examination: The patient is sitting up, with JVD 2 inches above the clavicle, no neck masses or lymphadenopathy, and RRR with an S3 gallop. The patient has crackles in the lungs, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 13.3, Hct is 41.0%, and platelet count is 252 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL. The patient's TSH level is 0.96, and the patient is negative for HIV.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Subacute systolic heart failure with a low EF and SOB for 1 month.
* Cardiomyopathy with unclear etiology, with a workup negative for amyloid, hemochromatosis, thyroid, and HIV.
* ECHO demonstrated EF 15-20% and moderate symmetric LVH.
* Cath showed mild diffuse disease with elevated left and right-sided diastolic filling pressures but no focal lesions.
* The patient is being treated with lisinopril 40 mg PO qd, carvedilol 12.5 PO bid, and a low-salt diet.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of systolic heart failure
* Development of atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias
* Hypertensive crisis
* Pulmonary edema
* Renal failure
* Infection, particularly given the patient's history of hypertension and cardiomyopathy
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and history of hypertension
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer disease

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is being considered for discharge to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency and systolic heart failure. He underwent a cardiac catheterization with clean arteries and was started on medications including Lisinopril, Carvedilol, and a low-salt diet. His labs show mild leukocytosis, elevated troponin, and normal thyroid-stimulating hormone. He has a history of hypertension, obesity, and possible obstructive sleep apnea. His ECG shows sinus rhythm, and his CXR is abnormal with a concern for a superior mediastinal mass.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased symptoms and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be adequately controlled, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or kidney damage.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's mild leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus rhythm may change to a more arrhythmic pattern, leading to cardiac complications such as tachycardia or bradycardia.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's abnormal CXR may indicate a respiratory problem, such as a pulmonary embolism or pneumonia, which could worsen if not managed properly.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's hypertension and potential obstructive sleep apnea may increase his risk of neurological complications such as stroke or transient ischemic attacks.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's low-salt diet and potential use of diuretics may increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications such as diarrhea or constipation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medications as necessary to control his hypertension.
2. Monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm, and adjust medications as necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Consider further testing to determine the cause of the patient's leukocytosis, such as a blood culture or imaging studies.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Consider further testing to determine the cause of the patient's abnormal CXR, such as a CT scan or bronchoscopy.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust medications as necessary to prevent neurological complications.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medications as necessary to prevent gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual weighing 130.2 kg, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a knowledge deficit. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 153/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin and has a 20-gauge central line inserted. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and mild hyponatremia. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. The patient's liver function tests are normal, and the patient's blood glucose level is within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death.
3. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's mild thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymoses, or bleeding gums.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's mild hyponatremia may lead to headaches, nausea, vomiting, or seizures if left untreated.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness if left untreated.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may lead to infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections.
8. Vascular access complications: The patient's central line may be at risk for complications such as infection, thrombosis, or bleeding.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may lead to weight loss, weakness, or impaired wound healing.
10. Medication side effects: The patient's medications may have side effects such as hypertension, hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to control blood pressure and prevent cardiac complications.
3. Provide adequate nutrition and hydration to prevent malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's central line for signs of infection or thrombosis.
5. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or intensivist to further manage the patient's cardiomyopathy and hypertensive crisis.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust the patient's medication regimen as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
7. Consider performing a thorough nutritional assessment and providing supplements as necessary to prevent malnutrition."

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall, 130.2 kg individual admitted to the ICU for catheterization. The patient's 24-hour events include ambulating well, discontinuation of heparin SQ, and an ophthalmoscopic exam showing no signs of hemorrhages, papilledema, or cotton wool spots. The patient's coreg medication was increased to 12.5mg. A CXR revealed an abnormal and concerning superior mediastinal mass. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 90bpm, blood pressure of 153/90mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results show normal kidney function, normal liver function, and mild anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis, which can lead to cardiac complications, including cardiomyopathy.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and the presence of hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac failure and arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of malignancy and the presence of a superior mediastinal mass increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's abnormal CXR and respiratory support with oxygen therapy suggest a risk of respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and the presence of hypertension increase the risk of neurological complications, including stroke and seizures.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheter and respiratory support increase the risk of infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient's history of heparin use and the presence of a superior mediastinal mass increase the risk of bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and respiratory status. The patient's hypertension should be carefully managed to prevent hypertensive crisis. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for signs of cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure. The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for signs of neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 50-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for a catheterization due to a hypertensive emergency with systolic heart failure. He has a history of hypertension and is suspected to have systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The patient has undergone a catheterization, which showed mild diffuse disease with elevated left and right-sided diastolic filling pressures, but no focal lesions. He has been started on medications such as lisinopril, carvedilol, and a low-salt diet.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 153/90 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's cardiac output is 4.2 L/min, and his central venous pressure is 12 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Jugular venous distension 2 inches above the clavicle
* No neck masses or lymphadenopathy
* Rhythm: Sinus
* Lung examination: Crackles way up posteriorly
* Abdominal examination: Soft and nontender

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Complete blood count: WBC 13.3 x 10^9/L, Hct 42.9%, Plt 245 x 10^9/L
* Electrolytes: Na 143 mmol/L, K 4.0 mmol/L, Cl 107 mmol/L
* Renal function: Cr 1.2 mg/dL
* Liver function: ALT 71 U/L, AST 23 U/L, Alk Phos 48 U/L, T Bili 2.4 mg/dL
* Amylase and lipase: 36 and 36 U/L, respectively
* Lipid profile: LDL 66 mg/dL, HDL 29 mg/dL, TG 113 mg/dL, Chol 118 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Hypertensive emergency with systolic heart failure
* Cardiomyopathy with unclear etiology
* Coronary artery disease
* Leukocytosis
* Respiratory failure
* Infection
* Thrombosis

Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely etiology of his hypertension is primary hypertension, confounded by possible obstructive sleep apnea and obesity. The patient's urine catecholamines are pending to evaluate for pheochromocytoma."
