You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF). She has been diagnosed with ARDS, septic shock, and ATN. Her laboratory results show liver dysfunction, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis. She has been started on CVVH and is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive liver dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to further coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and bleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to multi-organ failure, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ATN may progress, leading to worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalance, and acidosis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure, including hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Infection: The patient's septic shock may be caused by an underlying infection, which may not be fully treated, leading to further complications.
7. Portal vein thrombus: The patient's nonocclusive portal vein thrombus may progress, leading to further liver dysfunction and bleeding.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to further cardiac and neurological complications.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's shock and cardiac dysfunction may lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias.

These potential medical complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
* Heart rate: 92 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 95/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving vasopressors, including norepinephrine, to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. Her urine output is oliguric, and she has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.8 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 71 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 115 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Septic shock, likely caused by MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, or pancolitis
* Acute hepatic failure
* Respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS
* Renal failure, potentially due to ATN, hepatorenal syndrome, or complement-induced glomerulonephritis
* Altered mental status, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, or hypoxia
* Anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to lactate production
* Hepatitis, likely due to EtOH, with possible components of shock

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Endocarditis, given the patient's MSSA bacteremia and positive blood culture
* Pneumonia, given the patient's respiratory failure and possible ARDS
* Sepsis, given the patient's septic shock and multiple possible sources of infection
* Renal failure, potentially due to ATN, hepatorenal syndrome, or complement-induced glomerulonephritis
* Hepatic encephalopathy, given the patient's altered mental status and possible hepatic failure
* Metabolic acidosis, potentially due to lactate production or other metabolic derangements
* DVT, given the patient's immobilization and risk factors for thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - cont Zosyn for broad coverage including MSSA bacteremia
   - Add IV vanco to broaden coverage given unclear failure to improve
   despite appropriate antibiotics
   - Resend blood, sputum, urine cx and follow-up OSH blood, urine and
   sputum cultures
   - TTE, TEE if needed
   - repeat CT abdomen/pelvis here
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   .
   # Respiratory failure: patient became hypoxic and intubated in the
   setting of oliguric renal failure, volume challenge with FFP, and
   trendelenberg positioning for line placement.  Most likely etiologies
   include aspiration and flash pulmonary edema.  CXR now with bilateral
   pulmonary infiltrates. PaO2/FiO2 64/.55 w/PEEP 15. Could not get PCWP
   at OSH but presumably now with ARDS d/t aspiration and shock.
   - ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs
   - wean FiO2 if possible
   - PEEP to maintain PaO2>60
   - check CXR now
   - TTE here
   .
   # Renal failure: ATN in setting of hypotension vs hepatorenal
   syndrome.  Could also consider complement induced glomerulonephritis if
   concern for endocarditis given MSSA bacteremia. Oliguric at OSH w/[**4-10**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has since been transferred to the ICU due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 38.1°C, HR: 92 bpm, BP: 95/50 mmHg, RR: 32 breaths/min, SpO2: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAP: 65 mmHg, CVP: 8-12 mmHg
* Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation with PEEP 12 cmH2O, FiO2 100%, VT 400 mL, RR 32 breaths/min
* Renal function: Oliguric with a urine output of 51 mL over 24 hours
* Liver function: Elevated bilirubin and transaminases
* Coagulation profile: PT 21.7 seconds, PTT 54.0 seconds, INR 2.1
* Blood cultures: Positive for MSSA bacteremia
* Chest X-ray: Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest septic shock, which is likely due to MSSA bacteremia or other infectious sources.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 64/0.55 suggest ARDS, which may be due to aspiration, flash pulmonary edema, or shock.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's oliguric renal failure and elevated creatinine suggest ATN, which may be due to hypotension or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and elevated bilirubin suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which may be due to liver failure or other metabolic derangements.
5. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated anion gap and lactate level suggest metabolic acidosis, which may be due to shock, renal failure, or other metabolic derangements.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for MSSA bacteremia
2. Mechanical ventilation with PEEP 12 cmH2O and FiO2 100%
3. Renal replacement therapy with CVVH
4. Liver support therapy with lactulose and rifaximin
5. Monitoring of blood cultures and chest X-rays
6. Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
7. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
8. Communication with interdisciplinary rounds and ICU code status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's medical history includes EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (normal range: 76-94 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/50 mmHg (normal range: 75-135/41-102 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute (normal range: 0-36 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.28, a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 121 mmHg, and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 80 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 4.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 113 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: P/F ratio consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Shock: likely septic in the setting of fevers, multiple possible sources including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, Escherichia coli urinary tract infection (UTI), and pancolitis of unclear etiology
* Renal failure: acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension versus hepatorenal syndrome
* Hepatitis: likely alcoholic, with component of shock
* Portal vein thrombus: nonocclusive

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* Calcium gluconate (CRRT)
* Cisatracurium
* Norepinephrine
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Other medications as needed

The patient's plan includes:

* ARDSNET ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg IBW and a goal peak pressure of <30
* Weaning of FiO2 to 50% and then down to the PEEP
* Running of the patient negative on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to ensure no element of fluid overload
* Continuing Levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12
* Following up on C. difficile antigen, blood, sputum, and urine cultures
* Continuing Vanc/Zosyn
* Following up on OSH blood, urine, and sputum cultures
* Considering repeat CT abdomen/pelvis when stable
* Weaning of pressors
* Following up on urine cultures and lytes

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of ARDS, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Shock: worsening of septic shock, development of organ failure
* Renal failure: worsening of ATN, development of chronic kidney disease
* Hepatitis: worsening of liver failure, development of portal hypertension
* Portal vein thrombus: worsening of thrombosis, development of portal hypertension
* Infections: development of sepsis, pneumonia, or other infections
* Bleeding: development of bleeding complications due to coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction
* Cardiovascular complications: development of arrhythmias, heart failure, or other cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 80%. Her respiratory support is being managed with an endotracheal tube, and she is receiving vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mmHg.

The patient has a positive blood culture, which is concerning for endocarditis. She is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and her blood, urine, and sputum cultures are being monitored. A surveillance culture is also being performed.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with a bilirubin level of 7.9 mg/dL and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0. Her coagulation profile is also abnormal, with a platelet count of 80,000/μL.

The patient has a portal vein thrombus, which is being monitored. Her anion gap metabolic acidosis has improved, and she is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage her electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 80%. She is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
2. Shock: The patient is receiving vasopressors to maintain a MAP greater than 65 mmHg. She has a positive blood culture, which is concerning for sepsis and endocarditis.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 22 mL/min. She is receiving CVVH to manage her electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hepatitis: The patient has a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, and her LFTs are abnormal. She is at risk for liver failure and encephalopathy.
5. Portal vein thrombus: The patient has a portal vein thrombus, which is being monitored. She is at risk for bleeding and liver failure.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a positive blood culture, which is concerning for endocarditis. She is at risk for sepsis, cardiac failure, and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture, which is concerning for sepsis. She is at risk for multi-organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving PPV, which increases her risk for respiratory failure and VAP.
4. Liver failure: The patient has a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, and her LFTs are abnormal. She is at risk for liver failure and encephalopathy.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a portal vein thrombus, which is being monitored. She is at risk for bleeding and liver failure.

In summary, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and ARF. She has a positive blood culture, which is concerning for endocarditis, and is receiving antibiotics and vasopressors. Her liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a portal vein thrombus. She is at risk for respiratory failure, liver failure, and bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 121 mmHg and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 360 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 70 IU/L. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 21.6 seconds and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0.

The patient's fluid balance is slightly positive, with a total fluid input of 3,968 mL and a total fluid output of 3,987 mL. The patient's urine output is low, with a total output of 36 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute liver failure.
2. Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Renal failure, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
4. Liver failure, including acute liver failure and chronic liver disease.
5. Coagulopathy, including bleeding complications and increased risk of thrombosis.
6. Metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis.
7. Hypoglycemia, including insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.
8. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.
9. Cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
10. Infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a pleural effusion on the left side and is suspected to have septic shock due to fevers and possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis. She is also experiencing ARF, likely due to ATN or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a portal vein thrombus and is being treated with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and cardiac output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's fevers and possible sources of infection increase the risk of septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's P/F ratio is consistent with ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's ATN or hepatorenal syndrome can progress to AKI, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
4. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient's portal vein thrombus can lead to portal hypertension, which can cause bleeding, ascites, and liver failure.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
6. Infection: The patient's possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis, can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction.
7. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and portal vein thrombus can increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock and death.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's vasopressors can increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and myocardial infarction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 14 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Her oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient has a history of septic shock, with fevers since November 21st, and multiple possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. She has a positive blood culture concerning for endocarditis and is receiving Levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with ATN in the setting of hypotension and possible hepatorenal syndrome. She is oliguric and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient's liver function is impaired, with elevated total bilirubin (T.bili) levels, and she has a history of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: Given the patient's history of septic shock and the presence of multiple potential sources of infection, there is a high risk of sepsis and septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for dialysis.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for liver transplantation.
5. Endocarditis: The patient's positive blood culture concerning for endocarditis is a potential source of infection and can lead to further complications.
6. Portal vein thrombus: The patient's portal vein thrombus can lead to further complications, including liver failure and portal hypertension.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Given the patient's complex medical status, it is essential to continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, ARDS, and ARF.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a P/F ratio consistent with ARDS. She is receiving ARDSNET ventilation with a goal peak pressure of less than 30.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient is in shock, likely due to sepsis, and is receiving vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure greater than 65.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
* Hepatic status: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus, and her liver function tests are abnormal.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, and her hemoglobin level is 7.1 g/dL.
* Coagulation status: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0.
* Infections: The patient has a positive blood culture, and there is concern for endocarditis. She is also being monitored for other potential sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of multiple potential sources of infection.
* ARDS: The patient's P/F ratio is consistent with ARDS, and she is at risk for developing further respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is abnormal, and she is at risk for developing further liver failure.
* Endocarditis: The patient's positive blood culture and concern for endocarditis put her at risk for developing a serious infection.
* Portal vein thrombus: The patient's portal vein thrombus may progress to a more severe condition if not managed properly.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued surveillance for potential sources of infection
* Management of shock and vasopressors
* Continuous renal replacement therapy
* Monitoring of liver function and coagulation status
* Management of anemia
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Daily interdisciplinary rounds to monitor the patient's progress and adjust her treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple complex medical conditions. The patient's primary diagnoses include cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is being supported with mechanical ventilation, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with a total bilirubin level of 22 mg/dL and a prothrombin time (PT) of 21.5 seconds. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 10.3 mL/min.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. The patient is also receiving nutrition support, with a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of pleural edema on the left side, which is worse compared to yesterday. The patient's microbiology results are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver failure, and respiratory failure.
2. ARDS-related respiratory failure, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
4. Liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, or urinary tract infections.
6. Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure.
7. Neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, seizures, or stroke.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   .
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology.
   Improved ventilation w/ negative fluid balance.  Continue to run net
   negative.
   - ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs
   - goal peak pressures <30
   - plan to wean down the PEEP today as tolerated in preparation for
   PSupport
   - will run her negative on CVVH today
   - q8h ABGs

   - continue levophed and vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12 and
   wean as tolerated
   - f/u C diff antigen, blood, sputum, urine cx
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - TTE reveals normal Biventricular function, w/o evidence of
   endocarditis -> consider TEE while intubated to r/o vegetations
   although ongoing cultures negative.
   - plan for CT abdomen/pelvis here when stable to eval fluid collection
   -> too unstable to leave for CT at this time.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent Oliguria
   w/5-10 cc UOP/h.  Further mgmt as per renal team - ? need for HD in

   # Mental Status: off sedation with minimal responsiveness, but
   improving alertness over last 12 hours.  would consider head CT and
   neuro evaluation if mental status does not continue to improve.  Will
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - head CT when able if mental status not improving.
   - follow mental status, and consider neuro consult for prognosis if
   does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Resend hemolysis labs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF, and was intubated on pressors and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is currently receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain her mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL and a respiratory rate (RR) of 29 breaths per minute.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 22 mg/dL. She is receiving CVVH and is being closely monitored for signs of renal recovery.

The patient's mental status is improving, but she remains minimally responsive. She is being closely monitored for signs of neurological deterioration and is being considered for a head computed tomography (CT) scan and neurologic consultation if her mental status does not continue to improve.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as an elevated bilirubin level. She is being closely monitored for signs of liver failure and is being considered for paracentesis to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's abdominal distension is thought to be related to constipation and is being managed with a bowel regimen. She is being closely monitored for signs of abdominal compartment syndrome.

The patient's portal vein thrombus is nonocclusive and is being managed with anticoagulation therapy. She is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding or worsening portal hypertension.

The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting is planned to discuss her overall plan of care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis may worsen, leading to liver failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction.
5. Bleeding: The patient's portal vein thrombus may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's mental status may worsen, leading to neurological complications.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension may worsen, leading to abdominal compartment syndrome.
8. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's risk of venous thromboembolism is increased due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute renal failure, and hemolytic anemia.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. She is also receiving vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 65 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and anemia. Her blood cultures are negative, but she has a history of MSSA bacteremia and E coli urinary tract infection.

The patient's imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, show evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus.

The patient's goals of care include discussing the overall plan with the family and will depend on her mental status. The plan is to meet with the family on [**2123-12-1**].

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is still receiving antibiotics, but there is a risk of ongoing or recurrent sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further kidney injury or worsening of her renal function.
4. Hemolytic anemia: The patient has a history of hemolytic anemia, and there is a risk of further anemia or worsening of her hemolytic anemia.
5. Portal hypertension: The patient has cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus, which increases the risk of portal hypertension and its complications.
6. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has abdominal distension and a risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome.
7. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, and there is a risk of developing endocarditis.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should receive close monitoring, aggressive treatment of her underlying conditions, and careful management of her fluid and electrolyte balance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute hepatic failure, cirrhosis, and altered mental status. She has developed severe sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and respiratory failure. She has a history of ethanol-induced hepatitis and cirrhosis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 93 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 109/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 74 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 22 mEq/L
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Liver function tests (LFTs): elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are:

* Hemolytic anemia
* Cirrhosis of the liver
* ARDS
* Sepsis, severe
* ARF
* Respiratory failure
* Shock
* Portal vein thrombus
* Abdominal distension
* Potential endocarditis
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* Hepatitis, likely ethanol-induced

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of mental status and consideration of neuro consult
* ARDSNET ventilation and weaning of PEEP
* Negative fluid balance and CVVH
* Shock management with vasopressors and surveillance cultures
* Renal consultation and consideration of dialysis
* Anemia management with transfusions and iron studies
* Hepatitis evaluation with serologies and consideration of paracentesis
* Abdominal distension monitoring and potential paracentesis
* Portal vein thrombus management with hold on anticoagulation
* Family meeting to discuss overall plan and goals of care

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory status
* Development of endocarditis or other infections
* Progression of ARF to chronic kidney disease
* Hemolytic anemia worsening
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Abdominal compartment syndrome
* Portal vein thrombosis worsening
* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions, and to adjust her plan of care accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and acute hepatic failure. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of her condition. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/48 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia, hemolytic anemia, and cirrhosis of the liver. She is also experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is thought to be related to ARDS. The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for management of her acute renal failure.

The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but she remains minimally responsive. She is at risk for developing a hepatic encephalopathy, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated. The patient's abdomen is distended, and she has a nonocclusive portal vein thrombus.

The patient's care plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, CVVH, and vasopressor support. She is also receiving antibiotics for management of her septic shock. The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has been advised to meet with the healthcare team to discuss her overall plan of care.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is at risk for developing a hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
2. ARDS: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition that can lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. ARF: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is a life-threatening condition that can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
4. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and death.
5. Portal vein thrombus: The patient's nonocclusive portal vein thrombus is a risk factor for portal hypertension and liver failure.
6. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's distended abdomen is a risk factor for abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
7. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hemolytic anemia is a risk factor for anemia, which can lead to cardiovascular compromise and death.
8. Infection: The patient's septic shock is a risk factor for infection, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and CVVH to manage the patient's ARDS and ARF.
2. Continue vasopressor support to manage the patient's septic shock.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her care plan accordingly.

   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now transferred to
   [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors and CVVH.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology.
   Improved ventilation w/ negative fluid balance.  Continue to run net
   negative.  ABG stable, weaning PEEP and now tolerating PSupport.  As
   mental status improves can consider extubation.
   - ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs
   - goal peak pressures <30
   - plan to wean down the PEEP today as tolerated in preparation for
   PSupport
   - will run her negative on CVVH today
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - consider TEE
   - positive blood cx concerning for endocarditis so would continue
   surveillance cx although now negative.
   - continue levophed and vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12 and
   wean as tolerated
   - f/u C diff antigen, blood, sputum, urine cx
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - TTE reveals normal Biventricular function, w/o evidence of
   endocarditis -> consider TEE while intubated to r/o vegetations
   although ongoing cultures negative.
   - plan for CT abdomen/pelvis here when stable to eval fluid collection
   -> too unstable to leave for CT at this time.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent Oliguria
   w/5-10 cc UOP/h.  Further mgmt as per renal team - ? need for HD in
   long run if acute episode resolves.
   - cont CVVH
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - renal consulted, appreciate their input
   .
   # Mental Status: off sedation with minimal responsiveness, but
   improving alertness over last 12 hours.  would consider head CT and
   neuro evaluation if mental status does not continue to improve.  Will
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - head CT when able if mental status not improving.
   - follow mental status, and consider neuro consult for prognosis if
   does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Resend hemolysis labs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCTs
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, maintain net out
   - Iron studies, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: alcoholic most likley w/component of shock. U/S w/evidence
   of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: send Hep serologies
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - f/u OSH HIV antibodies
   - appreciate liver input
   - daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - consider paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point
   given on antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: KUB yesterday FOS, repeat today, consider
   bowel rest, stopping tube feeds and starting TPN for nutrition
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: nonocclusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Need family meeting to discuss overall plan. will

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, and acute liver failure. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for volume overload and is currently intubated on pressors and undergoing continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). Her mental status is improving slowly, and she is receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for continued sepsis due to the presence of multiple potential sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is likely to be severe and may require continued mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to be due to ATN and may require continued CVVH and close monitoring of her electrolyte levels.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's acute liver failure may require continued close monitoring of her liver function tests and coagulation studies.
5. Ileus/Abdominal Distension: The patient's ileus and abdominal distension may require continued bowel rest, stopping of tube feeds, and starting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition.
6. Portal Vein Thrombus: The patient's nonocclusive portal vein thrombus may require close monitoring and consideration of anticoagulation therapy in the future.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require transfusion for hemoglobin levels <21 and continued close monitoring of her hemolysis labs.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is improving slowly, and she may require continued close monitoring and consideration of neuro consult for prognosis if her mental status does not continue to improve.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for suspected sepsis and consider adding antifungal therapy if the patient's condition does not improve.
2. Continue mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support for ARDS and septic shock.
3. Continue CVVH for acute renal failure and close monitoring of electrolyte levels.
4. Continue close monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation studies for hepatic failure.
5. Consider paracentesis for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
6. Consider anticoagulation therapy for portal vein thrombus in the future.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusion for hemoglobin levels <21.
8. Continue close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and consider neuro consult for prognosis if her mental status does not continue to improve."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with acute hepatic failure , thought secondary to
   etoh. Course complicated by ARDS and MODS. Still with low P:F, would
   favor AC with low tidal volume ventilation
   as long as she tolerates it off sedation. continues on CVVH for ARF.
   Hypotension secondary to distributive shock, on borad spectrum
   antibiotic with only positive culture being 1 bld culture of MSSA. Abx
   as per resident note. Weaning Norepi and vasopressin with goal MAP >
   60. As long as pressore coming down, agree with running CVVH slightly
   negative in effort to improve oxygenation. Further plans
   as per resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute hepatic failure, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) secondary to etoh. She is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 467 mL and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg. She is receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine to support her blood pressure. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of pneumonia is high due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of a foreign body (endotracheal tube) in her airway.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and hepatic function.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's acute hepatic failure could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which could affect her mental status and increase her risk of complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) could progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and liver dysfunction increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen her respiratory status and lead to further complications.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressor support increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
7. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's immobility and prolonged hospitalization increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, which could worsen her respiratory status and lead to further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to her regimen to prevent pneumonia and sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and coagulation profile closely to assess the effectiveness of her treatment.
4. Consider adding a proton pump inhibitor to her regimen to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust her vasopressor support as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
6. Consider adding a thromboprophylaxis regimen to her regimen to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
7. Schedule a family meeting to discuss the patient's treatment plan and prognosis with her family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with acute respiratory failure, acute hepatic failure, and acute kidney injury. She has been in the ICU for several days and is receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Her vital signs are stable, but she has a high respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation. Her physical examination is notable for bilateral rhonchorous breath sounds and a systolic murmur. Her laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies show bibasilar airspace opacities.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires mechanical ventilation to maintain oxygenation. She may be at risk for further respiratory deterioration, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, which may lead to further complications, including coagulopathy, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased clearance of medications.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is impaired, which may lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and decreased clearance of waste products.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), which may indicate sepsis. She may be at risk for further sepsis complications, including organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she is receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. She may be at risk for further cardiovascular instability, including hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic status is stable, but she may be at risk for further complications, including seizures, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure.
7. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture, and she may be at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and urinary tract infection.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent further complications and improve her chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman who was transferred to the ICU with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF), and Acute Hepatic Failure (AHF). She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, and her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/47 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.5 K/uL
* Hct: 21.2%
* Plt: 59 K/uL
* Cr: 1.2 mg/dL
* TCO2: 23 mmol/L
* Glucose: 119 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 22.4/59.9/2.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 28//, ALT / AST: 103/393, Alk Phos / T Bili: 107/24.7, Amylase / Lipase: /41, Differential-Neuts: 84.0%, Lymph: 13.3%, Mono: 1.7%, Eos: 0.7%, Fibrinogen: 499 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.6 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.4 g/dL, LDH: 345 IU/L, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show bibasilar airspace opacification.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute hepatic failure thought to be secondary to ethanol
* Course complicated by ARDS and Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)
* Still with low P:F, favoring AC with low tidal volume ventilation
* Continues on Continuous Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) for ARF
* Hypotension secondary to distributive shock, on broad-spectrum antibiotic with only positive culture being 1 blood culture of Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA)
* Weaning Norepinephrine and vasopressin with goal Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) > 60
* Running CVVH slightly negative in effort to improve oxygenation

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function, leading to increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Progression of liver failure, leading to increased risk of bleeding and coagulopathy
* Development of sepsis or septic shock, particularly with the positive culture of MSSA
* Worsening of acute kidney injury, leading to increased risk of dialysis dependence
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and prolonged hospital stay."

   [**11-28**] C. Difficile toxin negative
   Otherwise no new culture data
   Imaging:
   [**11-30**] Chest x-ray: Read pending
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance.
   Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Has been off all sedation for >36  hours.  Will likely
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   -          Follow mental status, and consider head CT/neuro consult for
   prognosis if does not improve.
   -          Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 23 (up from 21). Elevated T.bili, D. bili
   9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies pending here.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool yesterday after initiation of reglan.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family today
[**12-1**]^st will work best
   for all family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will
   get back to us with convenient time in the afternoon for 1/109.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance.
   Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Has been off all sedation for >36  hours.  Will likely
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   -          Follow mental status, and consider head CT/neuro consult for
   prognosis if does not improve.
   -          Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 23 (up from 21). Elevated T.bili, D. bili
   9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies pending here.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool yesterday after initiation of reglan.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family today
[**12-1**]^st will work best
   for all family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, and shock. She has been intubated and is receiving vasopressin and CVVH. Her mental status has been improving over the past 24 hours, and she is attempting to follow some commands. She has been weaned off sedation and is expected to be slow to recover due to toxic and metabolic derangements.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: She has ARDS and is on ventilator support with a goal of decreasing ventilatory support.
2. Shock: She has septic shock and is receiving vasopressin to maintain blood pressure.
3. Renal failure: She has ATN and is receiving CVVH.
4. Hepatitis: She has suspected alcoholic hepatitis with component of shock.
5. Anemia: She has stable anemia with HCT 23.
6. Ileus/Abdominal distension: She has improved significantly with initiation of Reglan.
7. Portal vein thrombus: She has a non-occlusive thrombus and is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ATN may worsen, leading to further kidney damage.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function may deteriorate further, leading to coagulopathy and other complications.
5. Infections: The patient may develop further infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated INR may lead to bleeding complications.
7. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension may worsen, leading to abdominal compartment syndrome.

The patient's goals of care include weaning off pressors, transitioning to HD as needed, and improving her mental status. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is intubated and receiving pressors and CVVH. The patient's condition has improved over the past 24 hours, with improved ventilation and a negative fluid balance. However, she remains critically ill, with ongoing septic shock, ARDS, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely due to multiple possible sources, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. Continued monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage this complication.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is thought to be secondary to sepsis, and she is receiving ARDSNET ventilation to manage her respiratory failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to ATN in the setting of shock. Continued CVVH and close monitoring of her renal function are necessary to manage this complication.
4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving, but she remains minimally responsive. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage this complication.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to hemolysis, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage this complication.
6. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis is likely due to EtOH hepatitis, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage this complication.
7. Portal Vein Thrombus: The patient's portal vein thrombus is nonocclusive, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage this complication.
8. Ileus/Abdominal Distension: The patient's ileus and abdominal distension are likely due to her critical illness and may require further evaluation and treatment.
9. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient is at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome, and close monitoring is necessary to manage this complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition.
2. Continue to manage the patient's septic shock with pressors and CVVH.
3. Continue to manage the patient's ARDS with ARDSNET ventilation.
4. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with CVVH and close monitoring of her renal function.
5. Continue to evaluate and treat the patient's anemia, hepatitis, and portal vein thrombus.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
7. Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's overall plan and goals of care.
8. Consider a CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate the patient's abdominal distension and potential fluid collection.
9. Consider a paracentesis for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the 24-hour events and the patient's current status, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/46 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving vasopressin, calcium gluconate, and KCl through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
* The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator in CPAP/PSV mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, the liver enzymes are elevated, with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 381 and 108 IU/L, respectively.
* The patient's microbiologic data shows that Clostridioides difficile toxin testing was negative.
* The patient's imaging studies are pending, including a chest x-ray.
* The patient's nutrition is being provided through a full-strength renal diet, and glycemic control is being monitored.
* The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen catheter.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's elevated liver enzymes and the presence of multiple lines.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory support requirements.
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's vasopressor therapy.
* Renal failure due to the patient's ongoing dialysis therapy.
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's elevated liver enzymes and the presence of Clostridioides difficile toxin.
* Infections due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of multiple lines.
* Hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's coagulopathy and the presence of multiple lines.

These potential complications will need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent Oliguria
   .  Further mgmt as per renal team - ? need for HD in long run if acute
   episode resolves.
   - cont CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement
   hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as pressor
   requirement does not increase
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - renal consulted, appreciate their input
   .
   # Mental Status: off sedation with minimal responsiveness, but
   improving alertness over last 24 hours.  would consider head CT and
   neuro evaluation if mental status does not continue to improve.  Will
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - head CT when able if mental status not improving.
   - follow mental status, and consider neuro consult for prognosis if
   does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Resend hemolysis labs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCTs
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, maintain net out
   - Iron studies, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: alcoholic most likley w/component of shock. U/S w/evidence
   of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

24 Hour Events:
   - Discussed placement of central line, and decision made that it was
   okay to continue to use, not to re-site.
   - Outside hospital called for hepatitis serologies, culture data;
   outside hospital was unsure if they were drawn, so re-ordered here.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and requires ventilatory support. Although the patient's oxygenation has improved, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's ARDS is not adequately managed.
2. Shock: The patient has septic shock, and there is a risk of further deterioration if the underlying infection is not effectively treated. The patient's vasopressor requirements are still high, and there is a risk of worsening organ dysfunction if the pressors are not weaned off gradually.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (ATN) and requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). There is a risk of worsening renal function if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled, and the patient may require hemodialysis in the long run.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and may be at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, particularly if the patient's liver function does not improve.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has ileus and abdominal distension, which can lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscesses. The patient's risk of developing gastrointestinal complications is increased due to the use of antibiotics and the presence of a central line.
6. Infection: The patient has a central line and is at risk of developing a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The patient's risk of developing a CLABSI is increased due to the presence of a central line and the patient's immunocompromised state.
7. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia and an elevated INR, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's risk of bleeding is increased due to the use of anticoagulants and the patient's liver dysfunction.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of liver disease and may be at risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy, particularly if the patient's liver function does not improve.

To mitigate these complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilatory support as necessary.
2. Wean the patient off vasopressors gradually to prevent worsening organ dysfunction.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust CVVH settings as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
6. Take precautions to prevent CLABSI, such as using sterile technique when inserting or removing central lines.
7. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust anticoagulant therapy as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent neurological complications."

   Otherwise no new culture data
   Imaging:
   [**11-30**] Chest x-ray: Read pending
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance.
   Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Has been off all sedation for >36  hours.  Will likely
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and consider head CT/neuro consult for
   prognosis if does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 23 (up from 21). Elevated T.bili, D. bili
   9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likley w/component of shock. U/S
   w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: f/u Hep serologies from OSH
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - f/u OSH HIV antibodies
   - appreciate liver input
   - daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - consider paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point
   given on antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: KUB yesterday FOS, repeat today, continue
   tube feeds, add motility agents with raglan today.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: nonocclusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Need family meeting to discuss overall plan. will
   depend on mental status.  Plan to meet on [**2123-12-1**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]

   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance.
   Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Has been off all sedation for >36  hours.  Will likely
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and consider head CT/neuro consult for
   prognosis if does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 23 (up from 21). Elevated T.bili, D. bili
   9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been intubated and is receiving vasopressin and CVVH. Over the past 24 hours, her mental status has improved, and her respiratory status has improved, with decreased ventilatory support needed. However, she remains at risk for septic shock, ARF, and bleeding due to her underlying liver disease and ongoing infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for septic shock due to her underlying liver disease, ongoing infection, and fevers since November 21st.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is likely to remain impaired due to ATN in the setting of shock, and she may require ongoing CVVH and potential transition to HD.
3. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia put her at risk for bleeding, particularly with the need for invasive procedures and medications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and ongoing infection may lead to worsening hepatic encephalopathy, which could impact her mental status and overall prognosis.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and ongoing infection may lead to worsening respiratory failure, particularly if her ARDS does not improve.
6. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension and ileus may increase her risk for abdominal compartment syndrome, which could have serious consequences if not managed promptly.
7. Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient's portal vein thrombus may worsen if not managed properly, potentially leading to further liver damage and complications.
8. Infection: The patient's ongoing infection and risk for sepsis make her at risk for further complications, including organ failure and death.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning off vasopressin and aiming to maintain MAP > 65
* Continuing CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement
* Monitoring for evidence of bleeding and coagulopathy
* Managing her mental status with ongoing sedation and pain management
* Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory failure and adjusting ventilatory support as needed
* Managing her abdominal distension and ileus with bowel regimen and motility agents
* Continuing to monitor for signs of worsening liver disease and adjusting therapy as needed

The patient's family meeting is scheduled for December 1st to discuss her overall plan of care and goals."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with acute etoh hepatitis and MODS. Respiratory
   function is improving with P/F now greater than 200. RISBI 66 this am.
   Will attempt
   SBT today but remain concerned that mental status will prohibit
   extubation. Continues on vasopressin but levophed off. Will run CVVH
   even
   today in hopes of getting her off pressors entirely. More awake today
   with non-focal exam , so suspect altered mental status is secondary to
   sedation and not
   structural lesion. Continue off of sedation. Hepatic function remains
   poor as evidenced by INR which is a poor prognostic factor despite
   improvement in other
   organ failures. Continues on lactulose and viral studies pending to
   complete w/u of acute hepatitis. Further plans as per resident.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with acute etoh hepatitis and MODS. Respiratory
   function is improving with P/F now greater than 200. RISBI 66 this am.
   Will attempt
   SBT today but remain concerned that mental status will prohibit
   extubation. Continues on vasopressin but levophed off. Will run CVVH
   even
   today in hopes of getting her off pressors entirely. More awake today
   with non-focal exam , so suspect altered mental status is secondary to
   sedation and not
   structural lesion. Continue off of sedation. Hepatic function remains
   poor as evidenced by INR which is a poor prognostic factor despite
   improvement in other
   organ failures. Continues on lactulose and viral studies pending to
   complete w/u of acute hepatitis. Further plans as per resident.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 30 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman who was transferred from the operating room (OSH) with acute hepatic failure and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for shock, respiratory failure, and other complications.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 91/41 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving vasopressin infusions and has a fluid balance of -2,106 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 57 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 103 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, distant.
* Respiratory: Rhonchorous breath sounds.
* Abdominal: Soft and non-tender.
* Neurologic: Responds to verbal stimuli, movement is purposeful, but tone is not assessed.

The patient's respiratory support includes:

* Endotracheal tube
* Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV)
* FiO2: 50%
* PEEP: 8 cmH2O

The patient's plan includes:

* Attempting a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today
* Continuing vasopressin infusions and considering discontinuation of levophed
* Running continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) to help manage fluid balance and potentially reduce the need for vasopressors
* Continuing off of sedation and monitoring the patient's mental status
* Completing a workup for acute hepatitis, including viral studies and lactulose therapy
* Further plans as per the resident.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of liver dysfunction, leading to further decompensation and increased risk of mortality
* Development of sepsis or septic shock, given the patient's MODS and immunosuppressed state
* Respiratory failure, particularly if the patient is not able to be extubated or if there is a delay in weaning from mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular instability, given the patient's hypotension and need for vasopressors
* Neurological complications, such as altered mental status or seizures, given the patient's altered mental status and potential for structural lesions.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support to ensure that any potential complications are identified and managed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with acute etoh hepatitis and MODS. PNA, ARDS.
   Respiratory function is improving with P/F now greater than 200. RSBI
   66 this am. Will attempt SBT today but remain concerned that mental
   status will prohibit extubation. Continues on vasopressin but levophed
   off. Will run CVVH even today in hopes of getting her off pressors
   entirely. More awake today with non-focal exam, so suspect altered
   mental status is secondary to sedation and not structural lesion.
   Continue off of sedation. Hepatic function remains poor as evidenced by
   INR which is a poor prognostic factor despite improvement in other
   organ failures. Continues on lactulose and viral studies pending to
   complete w/u of acute hepatitis. Further plans as per resident.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with acute hepatic failure and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) who was transferred from another hospital. She has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 91/41 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Vasopressin infusion at 2.4 units per hour

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.5 K/uL
* Platelet count: 57 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21 mEq/L
* Glucose: 106 mg/dL
* Liver function tests: Abnormal
* Renal function tests: Abnormal
* Coagulation tests: Abnormal

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: Normal
* Respiratory: Rhonchorous breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft and non-tender
* Neurologic: Responds to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, and altered mental status

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute etoh hepatitis and MODS
* Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Respiratory function is improving, but remains concerned about mental status and extubation
* Continues on vasopressin and lactulose
* Hepatic function remains poor, and further plans are pending

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of liver function and development of liver failure
* Progression of MODS and development of septic shock
* Development of respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Development of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke
* Development of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation
* Development of coagulopathy and bleeding complications
* Development of electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders
* Development of sepsis and septic shock
* Development of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and appears
   to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only slightly negative which
   helped to eliminate pressory need (although she did need pressor again
   while on propofol).  Overnight had some green sputum suctioned.  CXR
   shows possible increased infiltrate in RML.
   - send sputum for culture
   - will not wean vent today given increased sputum production
   - cont Zosyn; may need add
l abx if sputum culture positive
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but now on PS
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-22**], day
   1 treatment [**11-24**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-22**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed only because of propofol, will aim to wean
   off vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-24**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 22.5 (stable). Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9.
   In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and appears
   to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only slightly negative which
   helped to eliminate pressory need (although she did need pressor again
   while on propofol).  Overnight had some green sputum suctioned.  CXR
   shows possible increased infiltrate in RML.
   - send sputum for culture
   - will not wean vent today given increased sputum production
   - cont Zosyn; may need add
l abx if sputum culture positive
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but now on PS
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-22**], day
   1 treatment [**11-24**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-22**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed only because of propofol, will aim to wean
   off vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-24**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 22.5 (stable). Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9.
   In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool  with reglan on board.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She has a history of likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis and has been transferred from another hospital. She is intubated and on pressors, and has been running negative on CVVH. She has had some improvement in her mental status and respiratory status over the past 24 hours. Her sputum production has increased, and she has had some green sputum suctioned. Her CXR shows possible increased infiltrate in the right middle lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has had fevers since November 21st, and has multiple possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. She is at risk for sepsis, which could worsen her respiratory and renal failure.
2. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which is worsening, and is at risk for further deterioration.
3. Renal failure: The patient has anuria/oliguria and is on CVVH. She is at risk for further deterioration of her renal function, and may require hemodialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has elevated bilirubin and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient has abdominal distension and is at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has increased sputum production and is at risk for developing pneumonia.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her intubation and mechanical ventilation.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and presence of central lines.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's sputum production and consider sending it for culture.
2. Wean the patient off propofol and consider extubation.
3. Continue CVVH until the patient is able to tolerate another method of renal replacement.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider hemodialysis if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider a head CT or neuro consult if necessary.
6. Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's portal vein thrombus and consider anticoagulation if necessary.
9. Consider a CT abdomen/pelvis if the patient's abdominal distension worsens.
10. Monitor the patient's abdominal compartment syndrome and consider paracentesis if necessary."

   Urine [**11-22**] - grew Ecoli
   Blood 12/22 - grew MSSA, started treatment [**11-24**]

   Blood [**Date range (1) 4710**]: NGTD

   Stool [**11-24**] & [**11-28**]: Neg for Cdif tox
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and appears
   to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only slightly negative which
   helped to eliminate pressory need (although she did need pressor again
   while on propofol).  Overnight had some green sputum suctioned.
   - send sputum for culture
   - will discuss ability to wean vent with team
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but now on PS as
   trying to wean vent
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-22**], day
   1 treatment [**11-24**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-22**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed only because of propofol, will aim to wean
   off vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-24**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 22.5 (stable). Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9.
   In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool  with reglan on board.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family
[**12-1**] will work best for all
   family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will get back
   to us with convenient time in the afternoon for 1/109.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only slightly negative which
   helped to eliminate pressory need (although she did need pressor again
   while on propofol).  Overnight had some green sputum suctioned.
   - send sputum for culture
   - will discuss ability to wean vent with team
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but now on PS as
   trying to wean vent
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-22**], day
   1 treatment [**11-24**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-22**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed only because of propofol, will aim to wean
   off vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-24**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 22.5 (stable). Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9.
   In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool  with reglan on board.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family
[**12-1**] will work best for all
   family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will get back

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is intubated on pressors and CVVH. Over the past 24 hours, her mental status has improved, and she is attempting to follow commands. Her respiratory status has also improved, and she is being weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been running negative on CVVH, but the possibility of sepsis cannot be ruled out, especially with the presence of fevers and multiple possible sources of infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria and is likely to have ATN. Weaning off pressors and transitioning to HD may be challenging.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has elevated T.bili and D. bili, and is receiving lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Portal Vein Thrombus: The patient has a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus, which may require anticoagulation therapy in the future.
5. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient has improved abdominal distension, but monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome is necessary.
6. Shock: The patient's shock is likely to be septic, and weaning off vasopressors may be challenging.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the presence of ARDS.
8. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis is likely to be alcoholic, but the possibility of other causes cannot be ruled out.

Labs/Radiology:

* Blood cultures have been negative to date, but the patient has MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI.
* Urine cultures have grown E. coli and MSSA.
* Imaging studies have shown persistent cardiac enlargement, slight worsening of diffuse pulmonary opacities, and a small right pleural effusion.
* Liver function tests have shown elevated T.bili and D. bili.
* Coagulation studies have shown elevated INR and thrombocytopenia.
* Renal function tests have shown persistent anuria/oliguria.
* Electrolyte studies have shown elevated potassium and magnesium levels.

Plan:

* Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement.
* Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60.
* Monitor for sepsis and adjust antibiotics accordingly.
* Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy.
* Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome.
* Consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if mental status does not improve.
* Continue to monitor and manage the patient's shock, respiratory failure, and renal failure.
* Consider paracentesis for SBP if the patient develops fevers or clinical status worsens."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with PMH cirrhosis, transferred from OSH with hepatic
   failure and MODS. Doing well on minimal vent setting yesterday but
   increased secretions today so will hold off on extubation. Sputum
   sample sent. Will hold off on additional antibiotics in the absence of
   + gram stain, fever, or leukocytosis. Okay to continue pressure
   support. Continues on CVVH, would aim even for now. Further plans as
   per resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   45 year old woman with PMH cirrhosis, transferred from OSH with hepatic
   failure and MODS. Doing well on minimal vent setting yesterday but
   increased secretions today so will hold off on extubation. Sputum
   sample sent. Will hold off on additional antibiotics in the absence of
   + gram stain, fever, or leukocytosis. Okay to continue pressure
   support. Continues on CVVH, would aim even for now. Further plans as

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis, transferred to the ICU with acute hepatic failure and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been stable on minimal settings, but today, she developed thick secretions, which has led to the decision to hold off on extubation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 118/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her lab results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's MODS and elevated liver enzymes, she is at risk for developing sepsis, which could further compromise her organ function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's thick secretions and requirement for mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could increase her risk of bleeding, particularly if she undergoes invasive procedures or experiences trauma.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly the hypokalemia, could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not addressed promptly.
5. Infection: The patient's presence of possible RML infiltrate on imaging and her MODS increase her risk of developing infections, which could further complicate her condition.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's acute hepatic failure and cirrhosis increase her risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to altered mental status and other complications.
7. Renal failure: The patient's MODS and requirement for dialysis increase her risk of developing renal failure, which could further compromise her overall health.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's requirement for tube feeds and her MODS increase her risk of malnutrition, which could lead to further complications and prolonged recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with PMH chirossis, transfered from OSH with FHF and
   MODS. Doing well on minimal vent setting yesterday but increased
   secretions
   today so will hold off on extubation. Sputum sample sent. Will hold off
   on additional antibiotics in the abscense of + gram stain, fever, or
   leukocystosis.
   Okay to continue pressure support. Continues on CVVH, would aim even
   for now. Further plans as per resident note.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of cholestatic liver disease, transferred from another hospital with acute hepatic failure and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 118/58 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on 50% FiO2. Her laboratory results show liver dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. She has also developed MODS, with acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's MODS and elevated liver enzymes suggest a high risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in her respiratory function.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
6. Infection: The patient's MODS and liver failure make her susceptible to infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of infection.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's liver failure may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's liver failure may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury, infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiovascular complications.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to optimize liver function and prevent complications.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
4. Consider transferring the patient to a liver transplant center if her condition does not improve with medical management.
5. Educate the patient and her family about her condition, treatment options, and potential complications."

   [**11-21**]: Urine Ecoli, treatment completed
   Here Blood, urine, stool cdiff - negative to date
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible VAP
   given increased sputum, although gram stain of sputum negative and
   culutre pending.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - wean vent today, trial of pressure support
   - Stop Zosyn, narrow coverage to  nafcillin to cover MSSA in blood cx
   at OSH (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-23**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on Zosyn only, will switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.
   UTI is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - INR [**Last Name (LF) 548**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] treat with vitamin K 5mg IV x 1
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - hep serologies negative
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: resolved on reglan.
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Goals of Care: Family mtg today

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible VAP
   given increased sputum, although gram stain of sputum negative and
   culutre pending.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - wean vent today, trial of pressure support
   - Stop Zosyn, narrow coverage to  nafcillin to cover MSSA in blood cx
   at OSH (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-23**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on Zosyn only, will switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.
   UTI is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - INR [**Last Name (LF) 548**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] treat with vitamin K 5mg IV x 1
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - hep serologies negative
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: resolved on reglan.
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Goals of Care: Family mtg today

   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic, so will run even.   On pressors mostly due to sedatives.
   Concern for possible VAP given increased sputum, although gram stain of
   sputum negative and culutre pending.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - wean vent today, consider extubation when ready
   - cont Zosyn; may be able to narrow to nafcillin to cover MSSA in blood
   cx at OSH on [**11-21**] (day 1 treatment = [**11-23**])
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-23**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin only because of propofol, will
   aim to wean off pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool  with reglan on board.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family
[**12-2**] will work best for all
   family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will get back
   to us with convenient time in the afternoon for 1/109.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient's Condition:

* The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF.
* She is intubated and on pressors, with a vent placed back on AC mode.
* The patient has improving mental status, but is still sedated due to dysynchronous ventilation.
* She has been on CVVH for renal replacement therapy and is currently euvolemic.
* The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and ARF, and is at risk for further respiratory decline. Weaning off the vent and considering extubation when ready is a priority.
2. Shock: The patient is likely septic and has multiple possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis. Weaning off pressors and aiming to maintain a MAP > 65 and CVP 8-12 is important.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has ATN and is at risk for further renal decline. Continuing CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy is necessary.
4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving, but is still impaired due to toxic and metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH. Weaning off propofol and considering a head CT or neuro consult for prognosis is important.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, but is at risk for bleeding. Transfusing for HCT <21 and monitoring for evidence of bleeding is necessary.
6. Hepatitis: The patient has suspected alcoholic hepatitis, and further evaluation and management are needed.
7. Ileus/Abdominal Distension: The patient's ileus and abdominal distension have improved, but monitoring for abdominal compartment syndrome and considering a CT A/P and paracentesis PRN is important.
8. Portal Vein Thrombus: The patient has a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus, and anticoagulation may be considered in the future.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital (OSH) due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: ARDS, with improved secretions today, but appears less responsive to commands.
* Hypotension: Seemed to correspond to adding propofol, with a plan to change Zosyn to nafcillin to treat MSSA bacteremia.
* Renal failure: Continues on CVVH, currently even.
* Liver failure: Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with an increasing INR, requiring continued support and monitoring of LFTs/INR.
* Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy, with a plan to continue lactulose and rifaximin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Hypotension: Cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
3. Renal failure: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Liver failure: Increased risk of bleeding, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
5. Altered mental status: ICU delirium, coma, and increased risk of falls and pressure ulcers.
6. Bacteremia: Sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure.
7. Infectious complications: VAP, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.
8. Fluid overload: Pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was transferred from another hospital due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is currently in the ICU, intubated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/47 mmHg. She has a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient has several medical conditions, including ARDS, ARF, and liver failure due to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She is also experiencing hypotension, which is being managed with vasopressors. Her mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. She is also receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and is being monitored for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and ARF may lead to sepsis, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver failure may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
6. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and ARF may lead to further infections, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
7. Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor use may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's vasopressor therapy as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Continue to provide nutrition and glycemic control as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or nephrologist, to help manage the patient's ARDS and ARF.
7. Consider performing a tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
8. Consider performing a liver transplant if the patient's liver failure is severe and irreversible."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible PNA
   given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue nafcillin for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH
   (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on nafcillin for MSSA.  UTI is already treated by 7 day
   zosyn course.   Will need at least 2 week course of naf ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - INR rising, s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 1
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - hep serologies negative
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: resolved on reglan.
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue nafcillin for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH
   (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on nafcillin for MSSA.  UTI is already treated by 7 day
   zosyn course.   Will need at least 2 week course of naf ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible VAP
   given increased sputum, although gram stain of sputum negative and
   culutre pending.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - wean vent today, trial of pressure support
   - Stop Zosyn, narrow coverage to  nafcillin to cover MSSA in blood cx
   at OSH (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible VAP
   given increased sputum, although gram stain of sputum negative and
   culutre pending.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - wean vent today, trial of pressure support
   - Stop Zosyn, narrow coverage to  nafcillin to cover MSSA in blood cx
   at OSH (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-23**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on Zosyn only, will switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.
   UTI is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - INR [**Last Name (LF) 548**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] treat with vitamin K 5mg IV x 1
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - hep serologies negative
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: resolved on reglan.
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Goals of Care: Family mtg today

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressors and CVVH. Her condition has been improving, with increasing mental status and improving renal function.

However, the patient still faces several challenges:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, and there is a concern for possible VAP given increased sputum production.
2. Shock: The patient is likely septic, and there are multiple possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis.
3. Renal failure: The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria and is receiving CVVH. There is a concern for ATN in the setting of shock.
4. Hepatitis: The patient has suspected alcoholic hepatitis, and there is evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus.
5. Mental status: The patient's mental status is improving, but she is still at risk for delayed recovery due to toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Shock: Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, multi-organ failure, and death.
3. Renal failure: End-stage renal disease, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.
4. Hepatitis: Hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and bleeding.
5. Mental status: Delirium, agitation, and prolonged recovery.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Weaning from pressors and CVVH.
2. Switching to nafcillin for MSSA coverage.
3. Continuing CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy.
4. Monitoring mental status and weaning propofol.
5. Considering a head CT and neuro consult if mental status does not improve.
6. Transfusing for HCT <21 and monitoring for evidence of bleeding.
7. Starting Epogen for renal anemia.
8. Monitoring liver function and coagulation status.
9. Considering paracentesis for SBP if the patient develops fevers or clinical status worsens.

The patient's goals of care include improving her mental status, weaning from pressors and CVVH, and transitioning to hemodialysis as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - broaden to vanc/Ceftaz given spike last night through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Fever
 to 101 on [**2123-12-2**] while on CVVH, so temp was likely even
   higher
   - broaden coverage as above
   - panculture
   - diagnostic paracentesis
   - changes all lines, send tips for cultures
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continues on 2 pressors with levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean
   off pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and
   then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
    Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on raglan, continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - broaden to vanc/Ceftaz given spike last night through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Fever
 to 101 on [**2123-12-2**] while on CVVH, so temp was likely even
   higher
   - broaden coverage as above
   - panculture
   - diagnostic paracentesis
   - changes all lines, send tips for cultures
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continues on 2 pressors with levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean
   off pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and
   then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
    Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on raglan, continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Tolerating PSV for the moment. Requires
   substantial minute ventilation to account for metabolic acidosis
      -Discuss with renal if we can use CVVH to adjust metabolic acidosis
      -Continue to wean PSV as well.

      -Diagnostic paracentesis
      -Change CVC.
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.  INR continues to
   rise.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse who was transferred from another hospital due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for several complex medical conditions.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/44 mmHg (62/51 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 6 mmHg

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressin, propofol, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, and insulin. She is also receiving several IV medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and antihypertensives.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 15.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.5%
* Platelet count (Plt): 83 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 0.6 mg/dL
* Serum potassium (K): 0.9 mg/dL
* Serum sodium (Na): 133 mg/dL
* Serum chloride (Cl): 99 mEq/L
* Serum bicarbonate (HCO3): 21 mEq/L
* Serum glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* LDH: 276 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 1.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR): No new infiltrate

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: ARDS. The patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) for the moment, but requires substantial minute ventilation to account for metabolic acidosis. The plan is to discuss with the renal team about using CVVH to adjust metabolic acidosis and to continue weaning PSV.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is thought to be related to the addition of propofol, but a fever is also concerning for septic shock. The plan is to continue pressor support, investigate the cause of the fever, and maintain a CVP goal of 7-12 mmHg.
* Fever: The differential diagnosis includes ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related infection, and sepsis. The plan is to broaden antibiotics to vancomycin and ceftriaxone, obtain a pan culture, perform a diagnostic paracentesis, and change the central venous catheter (CVC).
* Renal failure: The patient is continuing to receive CVVH, with a goal of running the CVP at 8-12 mmHg.
* Liver failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and the INR is continuing to rise. The plan is to continue supporting the patient through this and monitor liver function tests (LFTs) and INR.
* Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. The plan is to continue lactulose and rifaximin.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension may be related to sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver failure may continue to progress, leading to further coagulopathy and bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may continue to progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
* Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may continue to worsen, leading to further cognitive impairment and decreased quality of life.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female who was transferred from another hospital with a history of ethanol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 6 mmHg

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Vasopressin: 2.4 units/hour
* Propofol: 10 mcg/kg/min
* Norepinephrine: 0.1 mcg/kg/min
* Calcium gluconate (CRRT): 1.4 grams/hour
* KCl (CRRT): 4 mEq/hour
* Insulin: Regular, 06:00 PM
* Famotidine (Pepcid): 04:30 AM
* Other medications: Peridex, colace, famotidine, lactulose, rifaximin, Reglan, albuterol/atropine, epogen

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 15.5 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.5%
* Platelet count: 83 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 21 mmol/L
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results: PT/PTT/INR: 26.5/64.9/2.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 28//, ALT/AST: 82/250, Alk Phos/T Bili: 98/24.1, Amylase/Lipase: /41, Differential-Neuts: 84.0%, Lymph: 13.3%, Mono: 1.7%, Eos: 0.7%, Fibrinogen: 499 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.5 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.1 g/dL, LDH: 276 IU/L, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 1.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* Chest X-ray: No new infiltrate

The patient's microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Respiratory failure: ARDS. Tolerating PSV for the moment. Requires substantial minute ventilation to account for metabolic acidosis. Discuss with renal if we can use CVVH to adjust metabolic acidosis. Continue to wean PSV as well.
* Hypotension: Seemed to correspond to adding propofol, but new fever is concerning for septic shock as well. Continue pressor support. Fever workup below. CVP goal 7-12.
* Fever: Difficult differential diagnosis, including VAP (less likely), catheter-related infection, and SBP. Broaden antibiotics to vancomycin and ceftazidime. Pan culture pending. Diagnostic paracentesis. Change CVC.
* Renal failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12.
* Liver failure: Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. INR continues to rise. Will continue to support through this and monitor LFTs/INR.
* Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. Better today. Continue lactulose and rifaximin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: ARDS can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Hypotension: Septic shock can lead to hypotension, which can be life-threatening.
* Fever: Fever can be a sign of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
* Renal failure: CVVH can lead to renal failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Liver failure: Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis can lead to liver failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Altered mental status: ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy can lead to altered mental status, which can be life-threatening.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill 45-year-old female who is requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care. The patient's conditions, including ARDS, septic shock, renal failure, liver failure, and altered mental status, require close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - wean vent as tolerated, try [**4-4**] today, with possible extubation
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above, dose vanc by level with daily
   troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continues on 2 pressors with levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean
   off pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and
   then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean sedation
   - consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 45-year-old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She is intubated and on pressors and CVVH due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient has multiple potential sources of sepsis, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis**: The patient has multiple potential sources of sepsis, including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. This increases the risk of sepsis-related complications, such as organ dysfunction, shock, and mortality.
2. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: The patient has ARF, which may progress to AKI if not managed properly. This increases the risk of chronic kidney disease, need for dialysis, and mortality.
3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy**: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and increased mortality.
4. **Coagulopathy**: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. **Pneumonia**: The patient has a history of ARDS, which increases the risk of pneumonia, especially with the presence of MSSA in the sputum.
6. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding**: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the presence of portal vein thrombus.
7. **Catheter-Related Complications**: The patient has multiple catheters in place, which increases the risk of catheter-related complications, such as sepsis, bleeding, and mechanical complications.
8. **Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)**: The patient is intubated and at risk for VAP, especially with the presence of MSSA in the sputum.
9. **Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) Complications**: The patient is on CVVH and may require RRT, which increases the risk of complications, such as bleeding, electrolyte imbalances, and infection.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Consider early consultation with liver and nephrology specialists to optimize management.
3. Continue to treat sepsis aggressively with broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control measures.
4. Monitor for signs of AKI and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Consider early consideration of liver transplantation in patients with severe liver disease.
6. Monitor for signs of coagulopathy and bleeding complications and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Consider early consideration of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, especially with the presence of MSSA in the sputum.
8. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Consider early consideration of anticoagulation therapy for portal vein thrombus."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Requiring minimal vent support today.
   Secretions minimal
     -SBT now.  If [**Last Name (LF) 4767**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] extubate.
    Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding propofol but new fever
   also concerning for septic shock as well
      -Wean as able when we stop propofol
      -Fever w/u below
      -CVP goal [**7-12**]
      -consider checking adrenal access if remains hypotensive
   Fever: Diff Dx include VAP (less likely), catheter related infection,
   SBP.  Fever curve improved now.  Lines changed.
     -Continue broad abx (vanc, cefep) for now.  Dose vanc by level.
     -F/u cultures
     -Change a-line
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
   Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.
      -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Requiring minimal vent support today.
   Secretions minimal
     -SBT now.  If [**Last Name (LF) 4767**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] extubate.
    Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding propofol but new fever
   also concerning for septic shock as well
      -Wean as able when we stop propofol
      -Fever w/u below
      -CVP goal [**7-12**]
      -consider checking adrenal access if remains hypotensive
   Fever: Diff Dx include VAP (less likely), catheter related infection,
   SBP.  Fever curve improved now.  Lines changed.
     -Continue broad abx (vanc, cefep) for now.  Dose vanc by level.
     -F/u cultures
     -Change a-line
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
   Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with a history of ethanol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is receiving minimal ventilator support and is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) during the day.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 105/48 mmHg, and is receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions.
* Renal: The patient is continuing on CVVH, with a goal of running the circuit at a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-12 mmHg.
* Liver: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and is receiving lactulose and rifaximin to support liver function.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to worsening respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen, leading to further deterioration in renal function.
* Liver failure: The patient's alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis may progress, leading to further liver dysfunction and potential liver failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of neurological complications such as seizures or stroke.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan should include:

* Close monitoring of respiratory status, with consideration for increasing ventilator support as needed.
* Aggressive management of sepsis, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control measures.
* Close monitoring of renal function, with consideration for adjusting CVVH settings as needed.
* Close monitoring of liver function, with consideration for adjusting lactulose and rifaximin dosing as needed.
* Close monitoring of neurological status, with consideration for adjusting sedation and analgesia as needed to prevent further neurological complications.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Requiring minimal vent support today.
   Secretions minimal
     -SBT now.  If [**Last Name (LF) 4767**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] extubate.
    Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding propofol but new fever
   also concerning for septic shock as well
      -Wean as able when we stop propofol
      -Fever w/u below
      -CVP goal [**7-12**]
   Fever: Diff Dx include VAP (less likely), catheter related infection,
   SBP.  Fever curve improved now.  Lines changed.
     -Continue broad abx (vanc, cefep) for now.  Dose vanc by level.
     -F/u cultures
     -Change a-line
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
   Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.
      -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

   Microbiology: No growth of blood, sputum, or urine at [**Hospital1 19**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon weaned off, will aim to to
   maintain MAP > 60, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - ask renal they would consider CVVH now that pt off pressors and trial
   of HD
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, extubated, but still altered, making
   inappropriate requests.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Elevated T.bili, D. bili . In the
   setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse 1 unit today for for HCT  of 21, monitor for evidence of
   bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stop reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon weaned off, will aim to to
   maintain MAP > 60, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - ask renal they would consider CVVH now that pt off pressors and trial
   of HD
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, extubated, but still altered, making
   inappropriate requests.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Elevated T.bili, D. bili . In the
   setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse 1 unit today for for HCT  of 21, monitor for evidence of
   bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stop reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol (EtOH) hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and on pressors and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient was extubated without complication and is now on vasopressin. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential sources of sepsis, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, is crucial.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is likely to be complicated by the presence of sepsis, which can worsen respiratory function.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely to be complicated by the presence of ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver failure can lead to coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. GI Bleeding: The patient's liver failure can lead to GI bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
7. Sepsis-Induced Cardiomyopathy: The patient's sepsis can lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, which can worsen cardiac function.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
9. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): The patient's CVVH and dialysis catheter can increase the risk of developing CRBSI.
10. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's sepsis can lead to infection-related complications, such as abscesses, empyemas, and septic shock.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for MSSA and E. coli.
2. Monitor for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
3. Continue CVVH until the patient is able to tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy.
4. Monitor for signs of ARDS, such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
5. Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Monitor for signs of coagulopathy, such as bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymoses.
7. Monitor for signs of GI bleeding, such as melena, hematemesis, and abdominal pain.
8. Consider sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and monitor for signs of cardiac dysfunction.
9. Monitor for signs of pneumonia, such as fever, cough, and chest pain.
10. Monitor for signs of CRBSI, such as fever, chills, and bacteremia.
11. Consider infection-related complications, such as abscesses, empyemas, and septic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon still on, will aim to wean off
   pressor  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She was extubated yesterday and weaned off pressors today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/52 mmHg. Her respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 99% and a PEEP of 0 cmH2O.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment. Further monitoring and discussion with the renal team is necessary to determine the timing of transitioning to hemodialysis (HD).
2. **Liver Failure:** The patient has a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and INR is essential to support liver function and prevent further deterioration.
3. **Infection:** The patient has a history of fever, which could be related to a variety of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related infection, or sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and follow-up cultures are necessary to determine the causative organism.
4. **Anemia:** The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.5 g/dL, indicating anemia. Transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) was ordered, and further monitoring is necessary to determine the need for additional transfusions.
5. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient has a history of altered mental status, which could be related to ICU delirium, hepatic encephalopathy, or other factors. Reglan was stopped, and lactulose and rifaximin are being continued to support liver function and prevent further deterioration.
6. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient has a history of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Monitoring of respiratory function and support is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
7. **Fever:** The patient's fever has resolved, but further monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and prevent recurrence.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her clinical status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon weaned off, will aim to to
   maintain MAP > 60, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - ask renal they would consider CVVH now that pt off pressors and trial
   of HD
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, extubated, but still altered, making
   inappropriate requests.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Elevated T.bili, D. bili . In the
   setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse 1 unit today for for HCT  of 21, monitor for evidence of
   bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stop reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She is intubated on pressors and CVVH for shock, ARDS, and ARF.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 38°C (100.4°F)
* HR: 119 bpm
* BP: 100/46 mmHg
* RR: 18 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.0-12.5 K/uL
* Hct: 21.0-22.3%
* Plt: 90-112 K/uL
* Cr: 1.2-1.5 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22-24 mmHg
* Glucose: 89-133 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 22.4/57.2/2.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 28//, ALT/AST: 67/236, Alk Phos/T Bili: 87/24.7, Amylase/Lipase: /41, Differential-Neuts: 84.0%, Lymph: 13.3%, Mono: 1.7%, Eos: 0.7%, Fibrinogen: 499 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 1.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.1 g/dL, LDH: 260 IU/L, Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime for sepsis, and is being monitored for potential complications. The patient's mental status is improving, but she is still altered and making inappropriate requests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying liver disease and the presence of MSSA in her sputum.
2. ARDS: The patient is already intubated on pressors and CVVH for ARDS, and is at risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient has ATN and is at risk for further renal deterioration.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has elevated T.bili and D.bili, and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Portal vein thrombus: The patient has a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus, which may require anticoagulation therapy.
6. Ileus/Abdominal distension: The patient has had ileus and abdominal distension in the past, and is at risk for further gastrointestinal complications.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require transfusions.
8. Infections: The patient is at risk for further infections, particularly with MSSA and E coli.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early on and to adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors.
   [**Male First Name (un) **] successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade spike yesterday
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level with
   daily troughs
 f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60,
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until tomorrow, [**2123-12-7**] (currently
   broadened to vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Didn
t bump approp to 1 unit on
   [**2122-12-4**], likely hemolyzed given liver disease. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: resolved. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. There was
   also concern for possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to the ICU due to shock, ARDS, and ARF, and has been intubated on pressors. She remains hypotensive with one pressor requirement and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient has had a fever curve trending downward, but with a low-grade spike yesterday. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, and continues to receive these medications. Her blood cultures have been negative to date, and she has also been tested for C. difficile, which has been negative.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she has been extubated. However, she remains on oxygen therapy and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 251. Her renal function is compromised, with anuria/oliguria, and she is receiving CVVH until she can tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy.

The patient's mental status is altered, and she is still receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. She has anemia, which is being treated with epogen, and her liver function tests are stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock, and her blood cultures have been negative to date. She continues to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her condition requires close monitoring for signs of sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she is receiving CVVH. She requires close monitoring for signs of worsening renal function, and her treatment plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. She requires close monitoring for signs of worsening encephalopathy, and her treatment plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for bleeding. She requires close monitoring for signs of bleeding, and her treatment plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of septic shock and is at risk for infection. She requires close monitoring for signs of infection, and her treatment plan may need to be adjusted accordingly.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors.
   [**Male First Name (un) **] successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade spike yesterday
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level with
   daily troughs
 f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60,
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until tomorrow, [**2123-12-7**] (currently
   broadened to vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Didn
t bump approp to 1 unit on
   [**2122-12-4**], likely hemolyzed given liver disease. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: resolved. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. There was
   also concern for possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 45-year-old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status.
* She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a requirement for pressors to maintain blood pressure.
* She has a history of septic shock, ARDS, and ARF, and is currently on CVVH for renal support.
* She has a low-grade fever, which has trended downward, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime).
* She has a history of anemia, and is receiving epoetin alfa for renal anemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's septic shock is likely related to multiple sources, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and treatment is focused on addressing these potential sources of sepsis.
2. **Renal Failure:** The patient's renal failure is likely related to ATN, and is being treated with CVVH. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and her urine output is decreased.
3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. She is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.
4. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is likely related to her liver disease, and is being treated with epoetin alfa.
5. **Infection:** The patient has a history of infections, including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. She is at risk for further infections, particularly given her immunocompromised state.
6. **ARDS:** The patient has a history of ARDS, which is being treated with mechanical ventilation and pressors.
7. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension is likely related to her septic shock and is being treated with pressors.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and treatment is focused on addressing her septic shock, renal failure, and other medical complications.
* The patient's antibiotics will be continued, and her cultures will be followed up.
* The patient's CVVH will be continued until she is able to tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy.
* The patient's mental status will be closely monitored, and she will be followed up with a neurology consult if her condition does not improve.
* The patient's liver function will be closely monitored, and she will be followed up with a liver consult if necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She has been febrile, with a temperature of 101.4°F, and has required pressors to maintain blood pressure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, with an FiO2 of 30% and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 251. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 99/42 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and liver dysfunction, with an INR of 2.1 and a total bilirubin of 24.7 mg/dL. She has been treated with antibiotics, including nafcillin, vancomycin, and cefepime, and has received lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may indicate sepsis, which can progress to septic shock and organ failure.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for increased oxygen support.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver dysfunction may progress, leading to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's anuria may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
5. Infection: The patient's catheter-related infections may worsen, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, self-extubation, and mortality.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility may lead to pressure ulcers, which can become infected and worsen her overall condition.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to the need for increased oxygen support and mechanical ventilation.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest and death.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from the emergency department due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is currently febrile, with a temperature of 101.4°F, and has a history of sepsis. She is receiving pressors to maintain blood pressure and has a central venous catheter (CVC) and femoral line. She is also receiving antibiotics, including nafcillin, vancomycin, and cefepime, and has a urinary catheter.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.4°F
* Heart rate: 117 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 99/42 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Central venous pressure: 7 mmHg

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Icteric sclera
* Normocephalic
* Tachycardic
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Distended abdomen
* Hypoactive bowel sounds
* Absent peripheral pulses
* Jaundiced skin
* Follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is not oriented

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 10.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 90 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL
* Bilirubin: 21 mg/dL
* Alanine aminotransferase: 67 U/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase: 236 U/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 87 U/L
* Gamma-glutamyl transferase: 24.7 U/L
* Amylase: 41 U/L
* Lipase: 41 U/L
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 260 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray are consistent with ARDS.
3. Liver failure: The patient's elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes suggest liver failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine suggest renal failure.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and requirement for pressors suggest cardiovascular instability.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and hypoactive bowel sounds suggest the possibility of neurological complications.
7. Infection: The patient's febrile response and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection.
8. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to treat potential sepsis.
3. Continue to support the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular function as needed.
4. Consider consulting a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or a nephrologist, to assist with the patient's care.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider consulting a neurologist if necessary.
6. Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to the patient's regimen to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
7. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and consider consulting a hematologist if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade yesterday after 101.5
   on AM rounds [**2123-12-6**].  WBC increasing.  Other sources considered SBP
   (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]), sinusitis (no evidence sinus secretion).
   Concern for line infection: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**]
   (not yet replaced), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].
   Also consider abdominal source, esp with OSH CT scan showing pancolitis
   and ? peri-hepatic fluid collection
   - Abd CT (w/contrast if OK with renal), also will scan sinus and lungs
   - Renal will place new HD line and pull old one
   - changed cefepime to zosyn [**2123-12-6**], dose vanc by level with daily
   troughs
 f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures - ngtd
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**])
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs
   tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Now stable. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative

   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: extubated. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Had PNA
   at OSH with MSSA in sputum,
   - continue broad coverage vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**])--> changed to
   vanco/zosyn on [**2123-12-6**] for persistent fever
   - dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and required pressors, but was successfully extubated. She remains hypotensive and requires one pressor. She has ongoing fever, sepsis, and renal failure, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a history of MSSA bacteremia and E coli UTI, and has undergone multiple line changes. She is on CVVH and has a femoral HD line that needs to be replaced.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fever and sepsis make it a high-risk complication.
2. Line Infection: The multiple line changes and ongoing fever increase the risk of line infection.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing renal failure and anuria/oliguria increase the risk of further complications, such as ATN.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure and cirrhosis increase the risk of further complications, such as worsening encephalopathy and portal hypertension.
5. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal distension and ileus increase the risk of further complications, such as perforation or abscess.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure and ARDS increase the risk of further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and ongoing encephalopathy increase the risk of further neurological complications, such as seizures or brain edema.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for MSSA and E coli.
2. Replace the femoral HD line with a tunnelled HD line.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Consider a head CT or neuro consult to evaluate the patient's mental status and prognosis.
6. Continue CVVH until the patient is able to tolerate another method of renal replacement.
7. Consider a paracentesis to evaluate for SBP.
8. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as needed to maintain a MAP > 60.
9. Continue to cover for MSSA in the sputum and blood.
10. Consider a TTE or TEE to evaluate for cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade yesterday after 101.5
   on AM rounds [**2123-12-6**]
   - changed cefepime to zosyn, dose vanc by level with daily troughs
   f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures - ngtd
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**])
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line not working appropriately, needs to be replaced by
   renal; eventually needs tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Didn
t bump approp to 1 unit on
   [**2122-12-4**], likely hemolyzed given liver disease. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: extubated. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. There
   was also concern for possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue broad coverage vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**])--> changed to
   vanco/zosyn on [**2123-12-6**] for persistent fever
   - dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade yesterday after 101.5
   on AM rounds [**2123-12-6**]
   - changed cefepime to zosyn, dose vanc by level with daily troughs
   f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures - ngtd
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**])
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line not working appropriately, needs to be replaced by
   renal; eventually needs tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Didn
t bump approp to 1 unit on
   [**2122-12-4**], likely hemolyzed given liver disease. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: extubated. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. There
   was also concern for possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue broad coverage vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**])--> changed to
   vanco/zosyn on [**2123-12-6**] for persistent fever
   - dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been extubated and remains on CVVH.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.4°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (84-119 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/49 mmHg (62-121/59-70 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (15-32 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 12.5-18.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7-9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 112-143 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5-2.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23-24 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: 136-137 mg/dL (sodium), 2.1-3.0 mEq/L (potassium), 104-137 mEq/L (chloride)

* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 260 IU/L
* Calcium: 10.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are:

* Liver US: Nodular appearance of the liver surface, consistent with cirrhosis. Ascites. Gallbladder sludge with no sonographic evidence of cholecystitis.
* CXR: No significant abnormalities.

The patient's medical conditions are:

* EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
* Acute hepatic failure
* Shock
* ARDS
* ARF
* Renal failure
* Sepsis
* Hypotension
* Respiratory failure

The patient's potential medical complications are:

* Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying liver disease, cirrhosis, and the presence of multiple potential sources of infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is at risk of developing further renal failure.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and cirrhosis increase her risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.
* GI bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and portal hypertension increase her risk of developing GI bleeding.
* DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and the presence of multiple central lines.
* PNA: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of MSSA in her sputum increase her risk of developing PNA.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* CVVH
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn)
* Pressors (levophed)
* Renal assistance (femoral HD line)
* Lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Epogen for anemia
* Reglan for ileus
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) for MSSA bacteremia
* Consideration of head CT and neuro consult for prognosis if mental status does not improve.

   used.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
   Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up cultures and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with diagnoses of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is currently receiving pressor support, CVVH, and antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still requiring small amounts of levophed to maintain blood pressure. Her respiratory status is improving, and she has been extubated. However, she is still anuric and has liver and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and WBC trending up may indicate the development of sepsis. Further evaluation of cultures and antibiotics is necessary to prevent and treat this complication.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and she is at risk for further liver damage. Close monitoring of LFTs and INR is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's anuria is a concern, and CVVH is being continued to support her renal function. However, the risk of complications from CVVH, such as bleeding and infection, should be closely monitored.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is improving, but she is still at risk for further respiratory complications. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and consideration of non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation if necessary.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension may be related to her new fever or cirrhosis, and close monitoring of her blood pressure and cardiac function is necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status may be multifactorial, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of her neurological status and consideration of medications to prevent delirium and treat encephalopathy is necessary.
7. Infection: The patient's NGTD on sputum and ascites cultures may indicate the development of infection. Further evaluation and treatment of infection is necessary to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, and adjust therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to support the patient's respiratory status with non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation if necessary.
3. Continue CVVH and monitor the patient's renal function closely.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further liver damage.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's neurological status and consider medications to prevent delirium and treat encephalopathy.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's infection status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
   Fever: Fever curve down today but also on CVVH.  WBC trending up.
     -Check Vanc level today
     -Cont Vanco/Zosyn
     -Resite CVVH catheter
     -F/u cultures
     -Abd/Chest/sinus CT. Discuss with renal if IV contrast can/should be
   used.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.
     -Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
   Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up cultures and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with diagnoses of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is currently requiring small amounts of levophed and has a history of aneurysmal rupture. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/55 mmHg. She has a SpO2 of 97% and is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Her neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver failure, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, as well as coagulopathy. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 28 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.

The patient's medical history is significant for ethanol abuse, and she has a history of aneurysmal rupture. She is currently receiving treatment for ARDS and ARF, and is being monitored for signs of sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to rule out sepsis and prevent its progression.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is still at risk for developing ARDS due to her underlying liver disease and the use of pressors.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is at risk for developing further renal failure if her blood pressure is not controlled and her fluid status is not optimized.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is at risk for developing further liver failure if her underlying liver disease is not managed effectively.
5. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and liver disease make her at risk for bleeding, especially if she undergoes invasive procedures or is given anticoagulant therapy.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her underlying liver disease and the use of diuretics. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to determine the cause of her anemia and to manage it effectively.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is likely compromised due to her underlying liver disease and the use of diuretics. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to determine the cause of her malnutrition and to manage it effectively.
8. ICU Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to her underlying liver disease, the use of pressors, and the ICU environment. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to determine the cause of her delirium and to manage it effectively.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions. Further evaluation and treatment are needed to determine the cause of her altered mental status and to manage her delirium effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # GI bleeding
 clots in stool.  Hct drifted down
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - transfuse 2 units FFP
   - repeat Hct @ noon; transfuse 1 more unit if not > 25
   - monitor
   # Fever
 Pt relatively hypothermic now, on bear-hugger.  CT showed
   concern for dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis.  Flagyl
   added to vanco/zosyn to cover cdiff and dental source.  Repeat Cdiff
   tox ordered.  Other sources considered SBP (neg diagnostic para
   [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced
   [**12-7**]), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].  Attempt for
   changing dialysis line unsuccessful [**2123-12-7**].
   - dental c/s, pt cannot have panorex due to clinical instability;
   Dentist to see [**2123-12-9**]
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl -- vanco dose by level
   - f/u cultures, cdiff
   - Renal will re-attempt to place new HD line and pull old one
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known infections include MSSA bacteremia (OSH
   culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  Lines have been changed
   except for HD catheter.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/

   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs
   tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Has menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 25 (1 unit this AM, repeat Hct and transfuse
   again up to 25).
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].

   - repeat RUQ u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure slowly worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # GI bleeding
 clots in stool.  Hct drifted down
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - transfuse 2 units FFP
   - repeat Hct @ noon; transfuse 1 more unit if not > 25
   - monitor
   # Fever
 Pt relatively hypothermic now, on bear-hugger.  CT showed
   concern for dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis.  Flagyl
   added to vanco/zosyn to cover cdiff and dental source.  Repeat Cdiff
   tox ordered.  Other sources considered SBP (neg diagnostic para
   [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced
   [**12-7**]), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].  Attempt for
   changing dialysis line unsuccessful [**2123-12-7**].
   - dental c/s, pt cannot have panorex due to clinical instability;
   Dentist to see [**2123-12-9**]
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl -- vanco dose by level
   - f/u cultures, cdiff
   - Renal will re-attempt to place new HD line and pull old one
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known infections include MSSA bacteremia (OSH
   culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  Lines have been changed
   except for HD catheter.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* Patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD, etoh hepatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure.
* She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15.
* She has a history of MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* She has ascites, pleural effusion, and is on continuous dialysis.
* She has a history of pancreatitis and is currently on pancreatic enzymes.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may indicate sepsis. The patient's temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), which is within normal limits.
2. **Renal Failure:** The patient has acute renal failure and is on continuous dialysis. The patient's creatinine level is 2.4 mg/dL, which is elevated.
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, which is within normal limits.
4. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient has ascites, pancreatitis, and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient has ESLD and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is altered, but the patient is extubated and following simple commands.
6. **Dental Complications:** The patient has a history of dental abscesses and is currently on antibiotics. The patient's dental status is unclear.
7. **Infections:** The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI, and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but the patient's urine culture is pending.
8. **Coagulopathy:** The patient has a history of coagulopathy and is at risk for bleeding. The patient's platelet count is 143,000/μL, which is within normal limits.
9. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient has a history of electrolyte imbalance and is at risk for further imbalance. The patient's sodium level is 138 mmol/L, which is within normal limits.
10. **Hypovolemia:** The patient has a history of hypovolemia and is at risk for further hypovolemia. The patient's blood pressure is 101/54 mmHg, which is within normal limits.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust dialysis as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust mechanical ventilation as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's hepatic encephalopathy and adjust lactulose and rifaximin as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's dental status and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's infections and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust platelet transfusions as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalance and adjust electrolyte supplementation as necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's hypovolemia and adjust fluid resuscitation as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 Pt relatively hypothermic now, on bear-hugger.  CT showed
   concern for dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis.  Flagyl
   added to vanco/zosyn to cover cdiff and dental source.  Repeat Cdiff
   tox ordered.  Other sources considered SBP (neg diagnostic para
   [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced
   [**12-7**]), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].  Attempt for
   changing dialysis line unsuccessful.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl -- vanco dose by level
   - f/u cultures, cdiff
   - Renal will re-attempt to place new HD line and pull old one; can
   consider tunnelled line now that pt afebrile
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known infections include MSSA bacteremia (OSH
   culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  Lines have been changed
   except for HD catheter.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs
   tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Has menses, Hct drifting down.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat RUQ u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising
 may indicate that her liver failure slowly worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: extubated. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Had PNA
   at OSH with MSSA in sputum,
   - continue broad coverage vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**])--> changed to
   vanco/zosyn on [**2123-12-6**] for persistent fever
   - dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   - have to run CVVH even given hypotension

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD, EtOH hepatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure and altered mental status, and was later transferred to another hospital for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.1°C (98.7°F), HR 107 bpm, BP 101/54 mmHg, RR 28 breaths/min, SpO2 100%
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula with O2 delivery
* Cardiovascular: Hypotensive with a requirement for norepinephrine pressor
* Renal: Anuric with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL
* Hepatic: ESLD with evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus
* Neurological: Altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and distended with a large stool output
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC count: 18.3 x 10^9/L
	+ Hct: 20.9%
	+ Platelet count: 143 x 10^9/L
	+ Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mg/dL
	+ Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 72 IU/L
	+ Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 218 IU/L
	+ Bilirubin: 31.0 mg/dL
	+ Alkaline phosphatase: 107 IU/L
	+ Amylase: 41 IU/L
	+ Lipase: 0 IU/L

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI, as well as the presence of a dental abscess, there is a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's anuric state and elevated creatinine level indicate ongoing renal failure, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ESLD and portal vein thrombus may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen her altered mental status.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and requirement for pressor support may indicate ongoing cardiovascular instability, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract and her ongoing abdominal distension may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Infection: The patient's ongoing fever and positive blood cultures may indicate ongoing infection, which can worsen her condition if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for MSSA and E. coli, as well as coverage for dental abscess.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust pressor support as needed.
3. Continue CVVH to manage renal failure and maintain electrolyte balance.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging studies to rule out other causes of altered mental status.
5. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with nasal cannula and O2 delivery.
6. Monitor the patient's abdominal distension and consider further imaging studies to rule out other causes of abdominal pain.
7. Consider further management of the patient's ESLD, including liver transplantation if necessary.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care as necessary to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

     -Empiric flagyl given colitis on CT
     -Renal to attempt to resite CVVH catheter again today
     -F/u cultures including stool cultures
     -Dental consult regarding possible abscess.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.
     -Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
    Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up fever work up and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Bili's still
   increasing without clear evidence of obstruction on CT.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin
    Anemia:  HCT down this AM, some small clots in stool today.
     -Serial HCTs, transfuse to keep HCT >25.
     -FFP 2 units today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse who was transferred from another hospital with a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is currently extubated and being treated in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Fever: The patient's fever curve has decreased, and she is requiring a Bair hugger while on CVVH.
* WBC count: The patient's WBC count has decreased.
* Respiratory status: The patient has ARDS and is now extubated, but is still requiring oxygen therapy.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypotension and is requiring pressor support.
* Renal status: The patient is anuric and is still requiring CVVH.
* Liver status: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and her bilirubin levels are increasing without evidence of obstruction on CT.
* Neurological status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.
* Hematological status: The patient has anemia, and her HCT level has decreased.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing to support her through her liver failure and monitoring her LFTs and INR.
* Resiting the CVVH catheter and running even.
* Continuing lactulose and rifaximin to support her altered mental status.
* Transfusing blood products to keep her HCT level above 25.
* Monitoring her for signs of sepsis and adjusting her antibiotic therapy as needed.
* Continuing to provide respiratory support and monitoring her for signs of respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever and WBC count have decreased, but she is still at risk for developing sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS and is still requiring oxygen therapy, which puts her at risk for developing respiratory failure.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is worsening, which puts her at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy.
* Renal failure: The patient is anuric and is still requiring CVVH, which puts her at risk for developing acute kidney injury.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which puts her at risk for bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is at risk for developing infections, particularly in her respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.  Now
   extubated.
    Fever: Fever curve down, in fact, requiring bair-hugger while on CVVH.
    WBC down today.
     -Check Vanc level today
     -Cont Vanco/Zosyn
     -Empiric flagyl given colitis on CT
     -Renal to attempt to resite CVVH catheter again today
     -F/u cultures including stool cultures
     -Dental consult regarding possible abscess.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.
     -Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
    Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up fever work up and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Bili's still
   increasing without clear evidence of obstruction on CT.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin
    Anemia:  HCT down this AM, some small clots in stool today.
     -Serial HCTs, transfuse to keep HCT >25.
     -FFP 2 units today.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse who was transferred to the ICU from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is now extubated and has been febrile with a temperature of 37.1°C. Her WBC count has decreased today. She has a history of cirrhosis and is anuric, requiring CVVH. Her liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a high INR. She is also experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. She has a history of anemia and has had small clots in her stool today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and WBC count may indicate sepsis, which could worsen her condition and lead to organ failure.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may progress and lead to respiratory failure, which could be fatal.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a high INR, which could lead to liver failure and death.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and high creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which could worsen her condition and lead to electrolyte imbalances.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anemia and small clots in her stool may indicate a bleeding diathesis, which could worsen her condition and lead to life-threatening bleeding.
6. ICU Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to ICU delirium, which could worsen her condition and lead to long-term cognitive impairment.
7. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she has a high INR, which could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a life-threatening condition.
8. Infection: The patient's febrile response and abnormal lab results may indicate an infection, which could worsen her condition and lead to organ failure.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and small clots in her stool may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen her condition and lead to life-threatening bleeding.

Based on this information, it is crucial to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s to see today, unable to get panorex due to clinical
   instability
   - would taper down to only flagyl to cover both dental and c diff
   - f/u cultures, send 3^rd cdiff, but would treat with empiric 14 day
   course of flagyl
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**]. Sinusists: neg CT.
   Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known prior infections include MSSA bacteremia
   (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  - continue levophed, wean as
   tolerated will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI, but was
   broadened when re-spiked, now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]. Would taper as above
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - per renal, if afebrile today, try to place tunneled HD line, can then
   d/c femoral CVVH line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Has menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   24h events:
   - renal wanted to see if she remained afebrile; if so then would like
   IR guided tunnelled line, so did not change CVVH line
   - Hct did not bump to 1 unit -- ordered for 2 add'l PRBCs - repeat Hct
   24.8
   - Received 2 units FFP
   - Spoke to sister who will try to mobilize family for family meeting
   - stool O&P negative, culture pending
   - A-line came out; was re-sited on the left arm, ABP higher than NIBP,
   so pressor requirement halved

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s to see today, unable to get panorex due to clinical
   instability
   - would taper down to only flagyl to cover both dental and c diff
   - f/u cultures, send 3^rd cdiff, but would treat with empiric 14 day
   course of flagyl
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),

   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known prior infections include MSSA bacteremia
   (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  - continue levophed, wean as
   tolerated will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI, but was
   broadened when re-spiked, now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]. Would taper as above
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - per renal, if afebrile today, try to place tunneled HD line, can then
   d/c femoral CVVH line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Has menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been extubated and is currently on CVVH due to renal failure. She has a history of septic shock, ARDS, and ARF, and has had multiple positive blood cultures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.2°C, HR 99 bpm, BP 105/50 mmHg, RR 24 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 6 mmHg, ABP higher than NIBP, pressor requirement halved
* Fluid balance: Total in 10,591 mL, total out 11,144 mL, balance -553 mL
* Respiratory support: SpO2 100%, ABG 7.44/36/143/24/1
* Physical examination: NAD, A+ x 2, icteric, 3/6 systolic murmur, decreased breath sounds R>L bases, obese soft nt/ slightly disrtended hypoactive BS, trace b/l peripheral edema, mild asterixis
* Labs: Hct 24.8, WBC 16.2, platelet count 69, Cr 1.5, TCO2 26, glucose 123, other labs as noted
* Imaging: CT showed concern for dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis
* Microbiology: Cdiff negative, stool cx negative, yeast in sputum
* Assessment and plan: The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted. She has ongoing pancolitis, septic shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is on CVVH and pressors, and is at risk for GI bleeding and further complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* GI bleeding: The patient has had clots in her stool and her Hct has not bumped appropriately. She is at risk for further bleeding and may require transfusion.
* Shock: The patient has septic shock and is at risk for further decompensation. She is on pressors and will need to be weaned gradually.
* Renal failure: The patient has ATN and is on CVVH. She may require further renal replacement therapy and will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening renal function.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis and is at risk for worsening encephalopathy. She is on lactulose and rifaximin, but will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening mental status.
* Infection: The patient has had multiple positive blood cultures and is at risk for further infection. She will need to be closely monitored for signs of sepsis and will require further antimicrobial therapy as needed.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT and PTT, and is at risk for bleeding. She will need to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding and will require further coagulation studies as needed.
* Fluid overload: The patient has a significant fluid imbalance and is at risk for fluid overload. She will need to be closely monitored for signs of fluid overload and will require further fluid management as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and will require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was transferred from another hospital with severe alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is currently extubated and being managed in the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: ARDS, now extubated and doing well, with aspiration precautions.
* Cardiovascular status: Hypotension, still requiring pressor support, possibly related to new fever and cirrhosis.
* Renal status: Anuric, with ongoing CVVH support.
* Liver status: Alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with increasing bilirubin levels despite lack of evidence of obstruction on CT.
* Neurological status: Altered mental status, likely multifactorial, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.
* Hematological status: Anemia, with HCT decreasing, and small clots in stool.
* Infection status: Fever curve improving, with empiric flagyl given for colitis on CT, and pending stool cultures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's history of sepsis and ongoing infection, there is a risk of sepsis recurrence or progression.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and small clots in stool increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if the patient's HCT level continues to decrease.
* Liver failure: The patient's ongoing liver failure and increasing bilirubin levels may lead to worsening encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's anuric state and ongoing CVVH support may lead to worsening renal failure and electrolyte imbalances.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure and ARDS may lead to worsening respiratory status and potential need for re-intubation.
* Infectious complications: The patient's ongoing infection and pending stool cultures may lead to the development of new infectious complications, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan of care should focus on:

* Continuing to manage the patient's sepsis and infection with antibiotics and supportive care.
* Monitoring the patient's HCT level and transfusing as necessary to maintain a level above 25.
* Weaning the patient's pressor support and monitoring for signs of hypotension.
* Continuing CVVH support and monitoring the patient's renal function.
* Managing the patient's liver failure with supportive care and consulting with liver specialists.
* Monitoring the patient's neurological status and adjusting lactulose and rifaximin as necessary.
* Providing respiratory support and monitoring for signs of respiratory failure.
* Monitoring the patient's infectious status and adjusting antibiotics as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, transferred to the ICU from the emergency department with symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). She was previously extubated.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg

The patient has a fever curve that has decreased, but she still requires bair-hugger therapy while on CVVH. Her white blood cell count (WBC) is stable, and her hemoglobin (HCT) is declining.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Anemia: The patient's HCT is decreasing, and she has small clots in her stool. Serial HCTs will be monitored, and transfusions will be given to keep the HCT above 25.
2. Hypotension: The patient still requires pressor support, which may be related to her new fever or cirrhosis.
3. Renal failure: The patient remains anuric, and her creatinine (Cr) level is 1.5 mg/dL.
4. Liver failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with increasing bilirubin levels without evidence of obstruction on CT scan.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, and she is now extubated and doing well.
7. Potential infections: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and has pending stool and sputum cultures.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Monitoring of her fever curve and adjusting antibiotics as necessary.
2. Serial HCTs and transfusions to maintain a HCT above 25.
3. Weaning of pressors as able.
4. Resite of CVVH catheter as necessary.
5. Support for liver failure through lactulose and rifaximin.
6. Continue lactulose and rifaximin for altered mental status.
7. Aspiration precautions due to ARDS.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: Fiber repletion and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
2. Lines: Dialysis catheter, multi-lumen catheter, and arterial line.
3. Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker, and VAP prophylaxis.
4. Code status: Full code.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch-tall individual with a weight classified as overweight/obese, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of EtOH hepatitis and renal failure.

The patient has been weaned off pressors and is currently off them. They have been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and remain afebrile. The bilirubin level is largely direct, but the haptoglobin is less than 20, which can be seen in end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or following transfusions.

The patient has a history of poor dentition and has been referred to dental services for a panorex. The liver prognosis is dismal, and the patient has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (bpm). The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and their heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 69 x 10^9/L. Their liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 248 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 73 IU/L. The patient's creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, and their potassium level is 4.2 mEq/L.

The patient has a high risk of developing medical complications, including:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is severely impaired, increasing the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and even coma.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. This increases the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
3. Infections: The patient has been on antibiotics, and their white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response. This increases the risk of developing infections, including sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulation therapy.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's weight is classified as overweight/obese, but their albumin level is low, indicating malnutrition. This increases the risk of developing malnutrition-related complications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver function is impaired, increasing the risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with anticoagulation therapy.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of complications, and their medical treatment should be tailored to address their specific needs. This may include adjusting their antibiotic regimen, managing their electrolyte imbalances, and providing nutritional support to prevent malnutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s to see today, unable to get panorex due to clinical
   instability
   - would taper down to only flagyl to cover both dental and c diff
   - f/u cultures, send 3^rd cdiff, but would treat with empiric 14 day
   course of flagyl
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**]. Sinusists: neg CT.
   Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known prior infections include MSSA bacteremia
   (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  - continue levophed, wean as
   tolerated will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI, but was
   broadened when re-spiked, now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]. Would taper as above
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - per renal, if afebrile today, try to place tunneled HD line, can then
   d/c femoral CVVH line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Has menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: EtOH hepatitis; renal failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - weaned levo overnight, now off pressors
   - NPO p MN for IR-guided tunelled HD line placement today
   - liver came by, dismal prognosis
   - dental came by, no real recs, need a panorex
   - bilirubin is largely direct, but hapto is <20 (but this can be seen
   in ESLD and s/p transfusions)
   - PM HCT stable, no transfusions yesterday
   - continued on CVVH, remained afebrile

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has undergone significant changes in her condition, including:

1. Weaning off pressors and extubation, but remaining hypotensive with one pressor requirement.
2. Continued use of CVVH, with a recent change in the femoral HD line.
3. Ongoing pancolitis and dental abscesses, with a CT scan showing concern for dental abscesses and pan-colitis.
4. Positive blood cultures, with a negative TTE, and a pending stool culture.
5. GI bleeding, with clots in the stool, and a trend in HCT that did not increase appropriately after transfusion.
6. Shock, likely septic, with a known prior history of MSSA bacteremia and E coli UTI.
7. Renal failure, likely ATN, with persistent anuria/oliguria, and a need for CVVH.
8. Mental status changes, with a slow recovery expected due to toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH.
9. Anemia, with menses and Hct drifting down, and some clots in the stool.
10. Alcoholic hepatitis, with a recent ultrasound showing evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive), and hepatitis serologies negative.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and potential GI perforation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may progress, leading to end-stage renal disease, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may worsen, leading to hepatic encephalopathy, a life-threatening condition characterized by altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
5. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and pending stool culture may indicate a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Line infections: The patient's multiple lines, including the CVL, a-line, and dialysis catheter, may be at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to hypovolemic shock, fatigue, and potential need for transfusions.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and need for pressors may indicate cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest and potential death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of worsening sepsis, GI bleeding, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, infection, line infections, anemia, and cardiovascular instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of EtOH hepatitis and renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of liver dysfunction, with a bilirubin level of 26.0% and a direct bilirubin level of 23 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.9 g/dL, and his platelet count is 69,000/mL.

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of new abnormalities. The patient's microbiology results are pending, but previous studies have shown yeast growth in the sputum and negative stool O&P.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction and elevated bilirubin levels put him at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
2. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function and elevated creatinine levels put him at risk for further renal failure, which can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's liver dysfunction and impaired immune function put him at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
4. Bleeding: The patient's impaired coagulation function and platelet count put him at risk for bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic complications.
5. Infection: The patient's impaired immune function and presence of central venous catheters put him at risk for developing catheter-related infections, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to his liver dysfunction and potential development of pneumonia.

The patient's plan of care should include close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies. The patient should be continued on CVVH and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis. The patient should also be treated with antibiotics if sepsis is suspected or confirmed. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and he should be considered for liver transplantation if his liver dysfunction is severe and life-threatening."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is currently extubated and is being treated for various complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 90/44 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, and her fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 7,598 mL and a total output of 8,549 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 248 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 73 IU/L. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 24.6 seconds and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.4. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 52 mg/dL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Fever: The patient has been afebrile for 3 days, but she has a history of fever and is being treated with antibiotics.
2. Anemia: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level, but she has small clots in her stool.
3. Hypotension: The patient is still requiring pressor support, likely due to new fever or cirrhosis.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and is receiving dialysis.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and her bilirubin levels are increasing.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and is at risk for aspiration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and abnormal laboratory results may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and small clots in her stool may indicate a bleeding disorder, which can worsen her anemia and lead to complications such as hypovolemic shock.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she is at risk for liver failure, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and bleeding.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and abnormal laboratory results may indicate the presence of renal failure, which can worsen her overall condition and lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Infection: The patient's abnormal laboratory results and fever may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and abnormal laboratory results may indicate the presence of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock, which can worsen her overall condition and lead to complications such as cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - cont zosyn emperically, also continue flagyl to cover both dental and
   c diff
   - f/u cultures, repeat cdiff, but would treat with empiric 14 day
   course of flagyl
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**]
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known prior infections include MSSA bacteremia
   (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  - continue levophed, wean as
   tolerated will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI, but was
   broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**], stopped vanco [**12-8**]
   --> currently zosyn/flagyl
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; if change, repeat CXR
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new femoral HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - cont zosyn emperically, also continue flagyl to cover both dental and
   c diff

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has a complex medical history, including prior infections, shock, ARDS, and ARF.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 35.4°C, HR: 79 bpm, BP: 90/52 mmHg, RR: 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2: 100%.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen, no mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotensive, requiring 1 pressor requirement, with evidence of ongoing pancolitis.
* Gastrointestinal: Ongoing pancolitis, suspected dental abscess, and possible GI bleeding.
* Renal: Anuric/oliguric, likely due to ATN in the setting of shock, requiring CVVH.
* Hepatic: Alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and portal vein thrombus.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, slow to recover due to toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and positive blood cultures suggest a high risk of sepsis.
2. GI bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and ongoing pancolitis increase the risk of further bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's anuric/oliguric state and requirement for CVVH increase the risk of further renal damage.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's worsening liver function and cirrhosis increase the risk of further hepatic failure.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and slow recovery increase the risk of further neurological deterioration.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and ongoing pancolitis increase the risk of further infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy.
* Antibiotics to cover dental and c-diff infections.
* Empiric treatment for MSSA bacteremia and E coli UTI.
* Management of shock with levophed and weaning as tolerated.
* Monitoring of respiratory status and repeat CXR if change is noted.
* Management of anemia with epogen and transfusion for Hct < 24.
* Trending of INR and LFTs, with appreciation of liver input.
* Daily LFTs, coags, and plts.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumpted on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient

   [**2123-12-10**].  Also of note, Vanco was stopped [**2123-12-7**].  Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF, and was intubated on pressors. She has been extubated but remains hypotensive with one pressor requirement. She has ongoing pancolitis, and her INR is elevated. She has had multiple infections, including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI, and has been treated with various antibiotics. She has also had a dental abscess and has been experiencing GI bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated INR and positive blood cultures suggest that she may be at risk for sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's persistent anuria/oliguria and need for CVVH suggest that she may have acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. GI bleeding: The patient's clots in stool and Hct drifting down suggest that she may be at risk for further GI bleeding.
4. Liver failure: The patient's rising T-bili and INR suggest that her liver failure may be worsening.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for 3L NC and possible aspiration during dialysis line placement suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's multiple infections and positive blood cultures suggest that she may be at risk for further infection.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible aspiration during dialysis line placement suggest that she may be at risk for neurological complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid and electrolyte management as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleeding and adjust her transfusion therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her medication therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust her medication therapy as necessary.
7. Consider pursuing a neuro consult to evaluate the patient's altered mental status and potential neurological complications."

   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and required pressors, but is now successfully extubated. The patient remains hypotensive and requires one pressor. She has ongoing pancolitis, fever, and gastrointestinal bleeding. She has completed courses of antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI, but remains on Zosyn and Flagyl empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, positive blood cultures, and ongoing pancolitis suggest ongoing sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding, clots in stool, and ongoing pancolitis increase the risk of further bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's persistent anuria/oliguria and need for CVVH suggest ongoing renal failure.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's worsening liver function, rising bilirubin levels, and need for CVVH suggest ongoing hepatic failure.
5. Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and need for pressors suggest ongoing shock.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for 3L NC and potential aspiration during replacement of femoral dialysis line increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and need for CVVH increase the risk of neurological complications such as encephalopathy.
8. Infections: The patient's ongoing pancolitis, positive blood cultures, and need for antibiotics suggest ongoing infections.
9. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of GI bleeding and ongoing pancolitis increase the risk of further hemorrhage.
10. Multi-organ failure: The patient's ongoing sepsis, renal failure, and hepatic failure increase the risk of multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU, with a stable infiltrate at the right base of the lung, as seen on the CXR. They have been receiving vancomycin for a rising WBC count, with an unclear source of infection. The patient's AM cortisol level is 16.5. They have been receiving various infusions, including calcium gluconate and KCl, through CRRT. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/47 mmHg. Their respiratory support includes SpO2 of 100% and ABG results of 7.37/41/146/19/-1.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, with a peak of 18.7 K/uL. Their blood cultures are pending. Other laboratory results include elevated ALT and AST levels, as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lipase levels. The patient's platelet count is 49, and their hemoglobin is 8.7 g/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and they are receiving vancomycin for a suspected infection. Sepsis is a potential complication that can arise from untreated or undertreated infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's CXR shows a stable infiltrate at the right base of the lung, which could progress to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and their heart rate is within normal limits. However, cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure could arise if the patient's underlying cardiac condition is not managed properly.
4. Renal failure: The patient is receiving CRRT, which is a sign of potential renal failure. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and their urine output is not specified in the note.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lipase levels, which could indicate pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal complications.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which could indicate coagulopathy or bleeding complications.
7. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and they are receiving vancomycin for a suspected infection. Infection is a potential complication that can arise from untreated or undertreated infections.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM). Remains on
   CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess.  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - was inadvertently > 2L  negative this AM with CVP of 1  - bolus 1000
   ML and run even rest of day
   - weaned levophed, aim to to maintain MAP > 60 off of it
   - remains on midodrine, would uptitrate instead of restarting levophed
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**], but later improved and then stabilized
   - trend HCT Daily
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new left IJ HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
     # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been on CVVH and has had multiple antibiotic courses for suspected infections, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pan-colitis and dental abscesses.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.4°C, HR: 82 bpm, BP: 102/47 mmHg, RR: 21 breaths/min, SpO2: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP: 8 mmHg, MAP: 60 mmHg, and on midodrine
* Fluid balance: Total in: 8,566 mL, total out: 8,062 mL, with a balance of 504 mL
* Laboratory results:

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ATN could progress, requiring hemodialysis or further CVVH.
3. GI bleeding: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding could worsen, leading to anemia, hypovolemic shock, and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS could progress, requiring mechanical ventilation and further respiratory support.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure could worsen, leading to increased risk of encephalopathy, coma, and death.
6. Infections: The patient's ongoing infections could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could worsen, leading to bleeding complications and further organ dysfunction.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance could worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
9. Metabolic derangements: The patient's metabolic derangements could worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and failure.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue CVVH and hemodynamic support with midodrine.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's GI bleeding and provide transfusions as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and provide hemodialysis or further CVVH as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and provide supportive care for liver failure.
6. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and provide transfusions as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalance and provide replacement therapy as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's metabolic derangements and provide supportive care as needed.
9. Consider head CT and neuro consult for prognosis if the patient's mental status does not improve.
10. Consider removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery to address the dental abscess."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM). Remains on
   CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess.  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - was inadvertently > 2L  negative this AM with CVP of 1  - bolus 1000
   ML and run even rest of day
   - weaned levophed, aim to to maintain MAP > 60 off of it
   - remains on midodrine, would uptitrate instead of restarting levophed
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**], but later improved and then stabilized
   - trend HCT Daily
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new left IJ HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
     # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: EtOH hepatitis, ARF on CVVHD, altered MS
   24 Hour Events:
   -- increased midodrine to 10mg TID
   -- CVP was low, and varied with respirations, suggesting hypovolemia.
   Gave saline boluses to increase CVP to ~15 prior to upping pressors.
   However, I did write her for vasopressin just in case (not yet used)
   -- started risperdal for ? ICU psychosis on top of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   -- checked EKG to make sure no PR prolongation - none seen

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated on pressors, but is now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors. The patient remains on CVVH and has been experiencing low-grade fever, likely related to septic shock, with a possible source being a dental abscess or pancolitis. She has also had GI bleeding, anemia, and renal failure, likely due to ATN.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's fever and septicemia may lead to further deterioration, requiring close monitoring and aggressive treatment.
2. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleeding may continue, requiring close monitoring and transfusion of blood products.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may progress, requiring further dialysis and close monitoring of electrolyte levels.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, requiring close monitoring of liver function tests and treatment with lactulose and rifaximin.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring further transfusion of blood products and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels.
6. Infections: The patient's septicemia and GI bleeding may lead to further infections, requiring close monitoring and aggressive treatment.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, requiring close monitoring and consideration of reintubation.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen, requiring close monitoring and treatment with vasopressors.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies closely.
2. Continue treatment with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for septicemia.
3. Consider repeating cultures to determine the source of the infection.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleeding and anemia, and transfuse blood products as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider further dialysis if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist for further evaluation and management of the patient's altered mental status.
8. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and management of the patient's septicemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   - remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (will touch base
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**], but later improved and then stabilized
   - trend HCT Daily
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new left IJ HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
     # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   - remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (will touch base
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**], but later improved and then stabilized
   - trend HCT Daily
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new left IJ HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
     # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

**Vital Signs:**

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart Rate: 94 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood Pressure: 91/42 mmHg
* Respiratory Rate: 24 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen Saturation: 97%

**Laboratory Results:**

* White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 14.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.0 g/dL
* Platelet Count (Plt): 48 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 20 mg/dL
* Liver Function Tests (LFTs): ALT 71 IU/L, AST 227 IU/L
* Coagulation Studies: INR 2.8, PTT 71.1 seconds
* Electrolytes: Na 135 mmol/L, K 4.1 mmol/L, Cl 103 mmol/L, CO2 25 mmol/L

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Septic Shock:** The patient's septic shock may be related to prior infections, including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI, as well as recent imaging suggesting pan-colitis and dental abscess.
2. **Fever:** The patient's low-grade fever may be related to ongoing infection, and it is unclear whether it is related to the dialysis line placement or other sources.
3. **GI Bleeding:** The patient had clots in their stool, which may be related to liver failure and coagulopathy.
4. **Renal Failure:** The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria, which may be related to ATN in the setting of shock.
5. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to toxic and metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH.
6. **Alcoholic Hepatitis:** The patient has cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus, which may worsen liver function and increase the risk of bleeding.
7. **Coagulopathy:** The patient has a prolonged INR and PT, which may increase the risk of bleeding.

**Plan:**

1. Continue antibiotics for septic shock and fever.
2. Monitor respiratory status and consider CXR and CT scans as needed.
3. Trend HCT and transfuse as necessary to maintain a HCT > 24.
4. Continue CVVH and consider transitioning to HD if the patient's renal function improves.
5. Monitor mental status and consider a head CT or neuro consult if the patient's mental status does not improve.
6. Continue lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Trend INR and coagulation studies, and consider transfusing platelets and FFP as necessary.
8. Monitor for signs of bleeding and consider prophylactic transfusions.
9. Consider a liver consult to assess the patient's liver function and potential need for liver transplantation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   - remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (will touch base
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),

   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately

   - trend HCT Daily
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new left IJ HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been intubated and is now extubated, weaning off pressors. She is on CVVH and has completed courses of antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia and E coli UTI. She has a history of pan-colitis and dental abscesses, and recent imaging suggests pancolitis and dental abscesses. She has a low-grade fever, and her WBC count has increased. She has a high risk of aspiration, and dental consultation is recommended.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to prior infections, including MSSA bacteremia and E coli UTI, as well as pan-colitis and dental abscesses.
2. ARF: The patient's ARF is likely due to ATN in the setting of shock.
3. GI bleeding: The patient has had clots in her stool and has been transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely due to ATN in the setting of shock, and she requires renal assistance.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Anemia: The patient has had menses and her Hct has been drifting down.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has had a high INR and low platelets, indicating poor synthetic function of the liver.
8. Pan-colitis and dental abscesses: The patient has a high risk of aspiration and requires dental consultation.
9. Aspiration: The patient has had a low-grade fever and has been at risk of aspiration during dialysis line placement and dental procedures.
10. Infection: The patient has had a positive blood culture and is at risk of developing further infections.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
2. Continue to administer antibiotics and antifungal medications as prescribed.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including IV fluids and pressors as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her medication regimen accordingly.
6. Consider performing a head CT or neuro consultation to assess the patient's mental status and prognosis.
7. Consider removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery.
8. Continue to provide prophylactic medications, including H2 blockers and stress ulcer medication.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and platelet count and adjust her anticoagulation regimen accordingly.
10. Consider performing a tunneled HD catheter placement when the patient's INR and platelet count are stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/45 mmHg. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including pressors, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals icteric sclera, poor dentition, and a systolic murmur. The patient's abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, but the patient's extremities are absent. The patient's skin is jaundiced, and the neurologic examination reveals attentiveness, ability to follow simple commands, and response to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show the patient's liver function is impaired, with a bilirubin level of 8.0 g/dL and an INR of 2.8. The patient's renal function is also impaired, with an anuria and a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's anemia is stable, with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: The patient is off pressors, and the CVP goal is 7-12 mmHg.
* Liver Failure: The patient is receiving lactulose and rifaxamin, and liver function will be monitored if the patient can remain off pressors.
* Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric and is receiving CVVH. If the patient's blood pressure remains stable, HD may be trialed, and a tunneled line will be needed at some point.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, and transfusion goals are >21%.
* Mental status: The patient is receiving risperdal to manage ICU delirium.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued liver and renal failure, potentially leading to further impairment of these organs.
* Hypotension, potentially leading to decreased perfusion of vital organs.
* Anemia, potentially leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Mental status changes, potentially leading to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
* Infection, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and medication administration. The patient's family should be educated on their condition and the potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is being monitored for hypotension, with a goal CVP of 7-12. The patient's liver function remains altered, and they are being treated with lactulose and rifaxamin. Renal failure is present, and the patient is anuric, requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has anemia, but no signs of active bleeding, and is being transfused to maintain a hemoglobin level above 21%. The patient's mental status is impaired due to toxic-metabolic insults and ICU delirium, and they are being treated with risperdal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is at risk for further hypotension, particularly if their CVP goal is not met. This could lead to decreased organ perfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is significantly altered, and they are at risk for further deterioration. This could lead to decreased detoxification, altered metabolism, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and requires CVVH. If their renal function does not improve, they may require hemodialysis, which carries its own set of risks and complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being treated with transfusions, but they are at risk for further blood loss or transfusion reactions.
5. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is impaired due to toxic-metabolic insults and ICU delirium. This could lead to further cognitive decline, increased risk of falls, and decreased ability to communicate effectively.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to their prolonged ICU stay, altered immune function, and presence of invasive lines and catheters.
7. Organ Failure: The patient is at risk for multi-organ failure, particularly if their liver and renal function do not improve. This could lead to a significantly decreased quality of life and increased mortality."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
    # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
    # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Restarted on pressors, suspect that her baseline BP is in
   this range.
     -Wean pressors today, MAP goal >50.
     -Add florinef
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 98 bpm (normal range: 91-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/42 mmHg (normal range: 78/34-107/50 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute (normal range: 21-31 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on pressors and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg.

The patient has the following laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 10.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 22.1%
* Platelet count: 37 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 19 mEq/L
* Electrolytes: Sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 105 mEq/L
* Liver function tests: Bilirubin 8.0 g/dL, INR 3.1
* Coagulation studies: PT 30.0 seconds, PTT 77.0 seconds, INR 3.1

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Hypotension: The patient has been restarted on pressors and the goal is to wean them over the next 24 hours. The patient's baseline blood pressure is suspected to be in the range of 84/42 mmHg.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 37 K/uL, which is likely related to medications. The potential suspects include H2 blockers, vancomycin, and Zosyn. The antibiotics have been discontinued and the H2 blocker has been changed to a proton pump inhibitor.
* Liver failure: The patient has significant liver dysfunction, with bilirubin 8.0 g/dL and INR 3.1. The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
* Renal failure: The patient is anuric and is receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The goal is to trial hemodialysis (HD) if the patient's blood pressure remains stable over the next 24-48 hours.
* Anemia: The patient has a hematocrit of 22.1%, which is stable. The patient is being transfused to a goal of >21%.
* Mental status: The patient has ICU delirium and is being treated with risperdal.

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning pressors over the next 24 hours
* Discontinuing antibiotics
* Changing the H2 blocker to a proton pump inhibitor
* Continuing lactulose and rifaximin for liver failure
* Continuing CVVH for renal failure
* Trial of HD if blood pressure remains stable
* Transfusion to a goal of >21%
* Monitoring the patient's mental status and treating with risperdal as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been experiencing several complications. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 98 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 84/42 mmHg (MAP goal >50)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* White blood cell count: 10.8 K/uL

The patient has been experiencing hypotension overnight, which was treated with pressors. The patient's thrombocytopenia is suspected to be related to medications, particularly H2 blockers, Vancomycin, and Zosyn. The patient's liver function is significantly altered, with elevated bilirubin and INR levels. The patient remains anuric and is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient has also been experiencing anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL. The patient's mental status is impaired, with signs of ICU delirium. The patient is receiving risperdal to manage their mental status.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and vasopressors. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's anuric state and altered liver function make them susceptible to sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and altered coagulation profile increase their risk of bleeding.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's anuric state and continued use of CVVH increase their risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Liver failure: The patient's ongoing liver dysfunction and elevated bilirubin and INR levels increase their risk of liver failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's ongoing anemia and need for transfusions increase their risk of bleeding and other complications.
6. Delirium: The patient's impaired mental status and ongoing ICU delirium increase their risk of falls, medication errors, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing antibiotic use increase their risk of infection.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis, bleeding, and acute kidney injury. The patient's liver function should be closely monitored, and lactulose and rifaxamin should be continued to manage their liver failure. The patient's anemia should be closely monitored, and transfusions should be given as needed. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and risperdal should be continued to manage their delirium."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and required pressors, but has since been successfully extubated and is weaning off pressors. She remains on CVVH and has a history of septic shock, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient has a history of septic shock and is still at risk of developing further infections, particularly given her immunocompromised state and presence of central lines.
2. **Renal Failure:** The patient's renal function is likely to remain impaired, and she may require ongoing dialysis support.
3. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's liver function is still impaired, and she may be at risk of developing further hepatic encephalopathy, particularly given her history of EtOH hepatitis and cirrhosis.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly given her history of poor dental health and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. **Malnutrition:** The patient's nutritional status is likely to be compromised, particularly given her history of liver disease and ongoing dialysis support.
6. **Mental Status Changes:** The patient's mental status is still impaired, and she may be at risk of developing further cognitive decline or hallucinations.
7. **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The patient's history of poor dental health and potential gastrointestinal bleeding may increase her risk of developing further bleeding complications.
8. **Dental Abscess:** The patient's dental abscess may require further treatment, particularly given her history of septic shock and potential risk of developing further infections.

**Plan:**

1. Continue CVVH and monitor the patient's renal function.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider further neuroconsultation if necessary.
3. Continue antibiotics for presumed C. diff and monitor for further signs of infection.
4. Consider further dental evaluation and treatment to address the patient's dental abscess.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider further nutritional support.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk.
7. Consider further liver function tests and coagulation studies to monitor the patient's liver function and bleeding risk."

   Imaging: no new imaging

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been intubated and on pressors, but has now been successfully extubated and is being weaned off pressors.

   Imaging: no new imaging
   Microbiology: No new culture data since [**2123-12-10**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.

   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, is currently in the ICU due to acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated on pressors but has been successfully extubated and is weaning off pressors. She remains on CVVH and has a history of septic shock, likely caused by MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and possible aspiration or transient bacteremia during dialysis line placement. The patient has also developed pancreatitis, dental abscesses, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock may persist or recur, leading to further complications such as organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or death.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further neurological decline or death.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
5. Dental Abscesses: The patient's dental abscesses may spread to other areas of the body, leading to sepsis or death.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Infection: The patient is at high risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or death.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
10. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status may worsen, leading to further neurological decline, coma, or death.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her for these potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50.
     -D/C florinef as it likely has no effect in setting of renal failure
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's a
   little down over the last 2 days
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Continue CVVH
     -If BP remains stable over the next 24-48 hours, would trial HD
     -Will need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, currently receiving care in the ICU. The patient has been weaned off pressors overnight, and their vital signs are stable, with a MAP goal of >50. They have been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, liver failure, renal failure, anemia, and mental status changes. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and anticoagulants, and has undergone CVVH and is awaiting tunneled line placement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's MAP goal is >50, and they are at risk of developing hypotension if their blood pressure drops further.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and they are at risk of developing bleeding complications if not transfused with platelets.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's bilirubin and INR levels are elevated, and they are at risk of developing further liver damage if not managed properly.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and at risk of developing further kidney damage if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT level is low, and they are at risk of developing further anemia if not transfused with blood products.
6. Mental Status Changes: The patient is at risk of developing further mental status changes if not managed properly, and may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to their compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines.
8. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of developing bleeding complications due to their thrombocytopenia and anticoagulant therapy.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure if their respiratory status worsens.
10. Cardiac Complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, if their cardiac status worsens.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust their medication regimen as necessary.
2. Continue to transfuse platelets and blood products as necessary to manage thrombocytopenia and anemia.
3. Continue to manage the patient's liver and renal failure with lactulose, rifaxamin, and CVVH.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust their medication regimen as necessary.
5. Consider placing a tunneled line to improve vascular access.
6. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust their respiratory support as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust their medication regimen as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50.
     -D/C florinef as it likely has no effect in setting of renal failure
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's a
   little down over the last 2 days
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Continue CVVH
     -If BP remains stable over the next 24-48 hours, would trial HD
     -Will need tunneled line at some point.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch-tall, 89.4 kg individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown chief complaint. The patient has been weaned off pressors overnight and is currently on vancomycin, Zosyn, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% and an ABG of 7.38/36/161/19/-2. The patient's physical examination reveals icteric sclera, oozing from the right lip, and soft, non-tender abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, anemia, and liver and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 16 K/uL, which is below the normal range. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if the patient requires invasive procedures.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's bilirubin level is 7.8 g/dL, and INR is 3.2, indicating liver failure. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications, and the patient may require transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, indicating renal failure. This may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremic complications.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.8 g/dL, indicating anemia. This may increase the risk of fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status is altered, with somnolence and difficulty arousing. This may be due to toxic-metabolic insults, ICU delirium, or other underlying conditions.
6. Infections: The patient is at risk for infections due to the presence of central lines, arterial lines, and dialysis catheters.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure is 98/47 mmHg, which is within the normal range, but may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen, which may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and management to prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated on pressors but has since been successfully extubated and is weaning off pressors. She remains on CVVH and has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, likely due to poor production, ESLD, and possible consumption. She has also been diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to prior infections, including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Her fever has resolved, but her WBC count has increased again, and she has a positive blood culture. She has been treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.1°C, HR 93 bpm, BP 90/42 mmHg, RR 26 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 9 mmHg, MAP 50 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total in 9,693 mL, total out 7,057 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device none
* Labs: WBC 11 K/uL, Hct 22.4%, Plt 16, Cr 0.6 mg/dL, TCO2 22 mmHg, Glucose 101 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and possible consumption may increase her risk of bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's septic shock and positive blood culture suggest a high risk of infection, which may be difficult to treat given her compromised immune system.
3. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and oliguria may worsen her renal function, leading to further complications.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which may worsen her mental status.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's septic shock and hypotension may lead to cardiovascular instability, which may be difficult to manage.
6. GI complications: The patient's pancreatitis and possible GI bleeding may lead to further complications, such as abscesses or perforation.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient's ARDS and possible aspiration may lead to further pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's septic shock with fluids and vasopressors as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and monitoring.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her fluid management and vasopressor therapy accordingly.
5. Consider consulting a liver specialist to optimize the patient's liver function and manage her liver-related complications.
6. Consider consulting a pulmonary specialist to optimize the patient's respiratory function and manage her respiratory-related complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider consulting a neurologist if her mental status worsens."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption/DIC.  Slow oozing
   from cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.  Platelets 16
 11 overnight with one bag of platelets.
   -- will give two bags of platelets to get Plts > 20; will recheck this
   afternoon
   -- fibrinogen level pending
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- renal feels will not tolerate HD
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated on pressors but is now extubated and weaning off pressors. The patient remains on CVVH and has been transfused with one unit of platelets.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.1°C, HR 93 bpm, BP 90/42 mmHg, RR 26 breaths/min, SpO2 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 9 mmHg, MAP 50 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total In 9,693 mL, Total Out 7,057 mL, Fluid Balance 2,636 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device none, SpO2 100%
* Laboratory results: WBC 11.8 K/μL, Hct 22.4%, Plt 16, Cr 0.6 mg/dL, TCO2 22 mmHg, Glucose 105 mg/dL

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial, with platelet count of 16
2. Shock: likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement
3. Fever: resolved, with WBC count of 11.8 K/μL
4. Renal failure: likely ATN, with persistent anuria/oliguria
5. Mental status: waxing and waning, with possible toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH
6. Anemia: stable in low to mid-20 range, with clots in stool and menses
7. Alcoholic hepatitis: with cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus, and grave prognosis

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
2. Organ failure, including hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular
3. Infection, including sepsis and C. difficile
4. Pan-colitis and dental abscesses
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
6. Hepatic encephalopathy
7. Renal failure requiring dialysis

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continued CVVH
2. Transfusion of two bags of platelets to achieve a platelet count > 20
3. Fibrinogen level pending
4. Fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
5. Midodrine 10 mg TID for shock
6. Flagyl empirically for presumed C. difficile
7. Lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
8. Risperdal PRN for hallucinations and delirium
9. Epogen per renal for anemia
10. Transfusion to > 21 for anemia

   [**2123-12-10**] BCx x 2: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with etoh hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, likely due to poor production, ESLD, and possible consumption. She has also had septic shock, which has been treated with antibiotics and fluids. The patient has been experiencing fever, which has resolved, and has had a positive blood culture. She has also had a positive CT scan, which suggests pan-colitis and dental abscesses. The patient has been experiencing renal failure, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. She has also been experiencing mental status changes, which are likely due to toxic and metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and recent bleeding from a cracked corner of her mouth make her at risk for bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient's septic shock and positive blood culture suggest that she may be at risk for further infection.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ATN and anuria/oliguria make her at risk for further decline in renal function.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver disease and recent elevation in bilirubin levels make her at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's septic shock and recent elevation in blood pressure make her at risk for cardiovascular complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's recent mental status changes and possible aspiration of gastric contents make her at risk for neurological complications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent elevation in bilirubin levels and possible pancreatitis make her at risk for gastrointestinal complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk.
2. Continue to treat the patient's septic shock with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider dialysis if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider a neuro consult if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplant if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider cardiovascular medications if necessary.
7. Consider a gastrointestinal consult to evaluate the patient's pancreatitis and possible need for surgical intervention."

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50, will check lactate for any signs of hypoperfusion
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects included H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
     -Check DIC labs
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Discuss with renal timing of HD trial.  Need to establish some
   endpoints since remaining indefiinitely on CVVH is not an option.
     -Would need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects included H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
     -Check DIC labs
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Discuss with renal timing of HD trial.  Need to establish some
   endpoints since remaining indefiinitely on CVVH is not an option.
     -Would need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for management of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing hypotension, thrombocytopenia, liver failure, renal failure, and encephalopathy.

The patient was weaned off pressors overnight, and her baseline blood pressure is suspected to be around 82/37 mmHg. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to medications, and platelet transfusion is planned to achieve a goal of >20. The patient's liver function remains altered, with bilirubin levels stabilized in the high 20's, and lactulose and rifaxamin are continued to manage liver failure.

The patient remains anuric and will require discussion with the renal team regarding the timing of hemodialysis (HD) trial. The patient's anemia is stable, with no signs of active bleeding, and a transfusion goal of >21% is set. The patient's mental status is altered due to toxic-metabolic insults and ICU delirium, and risperdal is being used to manage this.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: Prolonged hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: Bleeding complications can occur if platelet levels drop below 20.
3. Liver failure: Progression of liver failure can lead to increased bilirubin levels, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy.
4. Renal failure: Prolonged anuria can lead to acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
5. Encephalopathy: Worsening of encephalopathy can lead to decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Sepsis: Continued sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, failure, and increased mortality.
7. Coagulopathy: Prolonged coagulopathy can lead to bleeding complications and increased risk of mortality.

To mitigate these complications, the patient will require close monitoring, aggressive management of sepsis, and optimization of organ function. The patient's family will need to be involved in the decision-making process regarding withdrawal of care, given the patient's persistent liver and kidney failure, as well as encephalopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects included H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
     -Check DIC labs
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Discuss with renal timing of HD trial.
     -Would need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch tall, 90.7 kg individual who has been admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy, liver failure, renal failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is being monitored for hypotension. The patient's liver function is stabilized, but the bilirubin levels remain elevated. The patient remains anuric and is being considered for hemodialysis. The patient's mental status is impaired due to toxic-metabolic insults and ICU delirium. The patient's family has been informed of the patient's condition, and the possibility of withdrawing care has been discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but the patient is at risk for hypotension due to the weaning off pressors. Monitoring of lactate levels and MAP goals will be necessary to prevent hypoperfusion.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient is at risk for bleeding. Transfusion of platelets is necessary to achieve a goal of >20.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is stabilized, but the bilirubin levels remain elevated. Monitoring of liver function and continuation of lactulose and rifaxamin will be necessary to prevent further liver damage.
4. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric and is at risk for further kidney damage. Discussion with the renal team regarding the timing of hemodialysis trial is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not severe, but the patient is at risk for further anemia due to ongoing bleeding or blood loss. Transfusion goal of >21% will be necessary to prevent further anemia.
6. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is impaired due to toxic-metabolic insults and ICU delirium. Monitoring of the patient's mental status and continuation of risperdal will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal examination is normal, but the patient is at risk for gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's liver failure and anemia.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and dialysis catheter.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now successfully
   extubated, still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   without running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption/DIC.  Slow oozing
   from cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.  Platelets 16
 11 overnight with one bag of platelets.
   -- will give two bags of platelets to get Plts > 20; will recheck this
   afternoon
   -- fibrinogen level pending
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- renal feels will not tolerate HD
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now successfully
   extubated, still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   without running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption/DIC.  Slow oozing

   -- will give two bags of platelets to get Plts > 20; will recheck this

   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental

   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:

   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis and was previously intubated and on pressors.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count has decreased from 11 to 4 after two bags of platelets. The patient is likely to receive two more bags of platelets to increase platelet count above 20.
* Shock: The patient is still hypotensive, but her pressor requirement has resolved. The etiology of septic shock is suspected to be related to prior infections, including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI.
* Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but her WBC count has increased to 11.8, which may indicate a possible source of infection.
* Renal failure: The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria and is likely to have ATN in the setting of shock. CVVH is being used for supportive care, and the patient is not tolerating HD at this point.
* Mental status: The patient's mental status is still altered, and she is at risk of slow recovery due to toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH.
* Anemia: The patient has been stable with a hemoglobin level in the low to mid-20 range over the last few days.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy make her at risk for bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and increased WBC count suggest that she may be at risk for further sepsis and organ failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's persistent anuria/oliguria and need for CVVH suggest that she may be at risk for further renal failure and potential need for dialysis.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is still compromised, and she may be at risk for further decompensation and potential need for liver transplantation.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential for further neurological decline make her at risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as needed to maintain a platelet count above 20.
* Continue to manage the patient's shock with fluid boluses and titration of CVVH parameters.
* Continue to monitor the patient's WBC count and consider further evaluation for potential sources of infection.
* Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with CVVH and consider further evaluation for potential need for dialysis.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation for potential neurological complications.
* Consider further evaluation for potential liver transplantation if the patient's liver function does not improve.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as necessary to prevent further complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now successfully
   extubated, still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   without running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- off antibiotics except flagyl
   -- DIC is possible despite nl fibrinogen as this is also an [**Month (only) **]
   -- heaptic dysfunction also contributing
   -- will give two bags of platelets now, recheck post transfusion, but
   if DIC this will only
fuel the fire
   # Shock: Likely septic. Etiology of septic shock could include prior
   infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1
   treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest
   pan-colitis and dental abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.
   Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever:Resolved, but now hypotermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no fever overnight and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting today to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical condition, including:

1. Acute liver failure and cirrhosis due to ethanol hepatitis
2. Septic shock, likely caused by a combination of factors, including prior infections, pan-colitis, and dental abscesses
3. Thrombocytopenia, likely multifactorial, including poor platelet production due to ESLD, medication effects (zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/DIC
4. Renal failure, likely ATN, with anuria/oliguria and inability to tolerate HD
5. Hypotension, requiring CVVH support
6. Fever, resolved, but with concerns about aspiration, transient bacteremia, or other sources
7. Altered mental status, likely due to toxic and metabolic derangements, renal failure, and need for CVVH
8. Anemia, with clots in stool and menses
9. Hepatic encephalopathy, managed with lactulose and rifaximin
10. Grave prognosis, with a planned family meeting to discuss the patient's condition

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Further bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction
2. Development of DIC, which could worsen the patient's condition
3. Increased risk of infections, particularly in the setting of septic shock and compromised immune function
4. Progression of renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease
5. Complications related to CVVH, such as bleeding, infection, or catheter-related complications
6. Development of liver failure, potentially leading to multi-organ failure
7. Respiratory complications, such as ARDS, due to septic shock and multi-organ failure
8. Neurological complications, such as seizures or coma, due to hepatic encephalopathy and toxic/metabolic derangements

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Has stayed off pressors but has required significant
   positive fluid balance. Lactate normal with MAPs in the 50's.
     -MAP goal >50
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds +/- abnormal
   sequestration +/- DIC +/- autoimmune.  Potential med suspects included
   H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been stopped.
      -Appreciate heme input.  Apparently coombs test today is positive.
   Will discuss with heme regarding ?need for steroids
      -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -No plans to try HD given poor BP.
     -Will try holding CVVH to see if BP improves over the next 24-48
   hours.  If BP not better, would advocate to not restart CVVH.
    Anemia:  Diffuse oozing related to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
     -Transfusion goal >21%, 2 units PRBC today
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Hypotension:  Has stayed off pressors but has required significant
   positive fluid balance. Lactate normal with MAPs in the 50's.
     -MAP goal >50
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds +/- abnormal
   sequestration +/- DIC +/- autoimmune.  Potential med suspects included
   H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been stopped.
      -Appreciate heme input.  Apparently coombs test today is positive.
   Will discuss with heme regarding ?need for steroids
      -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -No plans to try HD given poor BP.
     -Will try holding CVVH to see if BP improves over the next 24-48
   hours.  If BP not better, would advocate to not restart CVVH.
    Anemia:  Diffuse oozing related to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
     -Transfusion goal >21%, 2 units PRBC today
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multi-organ dysfunction. The patient's condition has been unstable, with significant fluid shifts, hypotension, and coagulopathy.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 4,000, which has responded to platelet transfusions
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and Alk Phos) and bilirubin, suggesting liver failure
* Renal failure, with anuria and a need for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH)
* Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL
* Coagulopathy, with a prolonged PT and PTT, and a positive Coombs test

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Icteric sclera
* Jaundice
* Distended abdomen
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present
* Right and left extremities with 2+ edema
* Skin not assessed

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 95 bpm (88-102 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 80/38 mmHg (54/35-96/47 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (15-29 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Central venous pressure: 11 mmHg (2-12 mmHg)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Multi-organ failure, particularly liver and kidney failure
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Anemia and hemorrhage
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrest
* Encephalopathy and delirium
* Infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Fluid management to maintain a positive balance
* Blood product transfusions to address thrombocytopenia and anemia
* Medications to manage liver failure, including lactulose and rifaximin
* Renal replacement therapy with CVVH
* Monitoring of liver function and potential need for steroids
* Consideration of withdrawal of care given the patient's persistent liver and kidney failure, and encephalopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, anemia, liver failure, and renal failure. The patient's platelet count has dropped to 4,000 after platelet transfusion, and they are experiencing oozing from catheter and blood draw sites. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with a bilirubin level of 7.1 g/dL and an INR of 3.0. The patient's renal function is also impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and a urine output of 1,200 mL.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 99% and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's cardiovascular status is unstable, with a blood pressure of 80/38 mmHg and a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg. The patient's neurologic status is also impaired, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin and INR levels. The patient's kidney function is also impaired, with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.

The patient's medical history is significant for liver disease, kidney disease, and anemia. The patient has been receiving treatment for their conditions, including platelet transfusions, antibiotics, and antifungals.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly from catheter and blood draw sites.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and pneumonia.
3. Organ failure: The patient's liver and kidney failure may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential death.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further neurologic decline and potential death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and potential death.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly from the esophagus or stomach.
8. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of sepsis, particularly if the patient develops an infection.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's liver and kidney failure may worsen, leading to metabolic acidosis and potential death.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- continue prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, ARDS, and ARF, and was intubated on pressors. She has since been extubated and is still CVVH dependent. The patient has multiple ongoing medical issues, including thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, renal failure, anemia, and liver dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and ongoing bleeding may worsen, requiring further transfusions and platelet support.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may persist, requiring continued pressor support and optimization of her fluid and electrolyte status.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may progress, requiring continued CVVH and potential dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures may indicate ongoing infection, requiring continued antibiotic therapy and surveillance for sepsis.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy may worsen, requiring continued lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring continued epogen therapy and transfusions.
7. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction may persist, requiring continued monitoring of her liver function tests and coagulation studies.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status may worsen, requiring continued monitoring of her blood pressure and cardiac function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue platelet transfusions as needed to support the patient's bleeding.
2. Optimize the patient's fluid and electrolyte status to support her hypotension.
3. Continue CVVH and consider dialysis if the patient's renal function does not improve.
4. Continue antibiotic therapy for the patient's ongoing infection.
5. Continue lactulose and rifaximin therapy for the patient's hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Continue epogen therapy and transfusions to support the patient's anemia.
7. Continue monitoring the patient's liver function tests and coagulation studies to assess her liver dysfunction.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications as needed to support her blood pressure and cardiac function.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to address these potential medical complications and optimize her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with EtOH-associated hepatitis and ESLD, MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, shock, ARDS, complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, and MODS. The patient is extubated, but with fluctuating mental status. He is still requiring CVVH and is anuric. The patient is persistently hypotensive, requiring midodrine to spare conventional vasopressors.

The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 5-7 K/uL, which is likely multifactorial due to DIC, liver disease, and possibly ITP. He is currently on prednisone 90mg for 3 days.

The patient's CV status is hypotensive, likely at his baseline given his liver disease. He is on midodrine to keep MAPs >50.

The patient has ARF requiring CVVH, which is likely due to ATN. He is anuric and will continue to receive CVVH.

The patient has a GI condition, likely EtOH-induced hepatitis, and is on tube feeds. He is not a transplant candidate.

The patient has a renal condition, ARF requiring CVVH, and is anuric. He will continue to receive CVVH.

The patient has an ID condition, likely pan-colitis, and is on flagyl for 2 weeks.

The patient has an endocrine condition, with sugars okay.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Further deterioration of liver function, leading to worsening of coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia or UTI.
3. Progression of ARF to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Development of respiratory failure due to worsening of ARDS.
5. Further deterioration of mental status due to worsening of encephalopathy.
6. Development of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to ongoing GI condition.
7. Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and underlying thrombocytopenia.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with EtOH-associated hepatitis and ESLD, MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH, and MODS. The patient is hypotensive, requiring midodrine, and thrombocytopenic, potentially due to DIC, liver disease, or ITP. The patient has been extubated but remains on CVVH and is anuric. The patient has fluctuating mental status and is receiving corticosteroids for possible ITP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, which could be exacerbated by CVVH.
2. Hypotension, which could worsen organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
3. ARF, which could progress to chronic kidney disease or require long-term dialysis.
4. MODS, which could lead to multi-organ failure and increased mortality.
5. Infection, particularly of the respiratory, urinary, or gastrointestinal tracts, which could be exacerbated by immunosuppressive therapy.
6. Liver failure, which could lead to increased mortality and the need for liver transplantation.
7. Pan-colitis, which could worsen gut dysfunction and increase the risk of sepsis.
8. C. difficile infection, which could worsen gut dysfunction and increase the risk of sepsis.
9. ITP, which could worsen bleeding risk and require additional therapy.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Monitor platelet count and transfuse platelets only if bleeding occurs.
2. Continue corticosteroids for possible ITP.
3. Monitor for signs of bleeding and hypotension.
4. Continue CVVH and monitor for signs of ARF.
5. Monitor for signs of MODS and adjust therapy accordingly.
6. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust therapy accordingly.
7. Monitor liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
8. Monitor gut function and adjust therapy accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Heme-
      a) Thrombocytopenia likely multifactorial (DIC, liver disease, ?
   ITP).  Currently on Prednisone 90mg day.
           i) Will transfuse platelets only if bleeding given no response
   to platelet transfusions.  Avoid medicines known to cause
               thrombocytopenia.
          ii) Crit goal >21%
          iii) Check daily fibrinogens
          iv) DVT prophy with boots.
   2) CV
        a) hypotensive, likely at her baseline given her liver disease.
   Prior w/u to exclude infection has been unrevealing.
        b) On Midodrine to keep MAPs>50
   3) Resp- on RA.  Incentive spirometry
       a) Keep I/O's even to slightly neg as tolerated
       b) CHANGE nebs to standing, given wheezing (cardiac wheezes vs
   bronchoconstriction?)
   4) GI-
        a) on tube feeds
        b) Hepatitis likely [**1-3**] EtOH, other etiologies ruled out
             - Not transplant candidate
             - On Rifaximin, Lactulose
             - Not on SBP prophylaxis, not indicated
   5) Renal- ARF requiring CVVH , likely due to ATN
          - anuric
          - Continue CVVH
          - I/O = will keep even today, as blood pressures tolerate.
   6) ID- On flagyl for pan-colitis (likely moreso ischemic).  C. diff
   have been negative, but plan to finish 2week course flagyl.
   7) Endo- SUGARS OK

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition :
   Total time spent:  50 minutes, patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old individual with EtOH-associated hepatitis and ESLD, complicated by MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, shock, ARDS, and MODS. The patient is currently extubated but still requires CVVH due to anuric ARF.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm
* Blood pressure: 77/41 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 5 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.8-8.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 5-7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.0 g/dL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mEq/L
* Electrolytes: 139 mEq/L, 3.8 mEq/L, 10 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* LDH: 238 IU/L
* Ca++: 9.6 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial (DIC, liver disease,? ITP)
2. Hypotension: likely at baseline given liver disease
3. ARF: requiring CVVH, likely due to ATN
4. MODS: with potential for multi-organ failure
5. Pan-colitis: likely ischemic, treated with Flagyl
6. ARDS: with potential for respiratory failure
7. ESLD: with potential for liver failure

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Thrombocytopenia management: platelet transfusions only if bleeding, avoid medicines known to cause thrombocytopenia
2. CV management: continue Midodrine to keep MAPs > 50
3. Respiratory management: incentive spirometry, keep I/O's even to slightly negative as tolerated
4. GI management: continue tube feeds, monitor for signs of bleeding or perforation
5. Renal management: continue CVVH, monitor for signs of improvement or worsening
6. ID management: finish 2-week course of Flagyl for pan-colitis
7. Endocrine management: monitor for signs of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is critical care unit."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- continue prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   - prednisone for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- continue prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and placed on pressors, but was later extubated and transferred to the ICU with ongoing CVVH dependence, hypotension, and failing hepatic synthetic function. The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, likely multifactorial, and is being treated with prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA. She also has hypotension, likely due to septic shock, and is being treated with midodrine and flagyl. The patient has ongoing renal failure, likely ATN, and is being treated with CVVH. She has also been diagnosed with anemia and is being treated with epogen and transfusions. The patient's mental status is waxing and waning, and she is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and ongoing bleeding may lead to further complications, including hemorrhagic shock.
2. Infection: The patient's septic shock and ongoing infections, including a possible C. difficile infection, may lead to further complications, including sepsis and organ failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's ongoing renal failure may lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and end-stage renal disease.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ongoing liver failure may lead to further complications, including hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's ongoing hypotension and shock may lead to further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest and cardiac failure.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's ongoing ARDS may lead to further respiratory complications, including respiratory failure and death.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's ongoing mental status changes and risk of hepatic encephalopathy may lead to further neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and

   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing

   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is currently extubated and receiving CVVH support. Her condition remains unstable, with ongoing thrombocytopenia, hypotension, and renal failure. She has a grave prognosis and is at risk for further complications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Bleeding:** The patient's thrombocytopenia and ongoing CVVH support increase the risk of bleeding, particularly if additional platelet transfusions are not carefully monitored.
2. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's liver dysfunction and ongoing metabolic derangements increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen her mental status and increase the risk of complications.
3. **Renal Failure:** The patient's ongoing anuria/oliguria and persistent renal failure increase the risk of further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
4. **Infection:** The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing use of antibiotics increase the risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
5. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's ongoing thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction increase the risk of coagulopathy, which can worsen bleeding and increase the risk of complications.
6. **Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's ongoing CVVH support and ongoing fluid and electrolyte imbalances increase the risk of complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal dysfunction and risk of aspiration increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
8. **Psychological Complications:** The patient's ongoing mental status changes and risk of delirium increase the risk of psychological complications, including anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and platelet count closely.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen to minimize the risk of antibiotic-associated bleeding.
3. Continue to optimize the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance to minimize the risk of complications.
4. Consider adjusting the patient's CVVH protocol to minimize the risk of bleeding and coagulopathy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider adjusting her anticonvulsant regimen as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a psychiatrist or psychologist to address her psychological needs.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and consider adjusting her nutrition regimen as needed.
8. Consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to address her ongoing gastrointestinal and liver dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- will change prednisone to solumedrole IV given poor liver function
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme (fibrinogen > 100 on
   [**12-19**], will defer cryo transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-21**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20
s w/o evidence of improvement in synthetic
   function.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a complex medical history, including EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is currently in the ICU and is being treated for thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, renal failure, anemia, and mental status changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and ongoing oozing from her NG tube pose a risk of bleeding, which could worsen her condition.
2. Infection: The patient has had multiple positive blood cultures and has been treated with antibiotics, but she is still at risk of developing sepsis or other infections.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is likely to require dialysis in the future. However, her hypotension and bleeding risk make it challenging to initiate dialysis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen her mental status and increase her risk of bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and ARF make her at risk of developing respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia make her at risk of developing cardiovascular instability, which could worsen her condition.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor appetite and malnutrition make her at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her condition.
8. Infection control: The patient has had multiple lines and tubes inserted, which increases her risk of developing infections.
9. Psychiatric complications: The patient's mental status changes and history of schizophrenia/psychosis make her at risk of developing psychiatric complications, such as delirium or psychosis.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and managed by a multidisciplinary team, including intensivists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, and psychiatrists."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old homeless female with a history of EtOH-cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and septic shock, complicated by ARDS and ARF. She remains anuric and requires CVVH. The patient has profound thrombocytopenia, refractory to platelet transfusion, likely secondary to portal hypertension, DIC, and possibly ITP. She has a critical condition, with multiple organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhage: Due to thrombocytopenia, the patient is at risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing bacteremia and UTI, which could lead to further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. ARDS: The patient has established ARDS, which may progress or worsen with continued lung injury.
4. ARF: The patient remains anuric and requires CVVH, which may not be sufficient to manage her renal dysfunction.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and liver dysfunction may lead to further encephalopathy, which could worsen her mental status.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing bacteremia increase her risk of developing additional infections.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications or worsening of her liver dysfunction.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, particularly if her ARDS or ARF progresses.
9. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and need for pressor support, may worsen, leading to cardiovascular collapse.
10. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's portal hypertension and cirrhosis may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of varices.

These complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's critical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old homeless female with cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and septic shock, complicated by ARDS and ARF. She is extubated, but still anuric and requiring CVVH. The patient is reliant on midodrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple organ dysfunction, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial etiology, including DIC, ESLD, and possibly ITP. No evidence of TTP.
2. Coagulopathy: with a prolonged PT and PTT, and low fibrinogen levels.
3. Hepatic dysfunction: with elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes.
4. Renal dysfunction: with acute kidney injury (ARF) and anuria.
5. Cardiovascular instability: with hypotension and the need for vasopressors.
6. Respiratory failure: with ARDS and the need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Neurological dysfunction: with altered mental status likely secondary to encephalopathy and probable ICU delirium.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding: due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
2. Infection: due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines and catheters.
3. Cardiovascular instability: with the risk of cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: with the potential for worsening ARF and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
5. Respiratory failure: with the risk of respiratory arrest and the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Neurological deterioration: with the potential for further encephalopathy and ICU delirium.
7. GI bleeding: due to the patient's cirrhosis and the presence of varices.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Supportive care with transfusions, antibiotics, and vasopressors.
2. Management of coagulopathy with cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions.
3. Management of renal dysfunction with CVVH and CRRT.
4. Management of cardiovascular instability with vasopressors and inotropes.
5. Management of respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation and bronchodilators.
6. Management of neurological dysfunction with lactulose and sedation.
7. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's disposition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration and optimize her chances of survival."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old homeless female with a history of EtOH-cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and septic shock, complicated by ARDS and ARF. She is currently extubated but still anuric and requires CVVH. The patient has profound thrombocytopenia refractory to platelet transfusion, likely due to a multifactorial etiology including DIC, ESLD, and perhaps ITP.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 90 bpm
* Blood pressure: 93/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths/min
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Central venous pressure: 9 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 10 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 8.0
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin: 20.3%
* Albumin: 2.1 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.1 mmol/L

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Thrombocytopenia management: administering cryoprecipitate to keep fibrinogen > 150, changing prednisone to methylprednisolone equivalent, and avoiding further platelet transfusion unless actively bleeding
* Calcium management: keeping iCa in the normal range
* Transfusion: transfusing PRBC to keep Hct > 21%
* GI management: supportive care with rifaximin and lactulose, no indication for SBP prophylaxis, and considering diagnostic paracentesis to exclude SBP
* Renal management: continuing CVVH for indication volume overload state
* CV management: goal MAPs > 50, on midodrine, and discussing role of albumin
* Resp management: remaining on RA and needing MIE
* ID management: unknown
* Endo management: unknown
* Neuro management: mildly encephalopathic, likely due to combination of ESLD and ICU delirium

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further decline in platelet count and bleeding risk
* Development of liver failure or worsening of ESLD
* Progression of ARF to ATN or overlap of HRS
* Increased risk of sepsis and septic shock
* Development of respiratory failure or worsening of ARDS
* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Development of neurological complications or worsening of encephalopathy
* Increased risk of bleeding or hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the management plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   overnight
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-20**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-20**] in the pm)
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20
s w/o evidence of improvement in synthetic
   function.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol hepatitis and cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, ARDS, and ARF, and was intubated on pressors. She is now extubated, but still dependent on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is hypotensive. She has worsening thrombocytopenia, likely due to poor production, medication effects, and possibly consumption/DIC. She is also experiencing hypotension, which is attributed to septic shock, and has a history of fever, which has resolved. She has renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and has not been able to tolerate hemodialysis (HD). Her mental status is altered, and she has a history of schizophrenia/psychosis. She has anemia, which is stable, and is being treated with epogen and transfusions. She has alcoholic hepatitis with cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus, and hepatitis serologies negative.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and possible DIC.
2. Worsening hypotension and shock, potentially leading to organ failure.
3. Renal failure progression, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Infection, potentially due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy, potentially leading to coma or death.
6. Anemia worsening, potentially leading to cardiac complications.
7. Alcoholic hepatitis progression, potentially leading to liver failure and death.
8. Neurological complications, potentially due to toxic/metabolic derangements and ICU delirium.
9. Respiratory failure, potentially due to ARDS and hypotension.
10. Cardiac complications, potentially due to hypotension and anemia.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding status closely, and consider transfusions if necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with vasopressors and fluid management, and consider adjusting the dose of vasopressors based on the patient's response.
3. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with CRRT, and consider transitioning to HD if the patient's blood pressure allows.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status closely, and consider adjusting her medications and therapy as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with epogen and transfusions, and consider adjusting the dose of epogen based on the patient's response.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation studies closely, and consider adjusting her medications and therapy as needed.
7. Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center, given her history of cirrhosis and liver failure.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and consider adjusting her medications and therapy as needed.
9. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist, given her history of anemia and potential cardiac complications.
10. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist, given her history of ARDS and potential respiratory complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- will change prednisone to solumedrole IV given poor liver function
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme (fibrinogen > 100 on
   [**12-19**], will defer cryo transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-21**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20
s w/o evidence of improvement in synthetic
   function.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- will change prednisone to solumedrole IV given poor liver function
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme (fibrinogen > 100 on
   [**12-19**], will defer cryo transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-21**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.

   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)

   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP

Based on the 24-hour events and the patient's overall condition, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, and she is at risk of bleeding. The patient is on CVVH, which can further exacerbate thrombocytopenia. The patient's liver function is also impaired, which can affect platelet production.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and she is at risk of developing hypovolemic shock. The patient is on CVVH, which can affect her blood pressure.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but she is at risk of developing hypothermia due to her hypotension and the cold environment of the ICU.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient is on CVVH, which can further exacerbate her renal failure.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is at risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is on lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but she is at risk of developing further anemia due to her ongoing bleeding and impaired liver function.
7. Infectious complications: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to her impaired immune system and her presence in the ICU.
8. Cerebral edema: The patient's brain is at risk of swelling due to her impaired liver function and her ongoing bleeding.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is impaired, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure due to her ongoing bleeding and her impaired liver function.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- will change prednisone to solumedrole IV given poor liver function
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme (fibrinogen > 100 on
   [**12-19**], will defer cryo transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-21**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20
s w/o evidence of improvement in synthetic
   function.

Based on the 24-hour events and the patient's medical history, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 7, which is a significant decrease from the normal range. This could lead to bleeding complications, and the patient is at risk for bleeding due to her poor liver function, medication effects, and possible consumption/DIC.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 92/51 mmHg, which is a significant decrease from the normal range. This could lead to organ dysfunction and failure, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but she is at risk for developing a new infection, particularly given her compromised immune system and the presence of a central line.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating significant renal impairment. This could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, and she is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.3 g/dL, indicating significant anemia. This could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive NG residuals and bloody excoriations on her mucous membranes suggest that she may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications.
8. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and the presence of a central line make her at risk for developing a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, but she may be at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her compromised lung function and the presence of ARDS.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and slurred speech suggest that she may be at risk for developing neurological complications, such as seizures or coma.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis, admitted with MSSA bacteremia, sepsis, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient has profound thrombocytopenia, and his platelet count is currently 7.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure ranging from 84/44 mmHg to 99/53 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is receiving calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and insulin infusions as part of his CRRT treatment.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.4, hemoglobin of 6.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 7. His liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 133 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 67 IU/L. His coagulation studies are abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 24.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 51.0 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.4.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding: Due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, the patient is at risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and sepsis, and is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and invasive procedures.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute tubular necrosis and is receiving CRRT, which may not be effective in correcting his renal function.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient has ESLD and is at risk of developing further liver damage, particularly in the setting of ongoing sepsis and coagulopathy.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is at risk of developing further respiratory failure, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and invasive procedures.
6. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk of developing further cardiac damage, particularly in the setting of ongoing sepsis and coagulopathy.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue CRRT to manage the patient's acute tubular necrosis and fluid overload.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and coagulation studies to assess the effectiveness of his thrombocytopenia treatment.
3. Continue supportive care for the patient's liver disease, including lactulose and rifaximin therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide supportive care, including medications to manage hypertension and cardiac failure.
6. Consider the use of anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombosis and bleeding.
7. Consider the use of antibiotics to prevent further infections, particularly in the setting of ongoing sepsis and coagulopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again

   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- at some point, will need to give CVVH holiday and attempt HD
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been intubated and extubated, and is currently on CVVH therapy. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple organ dysfunction, including thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, renal failure, anemia, and mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of septic shock and positive blood cultures may increase the risk of recurrent sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's persistent anuria/oliguria may indicate a poor prognosis for renal recovery.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver dysfunction may worsen, leading to increased risk of bleeding, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and history of septic shock may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability and arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased risk of respiratory arrest and death.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status changes and history of schizophrenia/psychosis may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
8. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of infections may increase the risk of new infections, such as pneumonia or UTI.
9. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as GI bleeding or bleeding from the lungs.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and history of septic shock may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- ask renal about giving CVVH holiday and possibly attempting HD today
   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice
   chips [**12-20**]
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20
s w/o evidence of improvement in synthetic
   function.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- ask renal about giving CVVH holiday and possibly attempting HD today
   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice
   chips [**12-20**]
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP

* Liver function tests (LFTs): 21.7% (bilirubin), 86/146 (ALT/AST)
* Coagulation studies: 26.0/47.9/2.6 (PT/PTT/INR)

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production, medication effect, and possible consumption/DIC.
2. Hypotension: may be due to septic shock, prior infections, or medication side effects.
3. Fever: resolved, but may be due to aspiration, transient bacteremia, or other sources.
4. Renal failure: likely ATN in setting of shock, with persistent anuria/oliguria.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: may be due to toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, or schizophrenia/psychosis.
6. Alcoholic hepatitis: with cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus, and grave prognosis.
7. Anemia: stable, but may require transfusion to maintain hemoglobin levels.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
2. Worsening of renal failure
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock
4. Progression of liver failure
5. Anemia or bleeding due to blood loss
6. Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension
7. Respiratory failure due to ARDS or pneumonia
8. Neurological deterioration due to encephalopathy or other causes
9. Infection due to indwelling lines or catheters
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to cirrhosis or other causes

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initally admitted with acute alcholic hepatits.  Course
   has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for 3-4 days per heme.  Reserving
   platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding.
     -Transfuse PRBC for crit<21
   Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  BP's marginal today after negative
   fluid balance yesterday.
     -Will discuss with renal about possibility of a CVVH holiday and
   attempt at HD in near future
   Hypotension: BP's marginal but tolerating fluid removal over the last
   36 hours.  No signs of infection at present
     -Continue midodrine
   Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
   GOC:  Will continue ongoing discussions with family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has been on steroids for concern of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and his platelet count has remained low. He has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is being transfused for critical levels of <21. The patient's renal function remains anuric, and his blood pressure is marginal due to negative fluid balance.

The patient's physical examination reveals icteric sclera, poor dentition, and distended abdomen. His respiratory status has improved, but he is still at risk for aspiration. His neurologic examination shows him to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to stimuli.

Laboratory results show the patient's platelet count is 13 K/uL, and his creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 114-131 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia, which can lead to hemorrhage, hematoma, or other bleeding-related complications.
2. Renal failure progression, which can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infections.
3. Respiratory failure, which can lead to increased risk of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other respiratory complications.
4. Encephalopathy, which can lead to increased risk of seizures, coma, and death.
5. Infections, such as sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
6. Liver failure, which can lead to increased risk of bleeding, encephalopathy, and death.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued steroids for autoimmune thrombocytopenia, transfusion of PRBC for critical levels, and ongoing discussion with the renal team regarding the possibility of a CVVH holiday and attempt at hemodialysis in the near future. The patient's care plan also includes continued lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, cipro for SBP prophylaxis, and midodrine for hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure

   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for 3-4 days per heme.  Reserving
   platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding.
     -Transfuse PRBC for crit<21 although may need to rethink Hct
   threshold to allow HD without pressors. Possibly at 25-27. will recheck
   retic count and smear daily. ? candidacy for IVIG if steroid resistant
   Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  BP's marginal today after negative
   fluid balance yesterday.
     -Will discuss with renal about possibility of a CVVH holiday and
   attempt at HD in near future . would prefer to have Hct higher prior to
   HD.
   Hypotension: BP's marginal but tolerating fluid removal over the last
   36 hours.  No signs of infection at present
     -Continue midodrine
   Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
   GOC:  Will continue ongoing discussions with family.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia. The patient has been on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia and has received 1 unit of PRBC (packed red blood cells) yesterday. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 78/40 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an SpO2 of 100% and ABG (arterial blood gas) results of 7.41/34/77/20/-1.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulants for CVVH.
2. Infection: The patient's anuric state and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the patient's lung function deteriorates further.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anuric state and use of CVVH may lead to further renal damage if not managed properly.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ESLD and use of lactulose and rifaximin may lead to worsening of hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and use of anticoagulants may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if the patient's blood volume is further reduced.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability may worsen if the patient's blood pressure drops further.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding status closely.
2. Continue steroids for autoimmune thrombocytopenia and transfuse PRBC as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider CVVH holiday and attempt at HD (hemodialysis) in near future.
4. Continue lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy and monitor for worsening of hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider adjusting ventilator settings as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adjusting vasopressors as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and consider adjusting inotropic support as needed.
8. Consider IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) if steroid-resistant thrombocytopenia develops."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- ask renal about giving CVVH holiday and possibly attempting HD today
   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add

   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo

   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again

   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, acute hepatic failure, and altered mental status. She was admitted to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been extubated and is currently receiving CVVH. Her current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 38.1°C (100.5°F), HR 94 bpm, BP 88/49 mmHg, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 16 mmHg, MAP 74 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total in 6,110 mL, total out 5,402 mL, with a net loss of 708 mL
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device none, SpO2 99%, ABG 7.42/32/91/20/-2
* Laboratory results: WBC 9.6, Hct 21.3, Plt 13, Cr 0.9, TCO2 23, Glucose 114, other labs as listed
* Imaging: No new imaging
* Microbiology: NGTD

Potential medical complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding. She is receiving IV solumedrol for possible ITP or AIHA, and her platelet count has shown a slight improvement.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for further hypotension. She is receiving midodrine 10 mg TID, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but she is at risk for further fever episodes. She is receiving rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and her liver function tests are being closely monitored.
4. Renal failure: The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria and is at risk for further renal dysfunction. She is receiving CVVH, and her renal function is being closely monitored.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but she is at risk for further anemia. She is receiving epogen per renal, and her hemoglobin level is being closely monitored.
6. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient has a grave prognosis due to her liver disease. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and her liver function tests are being closely monitored.
7. Mental status: The patient's mental status is waxing and waning, and she is at risk for further cognitive decline. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and her mental status is being closely monitored.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- ask renal about giving CVVH holiday and possibly attempting HD today
   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice

   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been extubated and is currently receiving CVVH therapy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 100.6°F (38.1°C)
* Blood Pressure: 88/49 mmHg
* Heart Rate: 94 bpm
* Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 16 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count 13 x 10^9/L
* Elevated liver enzymes: ALT 124 IU/L, AST 223 IU/L
* Coagulopathy: PT 26.9 seconds, PTT 50.3 seconds, INR 2.7
* Renal dysfunction: Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, BUN 20 mg/dL
* Electrolyte imbalance: Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia
* Anemia: Hemoglobin 7.3 g/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy put her at risk for bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of an infection.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction and elevated ammonia levels increase her risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria and anuria suggest the possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to septic shock, hypovolemia, or other causes.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of ARDS.
7. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient's liver dysfunction and cirrhosis increase her risk for complications related to alcohol use.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing CVVH therapy
* Monitoring for bleeding and coagulopathy
* Managing infection with antibiotics and other therapies
* Treating hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin
* Monitoring for renal failure and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Managing hypotension with vasopressors and fluids
* Monitoring for ARDS and adjusting therapy as necessary
* Managing alcoholic hepatitis with supportive care and monitoring liver function tests.

The patient's prognosis is grave, and she is at high risk for complications and mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
   - had a CVVH holiday, renal planning HD this week if BP tolerates
   - passed S/S eval (?!?) Wrote for a diet but still has her NGT with TFs
   going; tolerated a full tray this morning at breakfast.
   - had a low grade temp to 100.6, sent BCx
   - SBP dropped to 70, responded to 500cc bolus. Of note, NIBP much

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is extubated but still dependent on CVVH and has a history of thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, and anemia. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and she has portal vein thrombus and cirrhosis. Her prognosis is grave, and she is being treated with various medications, including solumedrol, epogen, and rifaximin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and possible ITP or AIHA increase the risk of bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and brewing infection increase the risk of sepsis and organ failure.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction and portal vein thrombus increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and need for CVVH increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and possible cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status, seizures, and possible ICU delirium increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, cerebral edema, and neurocognitive impairment.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's anemia, bleeding, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as GI bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ARDS, hypoxemia, and possible respiratory failure increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory acidosis, respiratory failure, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
9. Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and brewing infection increase the risk of SIRS, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and mortality.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets trending up today.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for now.  Reserving platelet transfusion
   for vigorous bleeding.
     -Transfuse PRBC today in an attempt to bolster hemodynamics. Will
   recheck retic count and smear daily. ? candidacy for IVIG if steroid
   resistant
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  BP's marginal today after negative
   fluid balance yesterday.  CVVH on hold for now
      -Assess hemodynamics and lytes daily and discuss with renal re:
   timing of HD trial.
   Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp overnight.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture is spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
   Hypotension: BP's marginal, as above will monitor to determine if/when
   she can tolerate an HD trial.
     -Continue midodrine
   Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
   Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
   FEN:  If tolerates feeding, will remove NGT.
   GOC:  Will continue ongoing discussions with family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
* Heart rate: 95 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 83/43 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), icteric sclera
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended
* Extremities: Right: 1+, Left: 1+
* Skin: Jaundiced
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to self

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 13 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mg/dL
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* LDH: 240 IU/L
* Calcium: 10.1 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Rifaximin
* Epogen
* Midodrine
* Lactulose
* Methylprednisolone
* Ciprofloxacin
* Metronidazole

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing methylprednisolone for thrombocytopenia
* Transfusing PRBC (packed red blood cells) to bolster hemodynamics
* Assessing hemodynamics and electrolytes daily and discussing with renal team for timing of HD (hemodialysis) trial
* Monitoring for leukocytosis and fungal sepsis
* Continuing lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy
* Continuing pulmonary toilet and monitoring for aspiration
* Replacing NGT (nasogastric tube) if tolerates feeding

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets trending up today.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for now.  Reserving platelet transfusion
   for vigorous bleeding.
     -Transfuse PRBC today in an attempt to bolster hemodynamics. Will
   recheck retic count and smear daily. ? candidacy for IVIG if steroid
   resistant
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  BP's marginal today after negative
   fluid balance yesterday.  CVVH on hold for now
      -Assess hemodynamics and lytes daily and discuss with renal re:
   timing of HD trial.
   Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp overnight.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture is spikes.
   Hypotension: BP's marginal, as above will monitor to determine if/when
   she can tolerate an HD trial.
     -Continue midodrine
   Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
   Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
   FEN:  If tolerates feeding, will remove NGT.
   GOC:  Will continue ongoing discussions with family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets trending up today.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for now.  Reserving platelet transfusion
   for vigorous bleeding.
     -Transfuse PRBC today in an attempt to bolster hemodynamics. Will
   recheck retic count and smear daily. ? candidacy for IVIG if steroid
   resistant
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  BP's marginal today after negative
   fluid balance yesterday.  CVVH on hold for now
      -Assess hemodynamics and lytes daily and discuss with renal re:
   timing of HD trial.
   Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp overnight.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture is spikes.
   Hypotension: BP's marginal, as above will monitor to determine if/when
   she can tolerate an HD trial.
     -Continue midodrine
   Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
   Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
   FEN:  If tolerates feeding, will remove NGT.
   GOC:  Will continue ongoing discussions with family.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. She has developed ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous venovenous hemofiltration), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
* Heart rate: 95 bpm (85-116 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 83/43 mmHg (59-98/74-58 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes and conjunctiva: PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), icteric sclera
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended
* Extremities: Right and left radial pulses not assessed, right and left digital pulses 1+
* Skin: Not assessed, jaundiced
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to self, movement and tone not assessed

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 13 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.8 mmol/L
* Chloride: 108 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 21.3 mmol/L
* Glucose: 114 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results: PT/PTT/INR 26.9/50.3/2.7, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 28/28/0.6, ALT/AST 124/223, Alk Phos/T Bili 78/23.7, Amylase/Lipase 41/41, differential neutrophils 80.0%, bands 2.0%, lymphocytes 9.0%, monocytes 8.0%, eosinophils 1.0%

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Renal failure requiring hemodialysis
* Respiratory failure requiring intubation
* Infection due to low-grade temperature and leukocytosis
* Hypotension due to marginal blood pressure
* Encephalopathy due to cirrhosis
* Aspiration due to increased risk of aspiration
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to cirrhosis

The plan of care includes:

* Continuing methylprednisolone for autoimmune thrombocytopenia
* Transfusing PRBC to bolster hemodynamics
* Assessing hemodynamics and electrolytes daily and discussing with renal team for timing of HD trial
* Continuing lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy
* Continuing pulmonary toilet and monitoring for aspiration
* Reassessing feeding tolerance and removing NGT if possible

   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to the ICU and has been receiving CVVH, pressors, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 81/44 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% and no need for oxygen therapy. The patient is tolerating a diet and has been extubated since December 4th.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is receiving a steroid trial for possible ITP or AIHA. Her platelet count is being monitored, and she is not being transfused additional platelets unless there is evidence of worsening bleeding.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is receiving midodrine to help improve it. She is being held on CVVH to try to work towards tolerating HD.
* Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, and she is no longer receiving antibiotics.
* Renal failure: The patient is still anuric and is being held on CVVH to try to raise her volume balance and attempt HD.
* Mental status: The patient's mental status is improving slowly, and she is tolerating a diet without difficulty. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and she is receiving epogen per renal.
* Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis on ultrasound, and her liver function tests are stable in the mid-20s.

Potential medical complications:

* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding complications, especially if she is not transfused additional platelets.
* Infection: The patient's anemia and renal failure make her more susceptible to infection.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are stable, but she has evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus, which could lead to further hepatic failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's anuria could lead to further renal failure and the need for dialysis.
* Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but she is still at risk for further changes due to her toxic and metabolic derangements.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and extubated, but remains CVVH-dependent and has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 81/44 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device in use.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.6-16.9 K/μL
* Hct: 21.7-26.9%
* Plt: 13-33 K/μL
* Cr: 0.6-1.8 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22-23 mmol/L
* Glucose: 115-131 mg/dL
* Other lab results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and mild liver dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive) on ultrasound, and negative hepatitis serologies.

The patient's medications include:

* Lansoprazole (Prevacid)
* Solumedrol IV for possible ITP or AIHA
* Midodrine for hypotension
* Cipro 250 mg QD for SBP PPX
* Epogen for anemia
* Rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, and the team is holding CVVH to try to work towards tolerating HD. The patient is currently on midodrine 10 mg TID, and the team will need to continue to monitor and adjust this medication.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and the team is considering a hematology consult to further evaluate the cause of this condition. The patient is currently on solumedrol IV for possible ITP or AIHA.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but the team will need to continue to monitor and adjust the patient's epogen dose as needed.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction is severe, and the team is concerned about the patient's mental status. The patient is currently on lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and the team will need to continue to monitor and adjust this treatment as needed.
5. Renal failure: The patient is still anuric, and the team is holding CVVH in an attempt to raise volume balance and attempt HD. The patient will need to continue to be closely monitored and adjusted as needed.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and the team will need to continue to closely monitor and adjust the patient's treatment as needed to address these potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for now.  Reserving platelet transfusion
   for vigorous bleeding.  When platelets above 50k will transition to
   prednisone
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Tolerated HD yesterday although no
   volume removed.
     -Plan for HD attempt tomorrow with small voume removal.
    Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp 2 nights ago.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
     -Will try to place peripherals in attempt to remove CVC.
    Hypotension: Tolerated HD yesterday.
     -Continue midodrine
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by ARF (Acute Renal Failure) requiring CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 102 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 89/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP (Central Venous Pressure) 5 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC (White Blood Cell Count): 9.6-16.9 K/uL
* Hct (Hematocrit): 21.7-26.9%
* Plt (Platelet Count): 13-33 K/uL
* Cr (Creatinine): 0.9-1.8 mg/dL
* TCO2 (Total Carbon Dioxide): 23-21 mmHg
* Glucose: 124-127 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 27.3/49.5/2.7, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 28//, ALT/AST: 146/203, Alk Phos/T Bili: 87/27.2, Amylase/Lipase: /41, Differential-Neuts: 82.0%, Band: 2.0%, Lymph: 5.0%, Mono: 7.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Fibrinogen: 156 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 2.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.0 g/dL, LDH: 240 IU/L, Ca++: 9.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing methylprednisolone for thrombocytopenia
* Reserving platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding
* Planning for HD (Hemodialysis) attempt tomorrow with small volume removal
* Continuing to monitor for leukocytosis and potential fungal sepsis
* Continuing midodrine for hypotension
* Continuing lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy
* On cipro for SBP (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis) prophylaxis
* Continuing pulmonary toilet
* Regular diet
* Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Prophylaxis for DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis), stress ulcer, and VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Fungal sepsis due to high risk of fungal infections
* Respiratory failure due to increased risk of aspiration
* Encephalopathy due to liver disease
* Hypotension due to liver disease and potential sepsis
* Infection due to prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppression
* Renal failure due to continued anuria
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension and liver disease"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for now.  Reserving platelet transfusion
   for vigorous bleeding.  When platelets above 50k will transition to
   prednisone
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Tolerated HD yesterday although no
   volume removed.
     -Plan for HD attempt tomorrow with small voume removal.
    Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp 2 nights ago.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
     -Will try to place peripherals or PICC in attempt to remove CVC.
    Hypotension: Tolerated HD yesterday.
     -Continue midodrine
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrol IV for ITP; continues to improve slightly each day,
   so will plan to continue for now
   -- f/u add
l heme recs; will check retic count
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: has been improved; remains on midodrine; tolerated HD
   w/o vol removal [**12-22**]
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: no further fever, despite being on solumedrol and off
   antibiotics
   -- cont to follow; no need for empiric abx currently
   # Renal failure: still anuric; holding CVVH in an attempt to raise
   volume balance and attempt HD
   -- tolerated HD [**12-22**] without any volume removal
   -- wiill need to try to remove volume next attempt ( today)
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy;
   -- improving slowly, tolerating diet w/o difficulty
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   -- increased epogen dose 1/22
   -- transfused two units RBC on [**2123-12-22**]  to increase oncotic pressure in
   hopes of tolerating HD
   --  maintain active t+s
   -- solumedrol for ? autoimmune hemolytic anmia
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the hospital with acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was intubated and on pressors, but is now extubated and off pressors. She remains CVVH dependent and is tolerating low blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 13, and she is receiving a steroid trial for possible ITP or AIHA.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, but she is tolerating midodrine and has been able to hold CVVH without volume removal.
* Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, and she is no longer receiving antibiotics.
* Renal failure: The patient remains anuric and is holding CVVH in an attempt to raise her volume balance and attempt HD.
* Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but she is still experiencing toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, and possibly schizophrenia/psychosis.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and she has been transfused with two units of RBC to increase her oncotic pressure.
* Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive) on ultrasound, and her liver function tests are stable in the mid-20s.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and possible ITP or AIHA may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of CVL tip may increase her risk of infection.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are stable, but she may still be at risk for liver failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's anuria and need for CVVH may indicate worsening renal failure.
* Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of CVL tip may increase her risk of sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver disease and portal vein thrombus may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on this information, the patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing steroid trial for possible ITP or AIHA
* Monitoring for bleeding and transfusing platelets only if necessary
* Continuing midodrine to support blood pressure
* Attempting to remove volume during next HD session
* Continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Monitoring for signs of liver failure and sepsis
* Continuing to follow up on laboratory results and adjusting treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- change solumedrol to prednisone; can likely taper if plts continue
   to rise and stabilize
   -- f/u add
l heme recs; will check retic count
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: has been improved; remains on midodrine; tolerated HD
   w/o vol removal [**12-22**]
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: no further fever, despite being on solumedrol and off
   antibiotics
   -- cont to follow; no need for empiric abx currently
   # Renal failure: still anuric; holding CVVH in an attempt to raise
   volume balance and attempt HD
   -- tolerated HD [**12-22**] without any volume removal
   -- wiill need to try to remove volume next attempt ( today)
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy;
   -- improving slowly, tolerating diet w/o difficulty
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb

   -- increased epogen dose 1/22
   -- transfused two units RBC on [**2123-12-22**]  to increase oncotic pressure in

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Will change steroids to prednisone 60mg daily today and taper ( ?
   steroids contributing to delirium)
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Tolerated HD Wednesday although no
   volume removed.
     -Plan for HD attempt today with voume removal.
    Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp 3 nights ago.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
     -Check CXR today
     -CVC now out, will try to have IR guided PICC placed today.
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -Continue midodrine. PICC line today for pressor need with HD
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent
   disorientation
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
     -CXR does not features of PNA or atelectasis
    FEN:  Regular diet
   Dispo:  If tolerates HD with fluid removal, will consider floor
   transfer tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, and they are on a regular diet.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.6-16.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 13-52 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-3.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21-26.5 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range
* Liver function tests: mildly elevated
* Amylase and lipase: within normal range

The patient's imaging studies show no new findings.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial, currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and platelets are trending up.
* Renal failure: remains anuric, tolerated HD on Wednesday, and will attempt HD today with volume removal.
* Leukocytosis: possibly related to steroids, and will continue to monitor, culture if spikes, and check CXR today.
* Hypotension: BP is the best it has been today, and will continue midodrine and attempt to place a PICC line today.
* Cirrhosis: will continue lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy and cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
* Pulmonary: will continue pulmonary toilet and CXR does not feature any signs of pneumonia or atelectasis.
* Fluid and electrolyte management: will continue to monitor and adjust as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.
* Fungal sepsis: high risk due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.
* Acute kidney injury: due to the patient's ongoing renal failure and the need for HD.
* Respiratory failure: due to the patient's ongoing respiratory failure and the need for intubation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: due to the patient's cirrhosis and the presence of thrombocytopenia.
* Delirium: due to the patient's underlying liver disease and the presence of steroids.
* Infection: due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications early on and adjust the plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Will change steroids to prednisone 60mg daily today
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Tolerated HD Wednesday although no
   volume removed.
     -Plan for HD attempt today with voume removal.
    Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp 3 nights ago.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
     -Check CXR today
     -CVC now out, will try to have IR guided PICC placed today.
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -Continue midodrine
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
     -Check CXR today given rhonchi
    FEN:  Regular diet
   Dispo:  If tolerates HD with fluid removal, will consider floor
   transfer tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute kidney injury (ARF), respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a SpO2 of 99%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is -2 mmHg, and his fluid balance is 1,140 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 13 K/uL, and he is being treated with steroids for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL, and he is receiving hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 236 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 176 IU/L.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a PaO2 of 109 mmHg and a PaCO2 of 21 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and is on a regular diet.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
2. Renal failure requiring further hemodialysis
3. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of central venous catheters
4. Liver failure leading to encephalopathy and worsening of his condition
5. Respiratory failure requiring further mechanical ventilation
6. Hypotension requiring further treatment with vasopressors
7. Fungal sepsis due to prolonged use of antibiotics and steroids
8. Aspiration pneumonia due to his respiratory status and risk of aspiration

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of his platelet count and adjusting his steroid dosage as needed
2. Continued hemodialysis and monitoring of his renal function
3. Antibiotic treatment for potential infections
4. Monitoring of his liver function and adjusting his lactulose and rifaximin dosage as needed
5. Pulmonary toilet and monitoring of his respiratory status
6. Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
7. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)"

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and on pressors, but has since been extubated and is now on CVVH. The patient has thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, renal failure, anemia, and alcoholic hepatitis. She is being managed with various medications, including steroids, antibiotics, and diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma. Close monitoring of platelet counts and bleeding risk is necessary.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and coma. Monitoring of liver function tests and ammonia levels is necessary.
3. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infections, particularly sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies is necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anuric state and ongoing CVVH therapy increase the risk of renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function is necessary.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's liver dysfunction and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms and laboratory results is necessary.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, or stroke. Close monitoring of neurological symptoms and laboratory results is necessary.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's liver dysfunction and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, or hyponatremia. Close monitoring of laboratory results and medication management is necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, and shock. She has been intubated and is now extubated, but still dependent on CVVH due to acute renal failure. She has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, and anemia, and has been treated with various medications, including steroids, pressors, and antibiotics. Her mental status has been improving slowly, but she remains at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she has been experiencing bleeding. Further bleeding episodes could occur if her platelet count does not improve.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for developing infections, particularly in the ICU setting.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is dependent on CVVH. Further deterioration of her renal function could occur if she does not respond to treatment.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, which could worsen her mental status and overall condition.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but further anemia could occur if she does not respond to treatment.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for further hypotension, which could worsen her condition.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for developing infections, particularly in the ICU setting.
8. Sepsis: The patient has a history of liver disease and is at risk for developing sepsis, particularly in the ICU setting.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding status, and consider transfusing platelets if necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Consider administering lactulose and rifaximin to prevent further hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider administering antibiotics if the patient develops a fever or other signs of infection.
8. Consider administering pressors if the patient's blood pressure does not improve with other treatments."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA;
   plt count has been improving on steroids.  No evidence of bleeding.
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated on pressors but is now extubated and on CVVH. Her thrombocytopenia is likely multifactorial, and she is receiving steroid therapy. Her hepatic dysfunction is not correctable, and she has been stabilized on prednisone 60 mg QD. She has also been experiencing hypotension, which has improved with midodrine, and is still anuric. She is receiving epo and starting renagel for renal failure. Her mental status is improving daily but is expected to be slow to recover due to toxic and metabolic derangements. She has anemia, which is stable, and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia is a risk factor for bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Infection: The patient's anuric state and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing anuria and need for CVVH indicate a high risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic dysfunction and use of lactulose and rifaximin increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to coma and death.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and need for CVVH increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and need for pressors increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and risk of hepatic encephalopathy increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and coma.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for these potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Continue prednisone at 60mg for now, with plans to taper over the
   next several weeks.
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Currently getting HD with volume
   removal and has tolerated from BP standpoint.
     -Continue epogen.  Start renagel
     -Will plan for tunnelled line next week
    Leukocytosis:   Improved today.  Likely from steroids.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -If continues to tolerate HD, could consider weaning midodrine in the
   future.
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent
   disorientation
    Pulm:  Status much improved but still at overall increased risk of
   aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
    FEN:  Regular diet
   Dispo:  If tolerates HD with fluid removal, will consider floor
   transfer today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.

    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Currently getting HD with volume
   removal and has tolerated from BP standpoint.
     -Continue epogen.  Start renagel
     -Will plan for tunnelled line next week
    Leukocytosis:   Improved today.  Likely from steroids.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -If continues to tolerate HD, could consider weaning midodrine in the
   future.
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent
   disorientation
    Pulm:  Status much improved but still at overall increased risk of

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute kidney injury (ARF) requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 95 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* White blood cell count: 13.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 65 K/uL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 214/272 IU/L)
* Elevated bilirubin (3.8 mg/dL)
* Elevated creatinine (3.0 mg/dL)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: 240 IU/L)
* Elevated calcium (9.3 mg/dL)
* Elevated magnesium (2.8 mg/dL)
* Elevated phosphorus (6.8 mg/dL)
* Low albumin (2.0 g/dL)
* Elevated lactic acid (2.0 mmol/L)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* No new imaging studies performed

The patient's microbiology results show:

* No new microorganisms isolated

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Thrombocytopenia: Continue prednisone at 60mg for now, with plans to taper over the next several weeks.
* Renal failure: Continue hemodialysis with volume removal and consider weaning midodrine in the future.
* Leukocytosis: Continue to monitor and consider culturing if spikes.
* Hypotension: Continue to monitor and consider weaning midodrine if BP remains stable.
* Cirrhosis: Continue lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, and continue ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.
* Pulmonary: Continue pulmonary toilet and monitor for signs of aspiration.
* Nutrition: Continue regular diet.
* Disposition: Consider transfer to floor if patient tolerates hemodialysis with fluid removal.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to immunosuppression
* Respiratory failure due to aspiration
* Renal failure due to inadequate dialysis
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to inadequate treatment
* Sepsis due to fungal or bacterial infections
* Malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition
* Fluid overload due to inadequate dialysis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Continue prednisone at 60mg for now, with plans to taper over the
   next several weeks.
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Currently getting HD with volume
   removal and has tolerated from BP standpoint.
     -Continue epogen.  Start renagel
     -Will plan for tunnelled line next week
    Leukocytosis:   Improved today.  Likely from steroids.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -If continues to tolerate HD, could consider weaning midodrine in the
   future.
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent
   disorientation
    Pulm:  Status much improved but still at overall increased risk of
   aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
    FEN:  Regular diet
   Dispo:  If tolerates HD with fluid removal, will consider floor
   transfer today.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient, a 45-year-old male with ESLD, is currently in the ICU due to complications from acute alcoholic hepatitis, including ARF, respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been on CVVH, intubated, and receiving epogen for anemia. His platelet count has been trending up, and he is currently on steroids for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 95 bpm (83-97)
* Blood pressure: 103/62 mmHg (80-128/73-95)
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths/min (16-23)
* SpO2: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes/Conjunctiva: PERRL, sclera icteric
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory/Chest: Crackles in the bases bilaterally, diminished breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, distended
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 16.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 65 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Other lab results: see below

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to ESLD and cirrhosis
* Respiratory failure due to ARF and aspiration
* Renal failure due to ARF and inadequate fluid removal
* Fungal sepsis due to high risk of fungal colonization
* Malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition and prolonged hospitalization

Based on the patient's current status, the plan is to continue prednisone for autoimmune thrombocytopenia, epogen for anemia, and lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy. The patient will also continue to receive CVVH and HD, and will be monitored for signs of bleeding, infection, and other complications."
