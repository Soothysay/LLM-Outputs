 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurances).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis.
   - Continue vent at current settings overnight.
   - Would strongly consider more definitive airway management to both
   prevent further tracheal injury with repeated intubations, and bypass
   stenosed area if NPPE playing a role.  Will discuss tomorrow with
   ENT/[**Doctor Last Name 4311**] and IP/[**Doctor Last Name 4950**].  Will keep NPO in case able to do tomorrow.
   - Try to obtain further information re: enzyme or ECG changes with
   acute episodes; also obtain recent cath if any (from St Vincents) and
   recent stress (from PCP) and recent TTE (from [**Hospital1 4942**]).
   - CXR now to eval tube placement.
   - ECG and check cardiac enzymes.  Check BNP.
   - Consider Aline if prolonged intubation or attempting to manage
   without trach.
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - CXR.
   - Check BNP.
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patinet and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket.
   - Hold on specific abx treatment for now.
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - Ceftriaxone for now.  Resend UA and culture.  Consider broadening as
   has been in hospital a lot recently.
   - Check with OSH tomorrow re: culture update.
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain TTE results if really was performed today at OSH.
   - BB.  Hold ACE given ?allergy as above.
   - Lasix 40 IV BID for now, goal 1L neg in next 24 hours.  Mildly volume
   up.
   - Check BNP and CXR.
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - Statin.
   - ASA for now ?need to hold for trach.
   - Obtain cath, echo, stress reports as above.
   .
   # Afib.  Currently mostly A paced on tele.  Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on AC for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as abov.e
   - Clarify AC plans.
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.
   - Ativan prn for now.
   - Risk for BZ withdrawal if held; watch for signs.
   - Continue citalopram.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic heart failure (CHF), and tracheal stenosis. She has been admitted to the ICU due to recurrent acute pulmonary edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone multiple reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema. The etiology of acute pulmonary edema is not entirely clear, but it may be related to negative pressure edema, acute ischemic heart disease, or other factors.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest or death.
2. Tracheal injury: The patient's repeated intubations may cause tracheal injury, which could lead to bleeding, stenosis, or other complications.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's acute pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, cardiac compromise, or other complications.
4. Heart failure: The patient's systolic CHF may worsen, leading to cardiac decompensation, arrhythmias, or other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's UTI and potential bacteremia could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery, fatigue, or other complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
8. Pacer pocket pain/swelling: The patient's pacer pocket pain/swelling may worsen, leading to infection, bleeding, or other complications.
9. Angioedema: The patient's history of angioedema could lead to life-threatening allergic reactions.
10. Anxiety and depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress, decreased cooperation with treatment, or other complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue vent support at current settings overnight.
2. Consider more definitive airway management, such as tracheostomy, to prevent further tracheal injury and improve respiratory support.
3. Obtain further information regarding enzyme or ECG changes with acute episodes, recent catheterization, and recent stress tests.
4. Check BNP, CXR, and cardiac enzymes to evaluate cardiac function and potential complications.
5. Consider aline if prolonged intubation or attempting to manage without trach.
6. Manage pain, anxiety, and depression with appropriate medications and therapies.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte balance and correct any imbalances promptly.
8. Consider prophylactic antibiotics for potential infections.
9. Continuously reassess the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and neurological status to ensure timely interventions and optimize outcomes."

   # Respiratory failure.  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis.
   - Continue vent at current settings overnight.
   - Would strongly consider more definitive airway management to both

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic respiratory failure, coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and tracheal stenosis. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema of unclear etiology. The patient's recent medical history includes multiple reintubations, and her trachea has been decannulated. She has a history of anxiety and depression, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tracheal injury: The patient's repeated intubations may cause further damage to her trachea, leading to prolonged respiratory failure and potential need for tracheostomy.
2. Negative pressure pulmonary edema: The patient's tracheal stenosis may be contributing to negative pressure pulmonary edema, which can worsen her respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and systolic heart failure may lead to cardiac complications, such as acute ischemic heart disease, diastolic dysfunction, or arrhythmias.
4. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance is mildly positive, which may lead to volume overload and worsening of her respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, and her prolonged hospitalization may increase her risk of developing other infections.
6. Tracheostomy complications: If a tracheostomy is performed, the patient may be at risk for complications such as bleeding, infection, or tracheal stenosis.
7. Anxiety and depression: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen her respiratory distress and other medical complications, and may require further management.
8. Medication interactions: The patient's complex medication regimen may lead to interactions or adverse effects, which need to be closely monitored.
9. Pacer pocket pain and swelling: The patient's pacer pocket pain and swelling may indicate an abscess or other infection, which needs to be evaluated and treated promptly.
10. UTI treatment: The patient's UTI needs to be thoroughly evaluated and treated, and the patient may require further antibiotics or other treatments."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   68 yo women with h/o COPD, CAD, diastolic CHF, h/o trach for 1 year
   after hip replacement surgery, tracheal fistula, residual tracheal
   stenosis.  Had PEA arrest at home, intubated, treated for CHF and PNA
   at [**Hospital3 **], she was extubated, reintubated.  Transferred
   here and admitted to thoracics in [**Month (only) 1033**] - had bronch with tracheal
   stenosis that was dilated.  Was extubated.  Went to rehab, where she
   had respiratory distress, PEA arrest, went to OSH - had AICD placed.
   ?Cardiac cath.  Gets anxious, HTNsive, and intubated.  Went home
   eventually.  Where she was home for 1/2 hour, got anxious, SOB,
   reintubated in the field.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   68 yo women with h/o COPD, CAD, diastolic CHF, h/o trach for 1 year
   after hip replacement surgery, tracheal fistula, residual tracheal
   stenosis.  Had PEA arrest at home, intubated, treated for CHF and PNA
   at [**Hospital3 **], she was extubated, reintubated.  Transferred
   here and admitted to thoracics in [**Month (only) 1033**] - had bronch with tracheal
   stenosis that was dilated.  Was extubated.  Went to rehab, where she
   had respiratory distress, PEA arrest, went to OSH - had AICD placed.
   ?Cardiac cath.  Gets anxious, HTNsive, and intubated.  Went home
   eventually.  Where she was home for 1/2 hour, got anxious, SOB,
   reintubated in the field.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), tracheal fistula, and residual tracheal stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is likely caused by negative pressure pulmonary edema, tracheal stenosis, and/or anxiety. She has a history of cardiac catheterization and has undergone cardiac arrest and intubation multiple times. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/53 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of tracheal fistula and residual tracheal stenosis, she is at high risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac catheterization and cardiac arrest increases her risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and she may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and respiratory failure increases her risk for developing neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Renal failure: The patient's history of diuretic therapy and fluid overload increases her risk for developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Infection: The patient's history of tracheal fistula and residual tracheal stenosis increases her risk for developing infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

In summary, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation, may be necessary to improve her respiratory status."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   # Hypernatremia: likely [**2-23**] dehydration.
   - PO challenge today
   - if fails, will give IVF
   - PM lytes
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis. Now s/p trach placement.
   - currently on PS 8 PEEP 5 FiO2 60% -> will wean PS and FiO2 then to
   trach collar
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - Lasix PRN
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patient and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket shows no abscess
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - continue Ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cx
   - check with OSH re: culture
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain OSH TTE
   - continue BB.  Hold ACE given ? allergy as above.
   - continue Lasix 40 IV
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - continue Statin.
   - restart ASA  (was held for trach placement)
   - Obtain OSH cath, echo, stress reports as above
   .
   # Afib. Currently mostly A paced on tele. Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on anticoagulation for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as above
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.
   - continue citalopram
   - Ativan prn for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic heart failure (CHF), and tracheal stenosis, who presented with recurrent acute pulmonary edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure. She was recently decannulated and had multiple reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of anxiety and depression, and is taking medications for pain, anxiety, and CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to her underlying COPD and tracheal stenosis.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient's acute pulmonary edema is likely due to a combination of factors, including negative pressure edema, acute ischemic heart disease, and anxiety. Further management is needed to address this condition.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to dehydration, and further hydration is needed to correct this electrolyte imbalance.
4. Tracheal Stenosis: The patient's tracheal stenosis is a significant concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of the stenosis and its impact on her respiratory function.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's CAD and CHF put her at risk for cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. Anxiety and Depression: The patient's anxiety and depression are significant concerns, and further management is needed to address these conditions and prevent further respiratory distress.
7. Pacer Pocket Pain/Swelling: The patient's pacer pocket pain/swelling is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this condition and its impact on her overall health.
8. UTI: The patient's UTI is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this infection and its impact on her overall health.
9. Systolic CHF: The patient's systolic CHF is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this condition and its impact on her overall health.
10. CAD: The patient's CAD is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of this condition and its impact on her overall health."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis.
   - Continue vent at current settings overnight.
   - Would strongly consider more definitive airway management to both
   prevent further tracheal injury with repeated intubations, and bypass
   stenosed area if NPPE playing a role.  Will discuss today with
   ENT/[**Doctor Last Name 4311**] and IP/[**Doctor Last Name 4950**].  Will keep NPO in case able to do tomorrow.
   - Try to obtain further information re: enzyme or ECG changes with
   acute episodes; also obtain recent cath if any (from St Vincents) and
   recent stress (from PCP) and recent TTE (from [**Hospital1 4942**]).
   - CXR now to eval tube placement.
   - ECG and check cardiac enzymes.  Check BNP.
   - Consider Aline if prolonged intubation or attempting to manage
   without trach.
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - CXR.
   - Check BNP.
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patient and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket to eval for abscess
   - Hold on specific abx treatment for now.
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - Ceftriaxone for now.  Resend UA and culture.  Consider broadening as
   has been in hospital a lot recently.
   - Check with OSH tomorrow re: culture update.
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain TTE results if really was performed today at OSH.
   - BB.  Hold ACE given ? allergy as above.
   - Lasix 40 IV BID for now, goal 1L neg in next 24 hours.  Mildly volume
   up.
   - Check BNP and CXR.
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - Statin.
   - ASA for now ? need to hold for trach.
   - Obtain cath, echo, stress reports as above.
   .
   # Afib. Currently mostly A paced on tele. Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on AC for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as above
   - Clarify AC plans.

   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic heart failure (CHF), and tracheal stenosis. She was admitted with acute respiratory failure and pulmonary edema of unclear etiology. She has had multiple reintubations due to acute onset respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema. The patient has a complicated tracheal history, with past tracheostomies and decannulation, and is currently intubated with a size 6 tracheostomy tube.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including chronic lung disease, acute pulmonary edema, and tracheal stenosis. The risk of further respiratory failure is high, particularly if the patient's tracheal stenosis is not managed effectively.
2. Tracheal Injury: The patient's repeated intubations and decannulations have likely caused tracheal injury, which may lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema (NPPE): The patient's history of tracheal stenosis and decannulation may be contributing to NPPE, which can cause further respiratory distress.
4. Acute Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient's history of CAD and CHF increases the risk of acute ischemic heart disease, which can lead to cardiac complications.
5. Volume Overload: The patient's history of CHF and pulmonary edema increases the risk of volume overload, which can exacerbate respiratory failure.
6. Anxiety and Depression: The patient's history of depression and anxiety may be contributing to her respiratory distress episodes and may require further management.
7. Infection: The patient's history of UTI and potential infections may increase the risk of further complications, particularly if not managed effectively.
8. Pacer Pocket Pain/Swelling: The patient's pacer pocket pain/swelling may be a sign of infection or abscess, which requires further evaluation and management.
9. Cardiac Enzyme Elevations: The patient's cardiac enzyme elevations may indicate cardiac complications, which require further evaluation and management.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue vent support at current settings overnight.
2. Consider more definitive airway management to prevent further tracheal injury and bypass stenosed areas.
3. Obtain further information on enzyme or ECG changes with acute episodes.
4. Check BNP and CXR to evaluate fluid status.
5. Continue CAD and CHF medications, but hold lisinopril due to potential allergy.
6. Consider Aline if prolonged intubation or attempting to manage without trach.
7. Obtain recent cath, stress, and TTE reports.
8. Evaluate pacer pocket for abscess and consider antibiotic treatment if necessary.
9. Monitor for signs of BZ withdrawal if Ativan is held.
10. Continue citalopram for depression/anxiety management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   # Hypernatremia: likely [**2-23**] dehydration, now resolved after successful
   PO intake.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis. Now s/p trach placement.
   - successfully weaned to trach collar, on 50% FM currently
   - encourage pt to suction upper airway secretions by herself
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.
   - continue citalopram
   - restart pt
s home Seroquel 50mg TID (will hold qhs Seroquel)
   - give Ativan q4-6h PO PRN for anxiety
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - has maintained even I/Os, will use Lasix PRN
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   will do inhalers prn.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket shows no abscess
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - continue Ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cx speciation/sensitivities
   - d/c Foley
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain OSH TTE
   - continue BB -> will switch to 12.5 mg PO BID
   - continue Lasix PRN

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and tracheal stenosis. She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) multiple times for acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is currently on a trach collar and is tolerating 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Her respiratory rate is 10 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of CAD and systolic CHF, and is currently taking medications for these conditions. Her blood pressure is 122/50 mmHg, and her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.
* Neurological status: The patient is alert and appears comfortable, but has a history of depression and anxiety.
* Renal status: The patient's urine output is 1,560 mL over the past 24 hours, and her creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL.
* Infectious disease status: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by lactose-fermenting Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and is currently receiving treatment with ceftriaxone.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, and is currently at risk for further respiratory decline due to her tracheal stenosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* Acute pulmonary edema: The patient has had multiple episodes of acute pulmonary edema, and is at risk for further episodes due to her systolic CHF and CAD.
* UTI: The patient has a current UTI, and is at risk for further complications if not properly treated.
* Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a history of CAD and systolic CHF, and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications if not properly managed.
* Tracheal stenosis: The patient has a history of tracheal stenosis, and is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.
* Anxiety and depression: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and is at risk for further complications if not properly managed.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue to manage the patient's cardiovascular disease with medications and lifestyle modifications.
* Continue to treat the patient's UTI with ceftriaxone and monitor for further complications.
* Consider further testing, such as a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out further cardiovascular complications.
* Consider further testing, such as a stress test, to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out further cardiovascular complications.
* Continue to manage the patient's tracheal stenosis with a trach collar and monitor for further complications.
* Continue to manage the patient's anxiety and depression with medications and lifestyle modifications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   been placed and the ET tube and the nasogastric tube have been removed.
   The
   tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.8 cm above the carina.
   Unchanged position and course of the pacemaker leads. The ventilation
   of the
   lung has improved. The costophrenic sinuses are substantially better
   visible
   than on the previous examination. Unchanged size of the cardiac
   silhouette,
   regression of the bilateral supradiaphragmatic areas of atelectasis. No
   evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   # Hypernatremia: likely [**2-23**] dehydration, now resolved after successful
   PO intake.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis. Now s/p trach placement.
   - successfully weaned to trach collar, on 50% FM currently
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - has maintained even I/Os, will use Lasix PRN
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patient and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket shows no abscess
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - continue Ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cx speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain OSH TTE
   - continue BB.  Hold ACE given ? allergy as above.
   - continue Lasix 40 IV
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - continue Statin
   - continue ASA  (was held for trach placement)
   - Obtain OSH cath, echo, stress reports as above
   .
   # Afib. Currently mostly A paced on tele. Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on anticoagulation for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as above
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and tracheal stenosis. She was admitted with recurrent acute pulmonary edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Successfully weaned to trach collar, on 50% FiO2 currently.
* Cardiovascular status: Has maintained even I/Os, will use Lasix PRN. CAD and CHF meds are being continued.
* Neurological status: Has a pacemaker in place, with some pacer pocket pain/swelling.
* Infection status: Has a UTI, with lactose-fermenting Gram-negative rods (GNRs) growing >100,000 organisms/mL in the urine culture.
* Electrolyte status: Hypernatremia has been resolved after successful PO intake.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 5.9, Hct 30.8, Plt 251 K/uL.
	+ Blood chemistry: Sodium 144 mmol/L, Potassium 4.1 mmol/L, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, Glucose 107 mg/dL.
	+ Coagulation studies: PT 12.9 seconds, PTT 27.9 seconds, INR 1.1.
	+ Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL.
	+ Differential count: Neutrophils 66.9%, Lymphocytes 23.8%, Monocytes 3.4%, Eosinophils 5.4%.
	+ Electrolyte panel: Calcium 8.9 mg/dL, Magnesium 2.2 mg/dL, Phosphorus 3.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: Continued respiratory distress, worsening of tracheal stenosis, and potential for further pulmonary edema.
* Cardiovascular instability: Continued CHF, CAD, and potential for arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.
* Infection: UTI, potential for further infection, and risk of sepsis.
* Electrolyte imbalance: Potential for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hyperkalemia.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy, gastritis, or gastrointestinal ulcers.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue respiratory support with trach collar and oxygen therapy.
* Continue cardiovascular medications, including beta blockers and diuretics.
* Continue antibiotics for UTI.
* Monitor electrolyte levels and correct any imbalances.
* Consider stress echocardiogram and catheterization to evaluate CAD.
* Continue depression and anxiety management with citalopram and Ativan as needed.
* Monitor for signs of BZ withdrawal if Ativan is held.
* Continue to monitor for potential complications and adjust treatment plan as needed."
