   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 69 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and
   recent radical cystectomy and neobladder who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension,
   fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)  Since his surgery last month, his
   rate has been very hard to control, but he was discharged on 100 mg
   metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]. TSH [**2-24**] was 3.4. Last echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated
   LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF. He has not been
   anticoagulated, and reports taking an aspirin; he states he was
   supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss [**Name9 (PRE) 6221**] after
   his surgery, but had not made it to that appointment yet. He reports he
   is aware of the risks of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation. Wish
   to avoid giving amiodarone unless last resort, as there is risk of
   thromboembolic event should he convert to sinus rhythm.
     --Continue 100 mg [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol
     --Continue digoxin ([**1-17**] loading dose given renal insufficiency)
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance
   - Repleting electrolytes (magnesium)
   - IVF given patient appears to be hypovolemic, bolus PRN hypotension or
   low urine outpu
   # Transitional cell carcinoma: Urology is following patient. His
   incisions appear well. Suspect he likely has infection of his
   neobladder.
   - Irrigate neobladder Q8H
   - Ceftriaxone per urology
   # Hypotension: Resolved with rate control and IVF
   - Work on rate control for atrial fibrillation
   - Ceftriaxone per urology for likely urinary tract infection
   - Blood, urine cultures pending.
   #
 SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, SBO, INCLUDING
   INTUSSUSCEPTION, ADHESIONS)
   [**Month (only) 51**] be developing recurrent illieus or partial small bowel obstruction.
   He did have a large bowel movement yesterday and is passing gas. No
   findings of ascites on examination, no tenderness. LFTs as noted above,
   added on amylase and lipase.
   - Monitoring serial abdominal examinations
   - Lactate pending
   - Patient refused NGT at present, agreed to re-consider should
   abdominal examination worsen, no longer passing flatus, etc.
   - Minimize narcotics when possible.
   # CAD: No active symptoms, no acute EKG changes.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg once check with urology in AM (ensure no
   anticipated need for interventions)
   - Continue statin
   - On beta-blocker
   # Renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine 0.8-1.0. Today
   creatinine up to 1.6. Not on any nephrotoxic medications. Did not
   improve with IVF, FENA/FeUREA equivocal.
   - Renal u/s
   - Monitor output (stable at present), following creatinine trend
   # Anemia: Hemodilution versus ACD versus hemolysis.
   - Add on LDH, fractionate bili given elevated Tbili yesterday
   # Ankle pain: Patient reports this is chronic secondary to arthritis.
   Given this is causing him considerable discomfort and tachycardia.
   - Morphine IV for now, given question of ilieus/PSBO
   # FEN: Holding PO's given ? SBO. Repleting electrolytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension,
   fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)  Since his surgery last month, his
   rate has been very hard to control, but he was discharged on 100 mg
   metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]. TSH [**2-24**] was 3.4. Last echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated
   LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF. He has not been
   anticoagulated, and reports taking an aspirin; he states he was
   supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss [**Name9 (PRE) 6221**] after
   his surgery, but had not made it to that appointment yet. He reports he
   is aware of the risks of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation. Wish
   to avoid giving amiodarone unless last resort, as there is risk of
   thromboembolic event should he convert to sinus rhythm.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent radical cystectomy and neobladder, and is currently admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure. He has a history of hard-to-control atrial fibrillation and has not been anticoagulated. He is currently receiving digoxin and ceftriaxone, and has been started on metoprolol. The patient is also experiencing small bowel obstruction, which is being monitored with serial abdominal examinations and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal discomfort suggest a possible septic episode, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Stroke: The patient's atrial fibrillation and lack of anticoagulation increase his risk of stroke, which could result in significant morbidity and mortality.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a concern, and could worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction could lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, and peritonitis if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not managed promptly and effectively, which could lead to organ failure and death.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a SpO2 of 94%, which could worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension increase his risk of cardiac arrest, which could result in significant morbidity and mortality.
8. Infection: The patient's neobladder infection is a concern, and could spread to other parts of the body if not managed promptly and effectively.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with digoxin and metoprolol.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's small bowel obstruction and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
4. Continue to manage the patient's anemia with blood transfusions and iron supplements.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardiac catheterization if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and consider surgical intervention if necessary.
8. Consider consulting with a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and urologist to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent radical cystectomy and neobladder, and is currently admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension, with a blood pressure of 123/66 mmHg
* Fever, with a temperature of 102.6°F
* Leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 187 K/uL
* Abdominal discomfort, with a suspicion of urinary tract infection and possible small bowel obstruction
* Acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL
* Atrial fibrillation, with a rapid ventricular response

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Metoprolol 100 mg PO daily
* Digoxin (loading dose given due to renal insufficiency)
* Ceftriaxone per urology
* Morphine IV for pain management
* IV fluids, with a total output of 1,365 mL over 24 hours
* Prophylactic heparin SQ TID for DVT prevention

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count, with a neutrophil count of 7.0 K/uL
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels
* Elevated liver enzymes, including AST and ALT
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level
* Elevated calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to urinary tract infection
* Small bowel obstruction and potential perforation
* Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest due to atrial fibrillation
* Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and hypercoagulability
* Anemia and bleeding due to gastrointestinal bleeding or hemolysis
* Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to altered glucose metabolism

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is recommended to:

* Continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely
* Administer antibiotics and antifungal medications as needed
* Manage pain and discomfort with morphine and other analgesics
* Monitor for signs of small bowel obstruction and potential perforation
* Consider performing a computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out an abscess or other complications
* Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation and potential cardiac arrhythmias

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent radical cystectomy and neobladder, and current admission for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, and fevers, and has been treated with antibiotics, IV fluids, and rate control medications. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction and is currently experiencing abdominal discomfort and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal discomfort suggest the possibility of sepsis, particularly in the setting of a recent surgical procedure and urinary tract infection.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's C. difficile positive stool culture and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder procedure increase the risk of UTI.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's abdominal discomfort, constipation, and history of SBO increase the risk of recurrent SBO.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure and recent IV fluids suggest the possibility of AKI.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation, rapid ventricular response, and tachycardia increase the risk of cardiac complications such as stroke, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia and recent blood loss may be contributing to his tachycardia and hypotension.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, may be contributing to his cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
8. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal discomfort suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, particularly in the setting of a recent surgical procedure.

These potential complications should be monitored and managed aggressively to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)  Since his surgery last month, his
   rate has been very hard to control, but he was discharged on 100 mg
   metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]. TSH [**2-24**] was 3.4. Last echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated
   LVH and dilated left atrium with low normal EF. He has not been
   anticoagulated, and reports taking an aspirin; he states he was
   supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss [**Name9 (PRE) 6221**] after
   his surgery, but had not made it to that appointment yet. He reports he
   is aware of the risks of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation. Wish
   to avoid giving amiodarone unless last resort, as there is risk of
   thromboembolic event should he convert to sinus rhythm.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Code status: Full, discussed with patient
   Disposition:  ICU until tachycardia, hypotension resolved, then to
   floor<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and recent radical cystectomy and neobladder. He was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 102.6°F (39.2°C), heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%.
* Physical examination: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress, appearing slightly uncomfortable, moving around in bed.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, platelet count 187 K/uL, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen 29 mg/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and his ventricular response is rapid, which can lead to tachycardia and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated, which can be a sign of infection or sepsis.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which can be a sign of infection or inflammation.
5. Abdominal discomfort: The patient is experiencing abdominal discomfort, which can be a sign of infection, inflammation, or bowel obstruction.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which can indicate kidney damage or failure.
7. C. difficile infection: The patient has a positive C. difficile test, which can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and life-threatening complications.
8. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can cause symptoms such as burning during urination, frequency, and urgency.
9. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's abdominal distension may be secondary to C. difficile, but the possibility of small bowel obstruction cannot be ruled out.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Rate control for atrial fibrillation: The patient is being treated with metoprolol to control his heart rate.
2. Antibiotics: The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone for his urinary tract infection.
3. Irrigation of the neobladder: The patient's neobladder is being irrigated every 8 hours to prevent infection and promote healing.
4. Fluid management: The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and IV fluids are being administered as needed to prevent dehydration and hypotension.
5. Blood cultures: The patient's blood cultures are pending to determine if he has a bloodstream infection.
6. Urine cultures: The patient's urine cultures are pending to determine if he has a urinary tract infection.
7. CT scan: The patient may undergo a CT scan to rule out small bowel obstruction and to assess for any potential complications.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

   Since his surgery last month, his rate has been very hard to control,
   but he was discharged on 100 mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 7**]. TSH [**2-24**] was 3.4. Last
   echo was [**10/2126**] demonstrated LVH and dilated left atrium with low
   normal EF. He has not been anticoagulated, and reports taking an
   aspirin; he states he was supposed to follow up with his PCP to discuss

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent radical cystectomy and neobladder, and acute renal failure. He was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure. His vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.7°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 122 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 90%

Physical examination reveals:

* Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress
* Slightly uncomfortable, moving around in bed
* Soft but mild to moderately distended abdomen, no tenderness, guarding, or rebound tenderness
* Warm, no clubbing/cyanosis/edema

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 170 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 105 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.1 g/dL
* LDH: 215 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.2 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and the rapid ventricular response may lead to further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This may be secondary to sepsis, hypotension, or other factors.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, which may be causing his abdominal discomfort and fever.
4. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's abdominal distension may be secondary to a small bowel obstruction, which could lead to further complications such as bowel perforation or necrosis.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's abdominal distension may also be secondary to a C. difficile infection, which could lead to further complications such as colitis or toxic megacolon.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This may be secondary to chronic bleeding, bone marrow failure, or other factors.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be secondary to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other factors.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may be secondary to various factors such as dehydration, vomiting, or diuretic use.

Plan:

* Increase metoprolol to 100 mg tid to control atrial fibrillation
* Discontinue digoxin and attempt rate control with other medications
* Begin anticoagulation with warfarin
* Repleting electrolytes prn
* Irrigate neobladder Q8H
* Ceftriaxone per urology for likely UTI
* Flagyl q8h po for C. difficile infection
* Monitor output and follow creatinine trend to assess renal function
* Continue ASA 325 mg once and statin
* Continue beta-blocker
* Monitor for signs of cardiac failure, stroke, or other complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent radical cystectomy and neobladder, and transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal discomfort, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including:

1. Pyelonephritis/Fever: The patient has a urine culture growing pansensitive klebsiella, suggesting an infection of the neobladder/pyelonephritis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved with rate control and IV fluid administration.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's abdominal distention may be secondary to C. difficile infection.
4. C. difficile Infection (CDiff): The patient is being treated with Flagyl q8h po.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal insufficiency is suspected to be due to ATN in the setting of recent hypotension, now resolving.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is back to baseline, and the LDH is normal, suggesting hemolysis.
7. Ankle Pain: The patient reports chronic ankle pain secondary to arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's pyelonephritis and C. difficile infection increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Kidney Injury: The patient's ARF may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may worsen if not controlled.
4. Infection Progression: The patient's infections (pyelonephritis, C. difficile) may spread to other areas of the body.
5. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition may worsen if not addressed.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if not controlled.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to ensure that the infections are being controlled and that the patient's renal function is improving.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotic therapy as necessary to ensure that the infections are being effectively treated.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust the patient's fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
4. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to optimize the patient's atrial fibrillation management.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide recommendations for improving nutrition.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to optimize the patient's renal function management.
7. Monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and adjust the patient's fluid and vasopressor therapy as necessary to prevent hemodynamic instability."
