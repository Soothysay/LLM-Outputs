   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Septic Shock: Fever, tachycardia and hypotension (has responded to
   fluids).  Patient asplenic so encapsulated organisms likely, and with
   consolidation on CXR, strep pnemo is most likely organism.  Patient
   also has history of MRSA swab positive, which makes MRSA possible.
   Recent sexual exposures were protected, but could consider GC as
   another possible source.
   -Vanco/Zosyn for now.  Can consider narrowing to ceftriaxone +
   azithromycin if cultures remain negative after 48 hours.
   -f/u cultures (blood, urine, stool).  Will send sputum for culture if
   develops a productive cough
   -allow pt to take POs, will follow u/o.  Goal U/O > 50 cc/hr.  will
   bolus LR.
   -follow fever curve on antibiotics
   -d/c central line and foley cath given well-appearing
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr up to 1.3 from baseline 0.9, although recent
   outpatient Cr 1.44.  Likely pre-renal component.
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr after fluid rescuscitation.
   -check urine lytes
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   -confirm HIV care and last CD4/viral load with PCP tomorrow
   [**Name9 (PRE) 175**] home efavirenz--a NNRTI, emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and
   tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.   ? viral load.
   - touch base with PCP re whether or not patient is aware.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 861**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10614**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10615**]
   #Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors:
   - continue home atorvastatin
   - continue home ASA
   - hold lisinopril in context of concern for hypotension.  Can restart
   if BP holds well.
   #Hep B:  diagnosed [**2117**].  ""completed treatment"" at that time.
   #FEN: non-anion gap acidosis (pH 7.36), likely secondary to NS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, recent strep viridans sepsis, and a history of MRSA swab positivity. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102.8°F (39.3°C)
* Heart rate: 84-108 bpm
* Blood pressure: 128/51 mmHg (70-131/63 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Central venous pressure: 8-12 mmHg

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fevers.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 28.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 34.6%
* Platelet count: 383 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19 mEq/L
* Serum sodium: 140 mEq/L
* Serum potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
* Serum glucose: 125 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Septic shock: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected strep pneumoniae infection. Cultures are pending, and consideration is being given to narrowing antibiotic therapy to ceftriaxone and azithromycin if cultures remain negative.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine has increased from a baseline of 0.9 to 1.3 mg/dL, likely due to a pre-renal component. Fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and the patient's urine output is being closely monitored.
* HIV: The patient's last CD4 count was >600, and his viral load is undetectable. He is on Atripla therapy.
* Hepatitis C: The patient's recent testing showed hepatitis C antibody positivity, but his viral load is unknown.
* Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors: The patient is being continued on home atorvastatin and ASA, and lisinopril is being held due to concerns about hypotension.
* Hepatitis B: The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 2017 and has completed treatment.
* Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient's pH is 7.36, likely due to normal saline administration. The patient is on a regular diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute kidney injury
* Hepatitis C-related liver disease
* Hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease
* Non-anion gap acidosis
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Hyperglycemia due to diabetes
* Catheter-related infections (e.g., central line-associated bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection)
* Venous thromboembolism (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying risk factors."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. He has a history of strep viridans sepsis and has recently been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His current medications include heparin, atorvastatin, and ASA. He has a recent history of Hepatitis C and has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors. His lab results show an elevated WBC count, Cr up to 1.3, and a pH of 7.36.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are consistent with septic shock. As he is asplenic, encapsulated organisms such as strep pnemo are likely. The patient's history of MRSA and recent sexual exposures make MRSA and GC possible sources.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's Cr level is elevated, likely due to a pre-renal component. Close monitoring of u/o and Cr levels is necessary.
3. Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors: The patient's elevated lipid levels and CAD risk factors make him susceptible to cardiovascular complications.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient's recent testing shows Hepatitis C antibody positivity, and his viral load is unknown. Monitoring his liver function and considering antiviral therapy may be necessary.
5. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient's pH of 7.36 suggests non-anion gap acidosis, likely secondary to NS administration. Monitoring his electrolytes and acid-base status is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for septic shock and consider narrowing to ceftriaxone and azithromycin if cultures remain negative after 48 hours.
2. Monitor u/o and Cr levels closely and consider diuretic therapy if necessary.
3. Continue home medications, including atorvastatin and ASA, and restart lisinopril if BP holds well.
4. Monitor liver function and consider antiviral therapy for Hepatitis C.
5. Monitor acid-base status and electrolytes and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Consider discontinuing NS administration and using LR instead.
7. Continue diabetic diet and insulin therapy for glycemic control.
8. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust therapy accordingly."

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, recent strep viridans sepsis, and a history of MRSA swab positivity. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. His initial vital signs included a temperature of 103°F, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 80s/50s mmHg. He received a 1 L LR bolus and responded well. His current vital signs are: temperature 102.8°F, heart rate 84 bpm, and blood pressure 128/51 mmHg. He has a history of Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, and is currently on antiretroviral therapy for HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggests septic shock. The patient's asplenic status and recent strep viridans sepsis make encapsulated organisms a likely cause. The presence of consolidation on CXR and history of MRSA swab positivity also suggest MRSA as a possible source.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 0.9 mg/dL, suggesting acute renal failure. The patient's fluid status and urine output will need to be closely monitored.
3. Hepatitis C: The patient's recent testing showed Hepatitis C antibody positivity, but the viral load is unknown. The patient's HIV status and antiretroviral therapy may affect the progression of Hepatitis C.
4. Non-Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's pH level is 7.36, indicating a non-anion gap acidosis. This may be secondary to the administration of normal saline (NS) and can be managed by switching to lactated Ringer's (LR) solution.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a total input of 7,780 mL and a total output of 1,845 mL, resulting in a balance of 5,935 mL. This may indicate fluid overload, which can worsen the patient's condition.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and increased risk of organ dysfunction.
7. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Closely monitor the patient's fluid status and urine output to prevent fluid overload and acute renal failure.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's antiretroviral therapy to optimize HIV management.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and Hepatitis C viral load to assess the progression of Hepatitis C.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's acid-base status and adjust fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider adjusting the patient's anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and embolism.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider adjusting antiretroviral therapy to optimize cardiac management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, was admitted to the ICU with fever, chills, and hypotension. He had a recent history of strep viridans sepsis and had received antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Zosyn. His vital signs were tachycardic, with a temperature of 102.8°F, and his blood pressure was 128/51 mmHg. He was receiving fluids and had responded well to the treatment. His laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count, but his CD4 count was above 600, and his viral load was undetectable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are consistent with septic shock. His asplenia increases the risk of encapsulated organisms, and the presence of consolidation on his chest X-ray suggests strep pneumonia as the most likely cause. MRSA is also a possibility, given his history of MRSA swab positivity.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.4 mg/dL from a baseline of 0.9 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. This is likely pre-renal in origin, and the patient will need to be closely monitored for fluid status and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hyperlipidemia/CAD Risk Factors: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular disease due to his hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors. His atorvastatin and ASA will need to be continued, and his lisinopril will need to be held due to concerns about hypotension.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient has recently tested positive for hepatitis C antibody, but his viral load is unknown. He will need to be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
5. HIV: The patient's HIV is well-controlled, with a CD4 count above 600 and an undetectable viral load. He will need to be followed closely to ensure that his HIV is managed effectively.
6. FEN (Non-anion gap acidosis): The patient's non-anion gap acidosis is likely secondary to the administration of normal saline, which has a high chloride content. He will need to be monitored for this condition and have his fluids adjusted accordingly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his septic shock, acute renal failure, and other potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Oriented to person, place, and time

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Shock, septic
* Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
* Pneumonia
* Hypotension
* Acute renal failure

The plan is to continue present antibiotics, monitor urine output, and await culture results. If urine output drops below 50 cc/hr, the patient may be started on autodiuretic therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability
* Respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias
* Infection-related complications, including bacteremia and septic shock
* Renal failure, including chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease
* Pneumonia-related complications, including bronchospasm, pneumothorax, and respiratory failure

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Pt presented w fever, tachycardia and hypotension, which has
   responded to fluids.   Patient asplenic so there is concern for
   encapsulated organisms.  Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR; pt has not
   had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.   Left leg cellulites
   started yesterday morning, worsened overnight, even after starting
   vancomycin; because fevers and chills started prior to cellulitis
   appearance, it may or may not be the source of his initial hypotension
   and fevers.  Patient also has history of MRSA swab positive, which
   makes MRSA possible.   GC swabs negative.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - follow fever curve on antibiotics
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline in past appeared to be
   0.9, although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150+ cc/hr.
   FeNa 2.1%, FeUrea 54% so patient likely has intrarenal chronic renal
   insufficiency
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   - continue antiretrovirals: continue home efavirenz--a NNRTI,
   emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Pt presented w fever, tachycardia and hypotension, which has
   responded to fluids.   Patient asplenic so there is concern for
   encapsulated organisms.  Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR; pt has not
   had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.   Left leg cellulites
   started yesterday morning, worsened overnight, even after starting
   vancomycin; because fevers and chills started prior to cellulitis
   appearance, it may or may not be the source of his initial hypotension
   and fevers.  Patient also has history of MRSA swab positive, which
   makes MRSA possible.   GC swabs negative.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - follow fever curve on antibiotics
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline in past appeared to be
   0.9, although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150+ cc/hr.

Summary:

The patient, a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, is admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. He has a history of strep viridans sepsis and presents with chills, lightheadedness, and elevated WBC. The patient is receiving antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) and has a diagnosis of sepsis, acute renal failure, and HIV. He also has a history of MRSA and Hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis. The presence of cellulitis on the left leg and the patient's asplenic state increase the risk of encapsulated organisms.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and his urine output is 150+ cc/hr. This suggests intrarenal chronic renal insufficiency.
3. HIV: The patient's last CD4 count was > 600, and his viral load is undetectable. However, his recent Hepatitis C testing shows Ab+, and his viral load is unknown.
4. Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors: The patient is taking atorvastatin and ASA for hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors. However, the patient's recent blood work shows elevated lipids.
5. Hepatitis B: The patient has a history of Hepatitis B, which was diagnosed in [**2117**] and treated.
6. VAP: The patient has a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his prolonged immobility and his history of asplenia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) and monitor the patient's fever curve.
2. Follow the patient's urine output and trend his creatinine level.
3. Continue antiretrovirals (Atripla) and monitor the patient's HIV status.
4. Consider restarting lisinopril if the patient's blood pressure stabilizes.
5. Monitor the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) for signs of liver damage.
6. Consider prophylaxis for VAP and DVT.
7. Monitor the patient's wound care and consider debridement if necessary."

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his history with him, and
   was present for the key portion of the services provided.  I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   Mr [**Known lastname 3781**] feels better, his BP is improved, and his WBC and fever are
   trending down.  I am not convinced pneumonia is the cause of his
septic
 presentation, and while  his cellulitis would explain his
   initial presenting clinical sx, he actually didn
t have any cellulitic
   findins till yesterday. Hence his cellulitis appears to have occurred
   while on Vanco and Zosyn.  Bld cultures are neg and overall he is not
   toxic, but for now, until I am convinced his left shin cellulitis is

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Pt presented w fever, tachycardia and hypotension, which has
   responded to fluids.   Patient asplenic so there is concern for
   encapsulated organisms.  Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR; pt has not
   had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.   Left leg cellulites
   started yesterday morning, worsened overnight, even after starting
   vancomycin; because fevers and chills started prior to cellulitis
   appearance, it may or may not be the source of his initial hypotension
   and fevers.  Patient also has history of MRSA swab positive, which
   makes MRSA possible.   GC swabs negative.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - follow fever curve on antibiotics
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline in past appeared to be
   0.9, although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150+ cc/hr.
   FeNa 2.1%, FeUrea 54% so patient likely has intrarenal chronic renal
   insufficiency
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   - continue antiretrovirals: continue home efavirenz--a NNRTI,
   emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab
   PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.    viral load unknown.

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his history with him, and
   was present for the key portion of the services provided.  I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   Mr [**Known lastname 3781**] feels better, his BP is improved, and his WBC and fever are
   trending down.  I am not convinced pneumonia is the cause of his
septic
 presentation, and while  his cellulitis would explain his
   initial presenting clinical sx, he actually didn
t have any cellulitic
   findins till yesterday. Hence his cellulitis appears to have occurred
   while on Vanco and Zosyn.  Bld cultures are neg and overall he is not
   toxic, but for now, until I am convinced his left shin cellulitis is
   improving I would continue both of these antibiotics, especially with
   his asplenic state and prior positive MRSA status.  He has already been
   called out to the floor and can be transferred once a bed is
   available.  If he doesn
t continue to improve I would have a low
   threshold for ID consultation.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, admitted to the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia with fever. He has a history of strep viridans sepsis, and his recent CD4 count is 600.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 38.3°C, Tcurrent 37.3°C, HR 80 bpm, BP 120/62 mmHg, RR 26 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC 28.1
	+ Hct 34.6%
	+ Plt 383
	+ Cr 1.4 mg/dL
	+ Glucose 125 mg/dL
	+ Other lab results (PT, PTT, INR, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, TBili, etc.)
* Physical examination: Alert, oriented, no distress. Pleasant, conversational. Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear without thrush. Neck supple, JVP not appreciated, no LAD. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or ronchi.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

* Sepsis: The patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which has responded to fluids. There is concern for encapsulated organisms due to his asplenic state. Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR, and the patient has not had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.
* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's Cr is 1.4 mg/dL, and urine output is 150+ cc/hr. FeNa 2.1%, FeUrea 54%, indicating intrarenal chronic renal insufficiency.
* HIV: The patient's last CD4 count was >600, and his viral load is undetectable. He is on antiretroviral therapy (Atripla).
* Hep C: The patient has recently tested positive for Hep C Ab+, but the viral load is unknown.
* Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors: The patient is on home atorvastatin and ASA, and lisinopril is being held due to concern for hypotension.
* Hep B: The patient has a history of Hep B, which was diagnosed in 2017 and treated.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis
* Follow fever curve on antibiotics
* Monitor urine output and trend Cr for acute renal failure
* Continue antiretroviral therapy (Atripla)
* Consider ID consultation if the patient does not continue to improve

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Hepatitis-related complications (e.g., liver failure, cirrhosis)
* Cardiovascular complications (e.g., myocardial infarction, heart failure) due to hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors
* Opportunistic infections due to HIV/AIDS and asplenic state."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Sepsis:  Pt presented w fever, tachycardia and hypotension, which has
   responded to fluids.   Patient asplenic so there is concern for
   encapsulated organisms.  Pneumonia is not convincing on CXR; pt has not
   had productive cough or respiratory symptoms.   Left leg cellulites
   started yesterday morning, worsened overnight, even after starting
   vancomycin; because fevers and chills started prior to cellulitis
   appearance, it may or may not be the source of his initial hypotension
   and fevers.  Patient also has history of MRSA swab positive, which
   makes MRSA possible.   GC swabs negative.
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - follow fever curve on antibiotics
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline in past appeared to be
   0.9, although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150+ cc/hr.
   FeNa 2.1%, FeUrea 54% so patient likely has intrarenal chronic renal
   insufficiency
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   - continue antiretrovirals: continue home efavirenz--a NNRTI,
   emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab
   PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.    viral load unknown.
   - PCP:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 861**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10614**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10615**]
   #Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors:
   - continue home atorvastatin and ASA
   - hold lisinopril in context of concern for hypotension.  Can restart
   tomorrow if BP holds well
   #Hep B:  diagnosed [**2117**].  ""completed treatment"" at that time.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. He has a history of strep viridans sepsis, and his recent CD4 count is 673, with an undetectable viral load.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 38.3°C, Tcurrent 37.3°C, HR 80 bpm, BP 120/62 mmHg, RR 26 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Physical examination: The patient is alert, oriented, and has no distress. He has a pleasant, conversational demeanor. His HEENT examination is normal, and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
* Lab results: The patient's WBC count is 28.1, Hct is 34.6%, and Plt is 383. His Cr is 1.4 mg/dL, and his Glucose is 125 mg/dL.

The patient has several medical conditions and allergies, including HIV, recent strep viridans sepsis, MRSA, and hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors. He is currently receiving antibiotics, antiretrovirals, and other medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may be related to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's Cr level is 1.4 mg/dL, which may indicate acute renal failure. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications if not managed properly.
* HIV: The patient's undetectable viral load and high CD4 count suggest that his HIV is well-controlled. However, he may be at risk for opportunistic infections if his immune system is compromised.
* MRSA: The patient's history of MRSA swab positivity and current cellulitis may increase his risk for MRSA infection, which can lead to severe sepsis and organ failure.
* Hepatitis C: The patient's recent testing shows Ab positivity, but his viral load is unknown. This may increase his risk for liver damage and other complications if left untreated.
* Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors may increase his risk for cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his medical conditions to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent CD4=600), with
   recent strep viridans sepsis ([**Month (only) 572**]/[**2148-6-14**]) presents with chills,
   lightheadedness, and elevated wbc who is admitted to the ICU for
   hypotension and tachycardia with fever.
   .
   # Septic Shock: Fever, tachycardia and hypotension (has responded to
   fluids).  Patient asplenic so encapsulated organisms likely, and with
   consolidation on CXR, strep pnemo is most likely organism.  Patient
   also has history of MRSA swab positive, which makes MRSA possible.
   Recent sexual exposures were protected, but could consider GC as
   another possible source.
   -Vanco/Zosyn for now.
   - Narrow to ceftriaxone + azithromycin if cultures remain negative
   after 48 hours.
   -f/u cultures (blood, urine, stool).  Will send sputum for culture if
   develops a productive cough
   -allow pt to take POs, will follow u/o.  Goal U/O > 50 cc/hr.  will
   bolus LR.
   -follow fever curve on antibiotics
   -d/c central line and foley cath given well-appearing
   #Acute Renal Failure:  Cr 1.4 , though baseline appears to be 0.9,
   although recent outpatient Cr 1.44.  Urine output 150cc/hr.  FeNa 2.1%,
   FeUrea 54%
   -will follow u/o and trend Cr after fluid rescuscitation.
   .
   #HIV:  last CD4 > 600 per pt, viral load undetectable.  On Atripla
   -confirm HIV care and last CD4/viral load with PCP tomorrow
   [**Name9 (PRE) 175**] home efavirenz--a NNRTI, emtricitabine--a nucleoside RTI, and
   tenofavir--a nucleoside RTI, 1 tab PO daily.
   #Hep C:  recent testing [**10-23**] shows Ab +.   ? viral load.
   - touch base with PCP re whether or not patient is aware.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 861**]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10614**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10615**]
   #Hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors:
   - continue home atorvastatin
   - continue home ASA
   - hold lisinopril in context of concern for hypotension.  Can restart
   if BP holds well.
   #Hep B:  diagnosed [**2117**].  ""completed treatment"" at that time.
   #FEN: non-anion gap acidosis (pH 7.36), likely secondary to NS
   administration (Cl 111), regular diet.
   -No NS for IVF, will use LR if needed
   -full diabetic diet for now given low likelihood of intubation

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old asplenic male with HIV, admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute renal failure, and hyperlipidemia/CAD risk factors. He has a history of strep viridans sepsis and has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. He is currently receiving fluids, and his blood cultures are pending. He has a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which have responded to fluids. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to encapsulated organisms, such as strep pneumo, and may require further treatment with antibiotics.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine output is decreased. He may require further fluid resuscitation and potentially dialysis.
3. Hyperlipidemia/CAD Risk Factors: The patient's hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors may increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction.
4. Hepatitis B: The patient has a history of hepatitis B and may require further monitoring and treatment.
5. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient's pH is 7.36, which may indicate a non-anion gap acidosis, potentially secondary to NS administration.
6. Fever Curve: The patient's fever curve should be monitored closely to ensure that his infection is responding to treatment.
7. Central Line and Foley Catheter: The patient's central line and foley catheter should be removed as soon as possible to minimize the risk of complications.
8. HIV: The patient's HIV status should be monitored closely, and he should be treated with antiretroviral therapy as necessary.
9. Hepatitis C: The patient's hepatitis C status should be monitored closely, and he should be treated with antiviral therapy as necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for septic shock and monitor the patient's response.
2. Continue fluid resuscitation and monitor the patient's urine output and creatinine level.
3. Monitor the patient's fever curve and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Remove central line and foley catheter as soon as possible.
5. Monitor the patient's HIV and hepatitis C status closely.
6. Consider antiviral therapy for hepatitis C.
7. Continue antiretroviral therapy for HIV as necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's hyperlipidemia and CAD risk factors closely.
9. Consider further treatment for non-anion gap acidosis."
