   Assessment and Plan
   IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman admitted to hospital s/p fall and transfered
   to the CCU with bradycardia
   .
   PLAN
   # Bradycardia: Transferred from the floor with hypotensive
   bradycardia.  She has had similar episodes here, worse during periods
   around sleep and responsive to atropine.  Has had myoclonic jerks
   suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion.  Family was initally hesititant
   to place a placemaker, but now wishes to have one placed.    Most
   likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block as no unconducted p
   waves observed during bradycardia.
   - EP consult early for placement.  Will need DNR/DNI status temporarily
   reversed & consent from HCP (brother).
   - Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed.
   - Dopamine or isoproteronol if needed for chronotrophic support.
   - hold metoprolol indefinitely.
   .
   # Low Urine output:  Appears dry.  Contraction alkalosis responds to
   IVF.  Orthostasis may have contributed to falls.
   - NS bolus, IVF.
   .
   # Elevated TSH: T3/T4 normal.  Likely sick euthyroid.
   .
   # Fall: likely that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.  Echo shoed
   mild AS, but not likely to be causitive.  No focal neuro deficits.
   - PT consult
   - consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia
   characterized and plan in place
   .
   # Hypertension; hold metoprolol
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia; continue statin
   .
   # CODE: DNR/DNI but ok for atropine and transcutaneous pacing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with bradycardia and hypotension. She has a history of falls and was initially hesitant to have a pacemaker placed, but her family has now agreed to proceed with the procedure. She has had multiple episodes of bradycardia, including a 30-second episode of severe bradycardia with loss of consciousness and brief respiratory arrest. She has been treated with atropine, which has helped to improve her heart rate. She also has a history of depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is a potential life-threatening condition that can lead to cardiac arrest if not properly managed. The use of atropine has helped to improve her heart rate, but further management is needed to prevent future episodes.
2. Myoclonus: The patient's myoclonic jerks are a potential sign of cerebral hypoperfusion, which can be a complication of bradycardia. Further management is needed to prevent further episodes of myoclonus.
3. Low Urine Output: The patient's low urine output is a potential sign of dehydration or kidney damage. Further management is needed to prevent further dehydration and kidney damage.
4. Elevated TSH: The patient's elevated TSH is a potential sign of hypothyroidism, which can be a complication of bradycardia. Further management is needed to determine the cause of the elevated TSH and to prevent further complications.
5. Fall Risk: The patient's history of falls and her current bradycardia make her at high risk for further falls. Further management is needed to prevent further falls and to reduce the risk of injury.
6. Depression: The patient's depression is a potential complication of her bradycardia and other medical conditions. Further management is needed to treat her depression and to prevent further complications.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is a potential risk factor for further complications, including heart disease and stroke. Further management is needed to treat her hyperlipidemia and to prevent further complications.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a potential risk factor for further complications, including heart disease and stroke. Further management is needed to treat her hypertension and to prevent further complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the hospital after a fall and transferred to the CCU due to bradycardia. The note highlights several key events and findings:

1. Bradycardia: The patient experienced multiple episodes of bradycardia, including a 30-second episode with loss of consciousness, brief respiratory arrest, and clonus with arousal. The episodes were all during sleep or the peri-sleep period.
2. Atropine administration: The patient received atropine multiple times to treat bradycardia, with the most recent dose being 0.5 mg at 5:30 AM.
3. Pacemaker placement: The patient's family decided to proceed with pacemaker placement, and the EP fellow is aware of the situation.
4. DNR/DNI status: The patient's code status was confirmed as DNR/DNI, with no pacemaker or temporary wire.
5. Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results include a normal Cr level of 0.9 and a high glucose level of 151.
6. Physical examination: The patient's physical examination revealed a laceration on her head, a 2/6 systolic murmur heard at the left lower sternal border, and 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
7. Neurological examination: The patient was not oriented and had noted myoclonus.
8. Review of systems: The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the bradycardia episodes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sinus arrest or pauses: The patient's bradycardia episodes may be related to sinus arrest or pauses, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.
2. Sino-atrial exit block: The patient's bradycardia episodes may also be related to sino-atrial exit block, which can be a more serious condition that requires urgent treatment.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's bradycardia episodes may be related to a myocardial infarction (MI), which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's elevated TSH level may indicate hypothyroidism, which can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, and depression.
5. Fall-related injuries: The patient's fall may have caused injuries that are not yet apparent, such as head trauma or internal injuries.

In conclusion, the patient's bradycardia episodes are a serious concern and require close monitoring and treatment. The patient's DNR/DNI status and pacemaker placement plans are also important considerations in her care."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, an 90-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital after a fall and was transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia. She was found to have a pacemaker (PPM) placed yesterday, which resolved her bradycardia. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 158/66 mmHg. She has a mild systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border radiating to the carotids.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, and elevated creatinine levels at 0.9 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count and platelet count are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, and a history of falls. She is currently receiving several medications, including anticoagulation therapy with heparin, and has a pacemaker in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia can recur, especially if the pacemaker is not functioning properly.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, which can increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.
3. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia can worsen if left untreated, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's high cholesterol levels can increase her risk of cardiovascular disease, especially if left untreated.
5. Depression: The patient's depression can worsen if left untreated, leading to decreased quality of life and increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
6. Falls: The patient's history of falls can increase her risk of future falls, especially if her underlying medical conditions are not well-controlled.
7. Pacemaker complications: The patient's pacemaker can malfunction or become infected, leading to serious complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital after a fall and was transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia. She underwent placement of a permanent pacemaker (PPM) yesterday. Her current vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute and blood pressure of 158/66 mmHg. She is receiving dopamine for a heart rate of less than 40 beats per minute. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and her SpO2 is 98%. Her physical examination is notable for a laceration on her head and a systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.4-10.6 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 10.8-10.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 198-181 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.7-0.8 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 111-151 mg/dL. Her PT/PTT/INR levels are 13.9/34.6/1.2, and her calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia was resolved with the placement of a PPM, but she may still be at risk for recurrent bradycardia or heart block.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, or renal disease.
3. Low urine output: The patient's urine output is decreased, which may indicate a risk of acute kidney injury or dehydration.
4. Elevated TSH: The patient's TSH level is elevated, which may indicate a risk of hypothyroidism or thyroid dysfunction.
5. Fall risk: The patient is at risk for further falls due to her age and underlying medical conditions.
6. Depression: The patient is at risk for depression due to her recent hospitalization and fall, and her current treatment with fluoxetine.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase her risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.
8. DNR/DNI status: The patient has a DNR/DNI status, which may affect her treatment options and quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman admitted to hospital s/p fall and transfered
   to the CCU with bradycardia
   .
   PLAN
   # Bradycardia: Transferred from the floor with hypotensive
   bradycardia.  She has had similar episodes here, worse during periods
   around sleep and responsive to atropine.  Has had myoclonic jerks
   suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion.  Family was initally hesititant
   to place a placemaker, but now wishes to have one placed.    Most
   likely etiology is sick sinus or sinus exit block as no unconducted p
   waves observed during bradycardia.
   - EP consult early for placement.  Will need DNR/DNI status temporarily
   reversed & consent from HCP (brother).
   - Continue atropine for HR at 60, pacer pads placed.
   - Dopamine or isoproteronol if needed for chronotrophic support.
   - hold metoprolol indefinitely.
   .
   # Low Urine output:  Appears dry.  Contraction alkalosis responds to
   IVF.  Orthostasis may have contributed to falls.
   - NS bolus, IVF.
   .
   # Elevated TSH: T3/T4 normal.  Likely sick euthyroid.
   .
   # Fall: likely that sinus pauses/bradycardia were the etiology, but
   unknown as patient has not had then thus far while awake.  Echo shoed
   mild AS, but not likely to be causitive.  No focal neuro deficits.
   - PT consult
   - consider transfer to medicine for further workup once bradycardia
   characterized and plan in place
   .
   # Hypertension; hold metoprolol
   .
   # Depression: continue fluoxetine
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia; continue statin
   .
   # CODE: DNR/DNI but ok for atropine and transcutaneous pacing.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital after a fall and was transferred to the ICU due to bradycardia. The patient has a pacemaker placed, and her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm and a blood pressure of 158/66 mmHg. She is receiving dopamine for chronotropic support and has a nasogastric tube in place.

The patient's physical examination reveals a laceration on her head, a systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border, and 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally. She is not oriented and has noted myoclonus.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.4, a hematocrit of 32.1, and a platelet count of 198. Her creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL, and her glucose is 151 mg/dL. Other laboratory results include a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), as well as elevated calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient's condition is assessed as likely due to sick sinus syndrome or sinus exit block, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) consult is planned for pacemaker placement. The patient's low urine output is attributed to contraction alkalosis and orthostasis, and IV fluids are being administered.

The patient's fall is thought to be likely related to sinus pauses/bradycardia, but this has not been observed while she is awake. An echocardiogram showed mild aortic stenosis, but this is not thought to be causative. The patient's TSH level is elevated, but her T3 and T4 levels are normal, suggesting sick euthyroid syndrome.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but she is allowed to receive atropine and transcutaneous pacing. The patient's medications include cephalexin, heparin, atropine, dopamine, colace, senna, fluoxetine, vitamin D, simvastatin, and percocet.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia can worsen, leading to hypotension, cardiac arrest, or cardiac failure.
* Low urine output: The patient's low urine output can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acute kidney injury.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can worsen, leading to cardiac complications, stroke, or renal failure.
* Depression: The patient's depression can worsen, leading to suicidal thoughts or behaviors.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia can worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events.
* Cerebral hypoperfusion: The patient's cerebral hypoperfusion can worsen, leading to confusion, disorientation, or even stroke.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure her safe care."
