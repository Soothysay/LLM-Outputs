   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -hold BB given hemodynamics
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -no bb for now given cardiogenic shock
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with likely STEMI, 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion, and LV dysfunction. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and is currently undergoing treatment for cardiogenic shock. He is being managed with IABP, nipride drip, and lasix to reduce afterload and preload. His cardiac index is low, and he has elevated filling pressures. He has also been diagnosed with anemia, transaminitis, and possible renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac index and elevated filling pressures make him at risk for further deterioration.
	* Myocardial infarction: The patient's 3VD and chronic RCA occlusion make him at risk for further myocardial infarction.
	* Heart failure: The patient's LV dysfunction and elevated filling pressures make him at risk for heart failure.
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and possible chronic renal failure make him at risk for acute kidney injury.
	* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic RCA occlusion and possible chronic renal failure make him at risk for chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's crackles on the right side of his chest and possible cardiac tamponade make him at risk for pneumonia.
	* Respiratory failure: The patient's low cardiac index and elevated filling pressures make him at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Neurological complications:
	* Stroke: The patient's 3VD and chronic RCA occlusion make him at risk for stroke.
	* Seizures: The patient's possible cardiac tamponade and electrolyte imbalances make him at risk for seizures.
5. Hematological complications:
	* Hemolytic anemia: The patient's IABP and possible hemolysis make him at risk for hemolytic anemia.
	* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's possible IABP-induced thrombocytopenia make him at risk for thrombocytopenia.
6. Infection complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's possible cardiac tamponade and possible sepsis make him at risk for sepsis.
	* Catheter-related infections: The patient's IABP and PA catheter make him at risk for catheter-related infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -very low dose BB
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male with a history of hypertension, who presented with likely STEMI several days ago. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and has been found to have 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and significant aortic stenosis. He has also been diagnosed with LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been placed on an IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction, and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His cardiac index is 4.0 L/min/m2, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is 47-74%. He has been receiving infusions of heparin, nitroprusside, and lasix, and has been monitored with Swan-Ganz catheter.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 256 K/uL, and troponin-T of 4.12 ng/mL. His creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 25 mEq/L. His liver function tests show a bilirubin of 1.1 mg/dL, and his amylase and lipase are normal.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a systolic murmur, diminished radial and pedal pulses, and crackles in the anterior chest. He has also been found to have anemia, with a hemoglobin drop from 36% to 32%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complex, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac death.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and he may be at risk for further renal failure.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he may be at risk for further liver failure.

   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,

   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who has undergone cardiac catheterization and is currently in the ICU due to a likely STEMI, 3VD, and severe AS. He has been treated with IABP placement, nipride infusion, and lasix to reduce afterload and improve cardiac output. His cardiac index is low, and he has elevated filling pressures, indicating heart failure.

The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a low cardiac index and high systemic vascular resistance. He is at risk for further cardiac decompensation and potential complications such as:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's IABP placement and nipride infusion may increase the risk of cardiac tamponade, which could lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's elevated filling pressures and heart failure could lead to pulmonary edema, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and potential acute kidney injury from the nipride infusion could lead to further renal dysfunction and increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's indwelling lines and catheters increase his risk of sepsis, particularly if there is a breach in sterile technique or if he develops a line infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and IABP placement increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he develops a gastrointestinal bleed or a bleed at the IABP insertion site.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and potential pulmonary edema increase his risk of respiratory failure, which could worsen his overall condition and increase his risk of mortality.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's care team should closely monitor his hemodynamic status, cardiac output, and renal function. They should also maintain a high level of suspicion for potential complications and take prompt action to address any concerns that arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia

   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was found to have severe left main and three-vessel disease with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery. He underwent cardiac catheterization and was placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. He is planned for probable coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with possible aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair, or transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

The patient's current condition is complicated by tachycardia, hypertension, and heart failure with elevated filling pressures. His cardiac index is low, and he is being managed with a nipride drip and gentle diuresis to increase cardiac output while maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. His hemodynamics are being closely monitored, and he is at risk for cardiac complications such as cardiac tamponade, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's IABP placement and the presence of cardiac catheters increase the risk of cardiac tamponade.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and the presence of cardiac catheters increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low cardiac index and elevated filling pressures increase the risk of cardiogenic shock, which can be exacerbated by the presence of cardiac catheters and the use of vasopressors.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and the use of vasopressors and diuretics increase the risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and the presence of cardiac catheters increase the risk of respiratory failure, particularly if he develops cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
6. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU increases the risk of infection, particularly if he develops a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if he develops a gastrointestinal bleed or a retroperitoneal bleed.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemolysis and the presence of cardiac catheters increase the risk of anemia, which can exacerbate his cardiac condition.
9. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen if he develops a liver injury or if his liver function is impaired by the presence of cardiac catheters.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential medical complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or manage these complications and optimize his cardiac function."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in
   80
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in
   80
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male who presents several days out from likely STEMI, with severe 3VD and chronic RCA occlusion, and LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been placed on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. The patient's condition is being managed with metoprolol, heparin, atorvastatin, and lasix. He is experiencing tachycardia with SBPs in the 100s, but with low cardiac index. The plan is to continue afterload reduction with diuresis, IABP, and nipride gtt, and to focus on increasing cardiac index while keeping mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Continued LV dysfunction and dysfunction of the papillary muscles, which may lead to worsening CHF.
	* Potential for further cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
	* Risk of cardiac tamponade or perforation due to IABP placement.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
	* Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension, nephrotoxic medications, or underlying chronic kidney disease.
	* Risk of chronic kidney disease progression due to prolonged use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Hemolysis due to IABP placement, which may lead to anemia and decreased platelet count.
	* Risk of bleeding due to prolonged use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral edema or infarction due to hypotension, cardiac arrest, or other underlying conditions.
	* Risk of seizures or altered mental status due to electrolyte imbalances or medication side effects.
6. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial infections, such as pneumonia or catheter-related infections.
	* Risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as urinary tract infections or surgical site infections.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -BB held because of worsening hemodynamics.
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.  Will discuss
   possibility of surgery tomorrow instead as patient
s status tenuous.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -hold off on BB for now.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male who presents several days out from likely STEMI and has undergone catheterization showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been placed on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR. The patient has been started on low-dose Metoprolol, which was titrated up but caused worsening of CI and mixed venous sat. He has also been started on nicotine patch and has had a CT scan for pre-op, which showed IABP in place after transport.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His cardiac index is low, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is 56-61%. He has been diuresed overnight with good response and has had a CXR showing some crackles on lung exam. His LFTs are trending down, and his creatinine is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac tamponade due to IABP placement
	* Myocardial infarction or extension of existing infarction
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia
	* Cardiac failure or worsening of existing heart failure
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia
	* Respiratory failure or worsening of existing respiratory failure
	* Pulmonary edema or worsening of existing pulmonary edema
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury or worsening of existing chronic kidney disease
	* Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Hemolytic anemia or worsening of existing anemia
	* Thrombocytopenia or worsening of existing thrombocytopenia
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack
	* Seizures or worsening of existing seizures
	* Confusion or altered mental status
6. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock
	* Infection of the IABP or other medical devices
7. Other Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
	* Pancreatitis or worsening of existing pancreatitis
	* Liver failure or worsening of existing liver disease

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac function, and laboratory results to detect any potential complications early and initiate appropriate treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -BB held because of worsening hemodynamics.
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.  Will discuss
   possibility of surgery tomorrow instead as patient
s status tenuous.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -hold off on BB for now.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) who presents with suspected ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which showed 3-vessel disease (3VD) with chronic RCA occlusion and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

The patient has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for cardiogenic shock. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with a heart rate of 98 beats per minute (bpm) and a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg. The patient's cardiac index (CI) is 2.5 L/min/m2, and the mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 56-61%.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, nitroprusside, and furosemide, to manage his cardiogenic shock. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and his lactate level is 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.6-10.9 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct): 36.2-32.2%
* Platelet count: 188-150 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2-1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 4.12-2.80 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* LDH: 702 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 3.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): LV dysfunction, 4+ mitral regurgitation (MR), 3+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and significant aortic stenosis (AS)
* Coronary angiogram: 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion

The patient's plan is to undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with possible aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve repair (MVR), or tricuspid valve repair (TVR) on Monday morning.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: Given the patient's cardiogenic shock and LV dysfunction, there is a risk of cardiac arrest if the patient's hemodynamics deteriorate.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's lung function declines.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but there is a risk of renal failure if the patient's kidney function declines.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection, particularly with the IABP and PA catheter in place.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient is at risk of bleeding, particularly with the IABP and PA catheter in place.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is a risk of hypotension if the patient's vasopressor support is decreased.
7. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is stable, but there is a risk of tachycardia if the patient's hemodynamics deteriorate.
8. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is stable, but there is a risk of bradycardia if the patient's sinus node function declines.

Overall, the patient's condition is tenuous, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in
   80
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male who presented several days out from a likely STEMI and has been admitted to the ICU. He has undergone cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been placed on IABP and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, which has worsened since admission, and he has been treated with Lasix and nitroprusside.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His cardiac index is low, and he is tachycardic. He has a new systolic murmur, which is thought to be due to improvement in MR.

The patient's laboratory results show normal LFTs, with a slight elevation in LDH. His platelet count is normal, and his hemoglobin has decreased from 36 to 32. His creatinine level is stable.

The patient's plan is to continue diuresis, with a goal of gentle diuresis with standing 2x40mg IV Lasix. He will also continue to receive nitroprusside and IABP. His cardiac index will be monitored, and he will be followed for signs of hemolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemolysis: The patient's hemoglobin has decreased from 36 to 32, which may be due to hemolysis related to the IABP. Monitoring of platelet count and trend of hemoglobin will be necessary to rule out ongoing hemolysis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but it is unclear whether the failure is acute or chronic. Monitoring of creatinine level and urine output will be necessary to assess the patient's renal function.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac index is low, and he is tachycardic. Monitoring of cardiac index and hemodynamics will be necessary to assess the patient's cardiac function.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has pulmonary edema, which may worsen if not properly managed. Monitoring of oxygen saturation and pulmonary edema will be necessary to assess the patient's respiratory function.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly VAP, due to his prolonged ICU stay. Monitoring of temperature and white blood cell count will be necessary to assess the patient's risk for infection.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's LFTs are normal, but he has a history of transaminitis. Monitoring of LFTs and bilirubin will be necessary to assess the patient's liver function.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin has decreased, which may be due to hemolysis or bleeding. Monitoring of hemoglobin and platelet count will be necessary to assess the patient's anemia.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented several days out from likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has undergone catheterization showing 3-vessel disease with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery and has been diagnosed with left ventricular dysfunction, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. He has been placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's condition has worsened, with pulmonary edema showing moderate severity on chest X-ray. He has been treated with furosemide (Lasix) 40mg IV, with a goal of -2L, and has received an additional 40mg IV due to slowing urine output. His laboratory results show elevated troponin T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating ongoing myocardial damage.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 88bpm, blood pressure of 98/60mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals bilateral crackles at the bases, a systolic murmur at the apex, and diminished peripheral pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and decreased cardiac index suggest ongoing cardiac failure. Aggressive diuresis and afterload reduction may be necessary to improve cardiac function.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but his chronic kidney disease may worsen with ongoing cardiac failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral crackles and decreased lung compliance suggest ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.
4. Hemolytic anemia: The patient's decreased hematocrit and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) suggest ongoing hemolysis. Close monitoring of platelet count and hemoglobin levels is necessary.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and transaminitis suggest ongoing liver damage. Close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.
6. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing infection risk suggest a high risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and blood cultures is necessary.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy increase his risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of bleeding risk and platelet count is necessary.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to receive aggressive diuresis and afterload reduction to improve cardiac function. His IABP will be continued to facilitate recovery of the myocardium. He will be closely monitored for signs of cardiac failure, respiratory failure, hemolytic anemia, hepatic failure, sepsis, and bleeding complications. His laboratory results will be closely monitored, and his medication regimen will be adjusted as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male with a history of hypertension who presents several days out from likely STEMI. He has undergone catheterization showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been placed on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. His current condition is characterized by:

* Moderate pulmonary edema worsening since yesterday
* Normalized LFTs
* Normal methemoglobin level
* No known drug allergies
* Infusions of Heparin Sodium, Nitroprusside, and Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Other medications include Furosemide (Lasix), atorvastatin, and ASA

Vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 88 bpm (87-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 98/60 mmHg (76-122/54-102 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Physical examination:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 normal, III/VI systolic murmur at apex
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse present, left radial pulse present, right DP pulse diminished, left DP pulse diminished
* Respiratory/chest: Bilateral crackles at bases
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Warm and well-perfused, IABP access site clean, dry, and intact
* Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3

Lab results:

* WBC: 11.6-11.0 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 36.2-32.0%
* Plt: 98 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 1.2-1.0 mg/dL
* TropT: 4.12-2.80 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24-31 mmHg
* Glucose: 117-119 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.9/50.0/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 105/9/2.80, ALT/AST: 190/59, Alk Phos/T Bili: 130/0.5, Amylase/Lipase: 42/, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.4 g/dL, LDH: 525 IU/L, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's condition is characterized by worsening pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure and hypoxemia.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's LV dysfunction, 4+MR, and 3+TR can lead to cardiac failure, which can worsen his overall condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but he may be at risk for acute kidney injury due to cardiogenic shock and diuretic therapy.
4. Hemolysis: The patient's IABP may be causing hemolysis, which can lead to anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs are nearly normalized, but he may still be at risk for liver dysfunction due to shock and cardiogenic shock.
6. HTN: The patient's SBPs are in the 100s, which can worsen his cardiac condition and increase his risk of cardiac events.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and underlying cardiovascular disease.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue diuretic therapy to manage pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac index and adjust therapy as needed to optimize cardiac function.
4. Continue to follow the patient's lab results, including creatinine, Hct, and LFTs.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust therapy as needed to prevent bleeding.
6. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
7. Prepare the patient for surgery on Monday morning."

   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with a likely STEMI and was found to have 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and LV dysfunction. He has been treated with IABP placement, and is planned for CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR surgery on Monday morning. He has developed pulmonary edema, which has worsened since yesterday, and is receiving diuresis and IABP to reduce afterload. His cardiac index is low, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is 59-63%. He has anemia, which is likely related to hemolysis from the IABP, and his liver function tests are nearly normalized. He has chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine level has been stable. He has hypertension, which is being managed with medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac index is low, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation is 59-63%, indicating that he may be at risk for further cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema has worsened, and he is receiving diuresis and IABP to reduce afterload. He may be at risk for further respiratory failure if his cardiac function does not improve.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to hemolysis from the IABP, and may worsen if the IABP is not properly managed.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are nearly normalized, but he may be at risk for further liver dysfunction if his cardiac function does not improve.
5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine level has been stable. However, he may be at risk for further renal failure if his cardiac function does not improve.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with medication, but he may be at risk for further hypertension if his cardiac function does not improve.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pulmonary edema with diuresis and IABP.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
6. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with medication and monitor his response to treatment."

   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.

   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented with a likely STEMI several days ago. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He was placed on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. The patient is planned for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR. His current condition is hemodynamically stable with maps and pads unchanged, and he is receiving nitroprusside and heparin infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complex, with 3VD, chronic RCA occlusion, and significant AS. This increases the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has been stable, but his chronic kidney disease may worsen with further complications.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's Hct level has decreased, and he has elevated LDH levels, which may indicate hemolysis related to the IABP.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are nearly normalized, but he may still be at risk for further liver damage.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his cardiac condition and the use of invasive devices such as the IABP.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient has mild bilateral crackles on lung exam, which may worsen with further complications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's mental status is currently normal, but he may be at risk for neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac condition closely, and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin and platelet count, and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his treatment plan as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation. Goal negative 1 L today.
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow creatinine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male who presents with a history of hypertension and likely STEMI. He has undergone cardiac catheterization showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He is currently in the ICU with an IABP in place for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg, and SpO2 of 97%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals a mild systolic murmur at the apex, and his peripheral vascular examination shows diminished radial and digital pulses. His neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being alert and oriented.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 98 K/uL. His troponin-T levels are elevated at 4.12 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for likely CABG
* IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction
* Diuresis with Lasix to reduce afterload and improve cardiac index
* Inotropy or afterload reduction to increase cardiac index
* Monitoring of I/Os, UOP, and mentation
* Goal of negative 1 L of fluid today
* Follow-up of hemodynamics with Swan-Ganz catheter
* Monitoring of rhythm and heart rate
* Continuation of beta blockers with goal HR of 80-100

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications: worsening of LV dysfunction, development of cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac tamponade
* Respiratory complications: pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure
* Renal complications: acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances
* Hematological complications: bleeding complications, platelet dysfunction, and coagulopathy
* Infectious complications: sepsis, septic shock, and organ failure
* Neurological complications: stroke, seizure, and encephalopathy
* Gastrointestinal complications: bleeding, nausea, and vomiting

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting his treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation. Goal negative 1 L today.
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow creatinine.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.

   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing

   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does

   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been in the ICU for several days following a likely STEMI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR. His current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 97 bpm (84-101 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 115/58 mmHg (88-124/74-101 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute (18-30 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Cardiac index: 2.5 L/min/m2 (Fick method)

His laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 186 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 4.12 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24 mmHg
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complex, and he is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiac rupture.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but he has mild bilateral crackles at the bases of his lungs, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and he is at risk for infection, particularly given his immunosuppressed state.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's platelet count is normal, but his lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is elevated, which may indicate ongoing hemolysis.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are nearly normalized, but he may still be at risk for liver dysfunction given his cardiac condition.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he may be at risk for further anemia.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is stable, and his IABP and nipride drip are helping to reduce his afterload and improve his cardiac index. His diuresis is being continued to help manage his fluid status, and his goal is to be negative 1 L by the end of the day. His leukocytosis is being monitored, and his platelet count is being trended. His creatinine level is being followed, and his liver function tests are being monitored for signs of liver dysfunction. His anemia is being monitored, and his hemoglobin level is being trended."
