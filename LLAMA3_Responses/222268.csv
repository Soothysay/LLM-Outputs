   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established.
   - Enoxaparin 70mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis.
   - Hold diuretics
   - Uptitrate beta-blockers as tolerated by blood pressure
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea, vomitting resolved
   and patient taking POs
   - Hold off on IV fluids for now, but can consider 250cc boluses if
   urine output decreases.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and mild pancreatitis. She has been experiencing recurrent episodes of chest pain, with the most recent episode occurring overnight, which was relieved with nitro, morphine, and nitro paste.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has been treated with beta blockers and metoprolol. Her cardiac enzymes are trending upward, with a peak troponin level of 0.58 ng/mL. The patient has declined cardiac catheterization.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 112/68 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic CHF, chronic renal failure, and skin breakdown. She has been treated with various medications, including metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and enoxaparin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's mild pancreatitis can worsen and lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess formation, and sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure can worsen and lead to complications such as acute kidney injury, uremia, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown can worsen and lead to complications such as infection, sepsis, and osteomyelitis.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can worsen and lead to complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastritis and mild pancreatitis can worsen and lead to complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state can lead to infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg SC q24h for
   creatinine clearance < 30
   - cont lovenox as enzymes are trending up
   - ASA, Plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin
   - Trend biomarkers, telemetry, ECGs
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis. Uptitrated beta blockers yesterday.
   - Hold diuretics
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea, vomitting resolved
   and patient taking POs
   - Hold off on IV fluids for now, but can consider 250cc boluses if
   urine output decreases.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort and had multiple episodes of chest pain overnight, which were managed with beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but it is unclear whether it is related to NSTEMI or demand ischemia due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has declined cardiac catheterization.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may exacerbate her underlying cardiac condition, leading to further cardiac decompensation or arrhythmias.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's mildly elevated lipase and amylase levels suggest mild pancreatitis, which may progress to more severe pancreatitis if not managed properly.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed apparent coccygeal breakdown, which may lead to further skin breakdown and potential infection if not managed properly.
4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and the elevated creatinine levels may indicate worsening kidney function.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic CHF may lead to worsening respiratory failure, especially if not managed properly.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastritis and mild pancreatitis may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
7. Infection: The patient's mild pancreatitis and skin breakdown may increase the risk of infection, which may lead to sepsis and further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent further cardiac complications.
2. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and biomarkers to assess the severity of her cardiac condition.
3. Manage the patient's pancreatitis and gastritis with appropriate medications and fluids.
4. Monitor the patient's skin breakdown and provide wound care as needed.
5. Continue cardiac medications, such as beta blockers and diuretics, to manage the patient's cardiac condition.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed.
7. Provide respiratory support as needed to manage the patient's chronic systolic CHF.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and provide supportive care as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg SC q24h for
   creatinine clearance < 30

   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  [**Month (only) 11**] be
   exacerbated by hypovolemia in setting of gastritis and mild
   pancreatitis. Uptitrated beta blockers yesterday.
   - restart diuretic
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild
   pancreatitis.  Patient does not appear to be third spacing.  Unclear
   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.
   - Hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea, vomitting resolved
   and patient taking POs
   - Hold off on IV fluids for now, but can consider 250cc boluses if
   urine output decreases.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort, which was initially thought to be related to ST segment deviations possibly due to old infarcts. However, the recurrent episode of chest pain, which resolved with metoprolol, suggests a possible contribution from atrial fibrillation with RVR. The patient's troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization, and anticoagulation will be continued until more definitive trends for troponins can be established.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may exacerbate her underlying cardiac condition, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even sudden cardiac death.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's mildly elevated lipase and amylase levels suggest mild pancreatitis, which may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or even renal failure.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's apparent coccygeal breakdown may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as infection, sepsis, or even death.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic CHF may lead to respiratory complications such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's mild pancreatitis and gastritis may increase her risk of developing infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response in setting of likely mild pancreatitis.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episode at 3:30PM
   occurred in setting of heart rate of 115 and resolved with metoprolol
   5mg IV x 2, which reduced heart rate to 70s.  Troponin elevation may be
   related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus
   NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the
   same level during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue
   anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be
   established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg SC q24h for
   creatinine clearance < 30

   - restart diuretic
   - continue BB at current dose, consider uptitration as tolerated
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Nausea/vomitting: Slightly elevated lipase and amylase suggests mild

   precipitant, medications vs. gallstones.  Alkaline phosphatase is
   negative suggesting against biliary tree source.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Overnight events of chest pain and Afib with rapid ventricular response
   noted.
   Physical Examination
   JVP remains elevated but less distended. Lungs clear,
   Diffuse PMI, parasternal lift, [**3-15**] harsh AS murmur radiating to neck
   with murmur also headr at apex and subxiphoid space that is more
   blowing in charcater and increases with inspiration consistent with TR
   and MR.
   Medical Decision Making
   Concerned with ongoing symptoms of chest pain. There are multiple
   potential supply and demand issues, including rapid Afib, increased
   filling pressures limiting perfusion and increasing wall stress, and
   very likely significnt lesion of one or both remaining vein grafts. She
   continues to refuse cardiac cath but is amenable to other therapies
   short of resuscitation or intubation. Will continue very gentle

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and mild pancreatitis. She presented with chest discomfort in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has had multiple episodes of chest pain, with one episode occurring in the context of afib with RVR, which improved with beta blockade and nitro. Repeat EKGs demonstrated no evidence of ST elevations but showed some ST-T wave changes.

The patient has been started on lovenox with 70mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30. The plan is to continue anticoagulation until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. The patient has refused cardiac cath, and the plan is to readdress this.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which may be exacerbated by hypovolemia in the setting of gastritis and mild pancreatitis. The plan is to restart diuretic, continue beta blockers at current dose, and consider uptitration as tolerated.

The patient has nausea and vomiting, which may be related to mild pancreatitis. The plan is to hold furosemide 40mg for now, restart once nausea and vomiting resolve, and patient is taking POs.

The patient has chronic systolic CHF, with leg edema at baseline and no change in dyspnea. The plan is to continue lisinopril and beta blockers, with a goal of I/O negative -500cc per day.

The patient has chronic renal failure, which is stable. The patient has skin breakdown, with apparent coccygeal breakdown, which is being managed with wound care consult not necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's mild pancreatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as abscess formation, sepsis, or pancreatic duct obstruction.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic CHF may lead to respiratory complications such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to complications such as acute kidney injury, uremia, or electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infections: The patient's skin breakdown may lead to infections such as cellulitis, abscesses, or sepsis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's severe coronary artery disease may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or sudden death.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She presented with chest discomfort and was initially treated with beta blockers, but her blood pressure was not high enough to tolerate this. She responded well to nitroglycerin drip and morphine sulfate IV. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and has limited treatment options. She has been started on lovenox and continues to receive anticoagulation therapy. The patient has chronic systolic CHF, chronic renal failure, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation with RVR, leading to increased risk of stroke and heart failure.
2. Development of ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition.
3. Progression of chronic renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease.
4. Skin breakdown and wound infections, particularly in the presence of coccygeal breakdown.
5. Nausea and vomiting, potentially leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastritis and mild pancreatitis, potentially leading to complications such as bleeding, infection, or organ failure.
7. Hypovolemia, potentially leading to decreased cardiac output and organ dysfunction.
8. Decreased tolerance to beta blockers, potentially leading to hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
9. Development of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, due to the patient's underlying cardiopulmonary condition.
10. Decreased mobility and increased risk of falls, potentially leading to injuries and complications."

   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been experiencing chest discomfort and has been treated with metoprolol, Imdur, and Lovenox. Her blood pressure has been borderline, and she has been experiencing hypotension. She has also been experiencing nausea and vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been borderline, and she has been experiencing hypotension, which can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of stroke, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain can be a sign of ongoing ischemia or infarction, which can lead to further cardiac damage and potential complications.
4. Skin Breakdown: The patient has apparent coccygeal breakdown, which can lead to infection and potential sepsis.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure or pneumonia.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine clearance is <30, and she is at risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's severe coronary artery disease and systolic CHF make her at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or cardiac arrest.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medications as necessary to maintain optimal blood pressure.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust medications as necessary to control the rhythm.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's chest pain and adjust medications as necessary to manage the discomfort.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and provide wound care as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as necessary to manage the creatinine clearance.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and provide anti-nausea medications as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as necessary to manage the cardiac complications."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Recurrent episodes of chest pain, some of which are atypical for usual
   ischemic pain.
   Physical Examination
   HR 120s.
   JVP >16 with prominent v wave
   AS and TR murmurs
   Medical Decision Making
   Improving. Rate control remains an issue as does borderline hypotension
   Will increase metoprolol to 25 mg tid; Continue oral nitrates together
   with other heart failure regimen as recorded above.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Goal 500-1L negative. Will resume home dose lasix of
   40mg PO daily.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day
   .

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Recurrent episodes of chest pain, some of which are atypical for usual
   ischemic pain.
   Physical Examination
   HR 120s.
   JVP >16 with prominent v wave
   AS and TR murmurs
   Medical Decision Making
   Improving. Rate control remains an issue as does borderline hypotension
   Will increase metoprolol to 25 mg tid; Continue oral nitrates together
   with other heart failure regimen as recorded above.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort, which may be related to old-infarcts, atrial fibrillation with RVR, or NSTEMI.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including metoprolol, Imdur, Lovenox, and morphine, but has refused atorvastatin and cardiac catheterization. She has also refused wound care and lying on her side, which may be contributing to her skin breakdown.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.7°C, Tcurrent 36.6°C, HR 86 bpm, BP 92/49 mmHg, RR 13 inspirations per minute, SpO2 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 cm, and her pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) is 25 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,680 mL of fluids, including 160 mL of IV fluids, 100 mL of PO fluids, and 8 mL of IV fluids.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 L/min.
* Laboratory results: The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.36 ng/mL, and her creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further cardiac decompensation due to atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
* Worsening of skin breakdown and potential development of pressure ulcers.
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
* Potential development of sepsis or septic shock due to skin breakdown and potential infection.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue rate control measures, including metoprolol and digoxin, to optimize heart rate and reduce the risk of cardiac decompensation.
* Continue anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox and consider switching to heparin SC when stopped.
* Continue diuresis to reduce preload, afterload, and wall stress, and to improve cardiac function.
* Consider ranolazine and fentanyl patch for improved chest pain regimen in the setting of end-stage CAD.
* Monitor the patient's skin breakdown and consider wound care consult if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or mechanical ventilation if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including troponin and creatinine clearance, to assess for potential complications.
* Consider cardiology consultation for further management and guidance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV.
   Troponin elevation may be related to demand in setting of atrial
   fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.  Likely former, since CPK is
   stable near 400, which was the same level during her last admission.
   Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation until more definitive trend
   for troponins can be established. Patient started on lovenox with 70mg
   SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30
   - continue lovenox

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She has been experiencing chest discomfort and was initially treated with beta blockers, but due to hypotension, the dose was reduced to 50mg PO BID. She has also been started on Imdur for CP prophylaxis and Lovenox for anticoagulation. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to mild pancreatitis. She has been treated with NTG drip and MS IV, and her troponin levels are elevated, which may be related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR or NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of stroke, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased oral intake, which may further exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's mild pancreatitis may worsen, leading to increased pancreatic enzymes, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown may worsen, leading to increased risk of infection, wound complications, and prolonged hospitalization.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to increased risk of electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased risk of respiratory arrest, pneumonia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may occur, leading to potentially life-threatening complications and decreased cardiac output.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust her medications as needed, and provide supportive care to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload

   ischemia and CP.  Goal 500-1L negative. Will resume home dose lasix of

   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is experiencing chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her creatinine levels have increased, and she has been started on lovenox due to creatinine clearance < 30. She has refused cardiac catheterization and is intolerant to beta blockers due to hypotension. Her current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrest or stroke.
	* Coronary artery disease may cause further myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
2. Renal complications:
	* Increased creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
	* Lovenox may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or aspiration pneumonia.
4. Skin breakdown:
	* Coccygeal breakdown may lead to infection, pain, or discomfort.
5. Respiratory complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Medication-related complications:
	* Metoprolol may cause hypotension, bradycardia, or bronchospasm.
	* Lisinopril may cause angioedema, hyperkalemia, or hypotension.
	* Lasix may cause electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, or ototoxicity.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, lab results, and medication regimen to prevent or manage potential complications."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continued frequent angina
   Physical Examination
   BP 90s; HR 90-100
   Marked JVP elevation with prominent v wave.
   Medical Decision Making
   Difficulty controlling rate due to hypotension.
   creatinine elevation in setting of diuresis and ACE inhibitor - on hold
   and anemia.
   She continues to refuse cardiac cath.
   Will begin around the clock narcotic analgesics.
   Consider ranolazine.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - Trial of ranolazine today, monitor QTc.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
   # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
   # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Continued frequent angina
   Physical Examination
   BP 90s; HR 90-100
   Marked JVP elevation with prominent v wave.
   Medical Decision Making
   Difficulty controlling rate due to hypotension.
   creatinine elevation in setting of diuresis and ACE inhibitor - on hold
   and anemia.
   She continues to refuse cardiac cath.
   Will begin around the clock narcotic analgesics.
   Consider ranolazine.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort and was treated with NTG drip and MS IV, but her BP was limited by hypotension. Her troponin elevation is likely related to demand in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI. She has been started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.

The patient's current medications include ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose), and ACEI on hold due to elevated creatinine. She has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a palliative approach. Her current condition includes:

* Chest pain
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Elevated creatinine
* Anemia
* Low urine output
* Peripheral edema
* Stage II sacral decubitus
* Elevation of JVP

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leading to further cardiac decompensation.
2. Increased risk of bleeding due to continued anticoagulation with lovenox.
3. Further decline in renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury.
4. Increased risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to immobility and poor nutrition.
5. Potential for further cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiac arrest, due to ongoing ischemia and decreased cardiac output.
6. Increased risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, due to prolonged immobility and decreased lung function.
7. Potential for further anemia, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of cardiac complications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust treatment as needed to control the rate and rhythm.
2. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox until more definitive trend for troponins can be established.
3. Monitor the patient's creatinine clearance and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further decline in renal function.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's skin and prevent further skin breakdown.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further cardiac complications.
6. Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of end-stage CAD.
7. Trial of ranolazine today, monitor QTc.
8. Continue ASA, Plavix, and statin at reduced dose.
9. Hold ACEI until creatinine clearance improves.
10. Consider PRBCs for improved O2 delivery and decreased angina."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - Trial of ranolazine today, monitor QTc.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
   # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
   # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with recurrent episodes of chest pain, which may be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or old-infarcts. She has been treated with beta-blockers, nitrates, and morphine, but has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a more palliative approach. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which may be related to demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, leading to increased risk of stroke or cardiac arrest.
2. Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to the use of beta-blockers and nitrates.
3. Development of cardiac tamponade or pericarditis due to the use of anticoagulants.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors.
5. Worsening of anemia due to ongoing blood loss or decreased red blood cell production.
6. Increased risk of skin breakdown due to poor wound care and decreased mobility.
7. Development of respiratory failure due to decreased lung function or pneumonia.
8. Increased risk of sepsis or septic shock due to infection or decreased immune function.
9. Development of acute kidney injury due to decreased perfusion or increased nephrotoxicity.
10. Increased risk of cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death due to underlying coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.

Plan:

1. Continue rate control measures, including increasing beta-blockers to 37.5 tid.
2. Monitor troponin levels and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
3. Continue diuresis to reduce preload, afterload, and wall stress.
4. Consider fentanyl patch for improved pain control.
5. Monitor QTc and adjust ranolazine therapy as necessary.
6. Continue digoxin therapy and monitor levels.
7. Offer PRBCs for improved O2 delivery and decreased angina.
8. Continue wound care consult and monitor skin breakdown.
9. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and sepsis.
10. Monitor for signs of acute kidney injury and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can arise:

Summary:

The patient, who has been admitted to the ICU, continues to experience nausea and vomiting despite being treated with Zofran. The patient refused Reglan, which may have contributed to the persistence of nausea. The patient's creatinine level has increased, leading to the discontinuation of Lisinopril. The patient has also experienced chest pain, which was treated with morphine. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with the exception of a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's persistent nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition, which can further compromise the patient's overall health.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of chest pain may indicate cardiac damage, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's increasing creatinine level and discontinuation of Lisinopril may indicate acute kidney injury, which can lead to further renal dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and possible cardiac damage may increase the risk of pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory failure.
5. Infection Complications: The patient's history of antibiotics and possible cardiac damage may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate may indicate hemodynamic instability, which can lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening situations.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount, will try 25 Q8 hours metoprolol in order
   to optimize.
   - continue lovenox
   - ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, refusing atorvastatin
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization
   - Continue imdur
   - Consider ranolazine, fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in
   setting of end-stage CAD.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload

   ischemia and CP.  Goal 500-1L negative. Will resume home dose lasix of
   40mg PO daily.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue lisinopril, BB
   - diruesis with goal I /o negative -500 cc per day

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort, which was initially treated with beta blockers but was limited by hypotension. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, and her creatinine levels have increased, leading to the discontinuation of lisinopril. She has also developed peripheral edema and has been treated with diuretics. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, but her troponin levels are stable, suggesting a possible former NSTEMI. She has refused cardiac catheterization and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even sudden cardiac death.
2. Renal complications: The patient's increasing creatinine levels and discontinuation of lisinopril may lead to further kidney damage or even acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic CHF may lead to worsening respiratory failure, especially if her diuretic therapy is not optimized.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or even gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown, particularly in the coccygeal area, may lead to further complications, such as infection or sepsis.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and elevated cardiac enzymes may increase her risk of thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and skin breakdown may increase her risk of infection, particularly in the skin and soft tissues.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities make her at high risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and optimization of her treatment plan are essential to prevent or manage these complications and improve her clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.
    FEN:  Low-sodium heart healthy diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:  Therapeutic enoxaparin for now, switch to heparin SC
   tomorrow.
   CODE: DNR/DNI, follow up palliative care reccomendations

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presented with chest discomfort and was initially treated with beta blockers, but her blood pressure was not high enough to tolerate the medication. She was later treated with nitroglycerin and morphine, but her chest pain persisted. Her troponin levels were elevated, but it is unclear whether this is due to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or demand ischemia. She has been started on anticoagulation therapy with lovenox and is being managed with a palliative approach.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued ischemia and chest pain due to inadequate treatment or progression of disease
	* Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
	* Potential for cardiac arrest or sudden death
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility
	* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy or underlying gastrointestinal disease
	* Increased risk of gastrointestinal complications due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility
4. Neurological complications:
	* Increased risk of neurological complications due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
	* Potential for stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
5. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased perfusion or underlying kidney disease
	* Increased risk of AKI due to anticoagulation therapy or underlying kidney disease
6. Infectious complications:
	* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility
	* Potential for sepsis or septic shock
7. Skin breakdown:
	* Continued skin breakdown due to inadequate wound care or underlying skin disease
	* Increased risk of skin breakdown due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort and has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine. Her pain and nausea have improved with the use of MS Contin and breakthrough pain medications. She has also been started on lovenox for anticoagulation.

The patient has a history of non-intervenable coronary disease and has declined cardiac catheterization. She has been prescribed a palliative approach and has been seen by palliative care. Her condition has been stabilized, and she has been transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is a potential complication that may lead to further cardiac issues.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen if her condition is not managed properly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if her creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's coccygeal breakdown may worsen if she does not receive proper wound care.
5. Anemia: The patient's persistent low Hct may worsen if she does not receive adequate transfusions.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment.
7. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly in her PICC line and IV lines.
9. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and other medications.
10. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis if she develops an infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and adjust her medications as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac failure with diuretics and other medications.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medications as needed.
4. Continue to provide wound care to the patient's coccygeal breakdown.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and provide transfusions as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's gastrointestinal issues with antiemetics and other medications.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
8. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
9. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
10. Continue to provide education to the patient and her family on her condition and treatment plan."

   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload

   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, she poorly tolerates anti-anginal treatment due to borderline
   BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  will increase BB to 37.5 TID today.
   - last dose lovenox tonight.
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Consider fentanyl patch for improved CP regimen in setting of
   end-stage CAD. For now will try long acting oral morphine for improved
   pain control.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitrate beta blockers as above.
   - diuresis to reduce preload
 afterload
 wall stress
 demand
   ischemia and CP.  Low UOP, inc cr and elevated K overnight. Hold lasix
   for today, use as needed for goal fluid even.
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, d/c lovenox tonight.
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, will
   offer PRBCs for improved 02 delivery/decreased angina. Give with lasix
   as needed.
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort and has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, nitrates, and morphine. Her troponin levels are elevated, but her CPK levels are stable, suggesting a possible former NSTEMI. The patient has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a palliative approach.

The patient's pain and nausea have improved with the use of MS Contin and breakthrough PO pain medications. Her bowel regimen has been increased, and she is willing to take bowel meds and heparin SQ. Her appetite has also improved.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 81/39 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. Her heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels, but her CPK levels are stable. Her creatinine clearance is less than 30, and she has been started on lovenox. Her platelet count is 61,000/μL, and her hemoglobin is 8.6 g/dL.

The patient's plan includes increasing her beta blockers to 37.5 TID, holding off on ranolazine, and considering a fentanyl patch for improved pain control. She will continue to receive anticoagulation with lovenox until more definitive trends for troponins can be established. Her cardiac catheterization has been refused, and she prefers a palliative approach.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic CHF can lead to respiratory complications such as pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting can lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
4. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine clearance is less than 30, and she has been started on lovenox, which can increase the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation with lovenox can increase the risk of bleeding complications such as hematomas, epistaxis, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Skin breakdown: The patient's apparent coccygeal breakdown can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
7. Anemia: The patient's persistent low hemoglobin can lead to anemia and decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues.
8. Infection: The patient's chronic systolic CHF and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can increase the risk of infection such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or sepsis."

   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for

   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo female with severe coronary artery disease, systolic CHF presents
   with chest discomfort in setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid
   ventricular response.
   # Chest pain:  ST segment deviations may have been related to
   old-infarcts and changes have now resolved.  Some contribution related
   to Atrial fibrillation with RVR, given that recurrent episodes
   associated with CP. Initially treated with Bblockers but SBPs have not
   been high enough to tolerate this. Did well with NTG drip and MS IV,
   limited again by hypotension. Troponin elevation may be related to
   demand in setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR versus NSTEMI.
   Likely former, since CPK is stable near 400, which was the same level
   during her last admission.  Nevertheless, will continue anticoagulation
   until more definitive trend for troponins can be established. Patient
   started on lovenox with 80mg SC q24h for creatinine clearance < 30.
   Essentially this is a patient with end-stage, non-intervenable coronary
   disease, also patient declines cardiac cath, she poorly tolerates
   anti-anginal treatment due to borderline BPs.
   - Rate control is tantamount,  increased BB to 37.5 TID, rate
   well-controlled with this.
   - last dose lovenox [**2-18**].
   - ASA, Plavix, statin (lowered dose per pt request). ACEI on hold for
   elevated cr.
   - patient has refused cardiac catherization, prefers more palliative
   approach.
   - palliative care consulted, appreciate their recs
   - Pt does not appear to be getting significant benefit from imdur, will
   d/c to give room on BP to increase BB.
   - Started on MS contin yesterday with very good effect.
   - held off on ranolazine given that starting long acting morphine.
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   Uptitratde beta blockers as above.
   - Cont. BB as above
   - Continue digoxin, level appropriate at 1.0
   - pt refusing long term anticoagulation, completed lovenox x 3days for
   ACS
   # Chronic systolic CHF - Leg edema is at baseline and patient is not
   any more dyspneic than baseline.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Elevated JVP
   may be secondary to tricuspid regurgitation.
   - Continue BB, ACEI on hold for inc cr.
   - goal fluid even.
    # Anemia
 pt with persistent low hct.  Given ongoing angina, was
   transfused yesterday without appropriate bump.
   -Transfuse additional unit pRBCs today
   - Cont. to follow Hct
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr bumped from 1.5->2.5 yesterday.
   Felt to be [**2-11**] pre-renal etiology, diuresis and CHF.  Cr stable today.
   - Given blood for volume today
   - Holding lasix and ACE
   - Cont. to follow
    # Skin breakdown
 patient with apparent coccygeal breakdown as per
   nursing.  Patient refused wound care bed or lying on her side instead.
   As per nursing wound care consult not necessary.  OOB today.
    FEN:  Low-sodium heart healthy diet
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:  heparin SC, PPI, bowel regimen
   CODE: DNR/DNI, follow up palliative care reccomendations, patient
   considering home with hospice

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 71-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with severe coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She presents with chest discomfort, which may be related to old-infarcts, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or NSTEMI. The patient has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, nitroglycerin, and morphine, but has poor tolerance due to borderline blood pressure. She has refused cardiac catheterization and prefers a palliative approach.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved pain and nausea control on MS Contin. Her appetite has improved, and she is willing to take bowel medications and heparin injections. However, she has refused wound care and is experiencing skin breakdown.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or stroke.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure can worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremia.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown can lead to further complications, such as infection, sepsis, or osteomyelitis.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic systolic congestive heart failure can lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic anemia can lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state can increase her risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
7. DVT or PE: The patient's immobility and chronic illness can increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), which can lead to further complications.
8. Medication-related complications: The patient's multiple medications can interact with each other, leading to adverse effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."
