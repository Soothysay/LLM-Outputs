   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5118**] is an 85 yo male with CAD s/p MI, CVA, now with lower GI
   bleed for 4 days requiring 13 units of PRBCs.
   .
   1. GI bleed.  Patient admitted with ongoing lower GI bleed.  Initial
   bleeding scan at OSH on [**10-17**] revealed right sided bleeding, however
   colonoscopy x 2 failed to identify source of bleeding but there was
   concern for AVMs versus divertular bleed versus bleed proximal to the
   ileocecal valve.  Currenly hemodynamically stable with ongoing
   bleeding.  Will pursue tagged RBC today and then proceed to angiography
   versus surgery.
   - serial Hcts (q4 hours)
   - right IJ from OSH --> will need to replace in AM
   - type and cross 2 units
   - tagged RBCs today
   - Surgery consult given extent of bleed
   - GI consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], though less likely to be upper bleed
   .
   2.  CAD.  Patient has history of CAD with EF of 45%.  Cardiac cath in
   [**2118**] showed 3 vessel disease.  No history of stents per patient.  On
   Aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home.  However,
   given extensive bleed, will avoid antiplatelet therapy and
   antihypertesnives.  Got DDAVP at OSH.
   - continue atorvastatin, zetia
   - hold BB, lasix, isosorbide mononitrate
   - hold aspirin
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30 given CAD and active bleed
   - check EKG
   .
   3.  H/o stroke.  Patient has history of CVA.  However, given
   significant and prolonged bleed, will hold aggrenox.
   - hold agrenox
   4.  FEN: IVF @ 150cc/hour, NPO for now.
   5. PPx: pneumoboots.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, MI, and CVA, who was admitted with a lower GI bleed that has been ongoing for 4 days. He has received 13 units of PRBCs. The initial bleeding scan revealed right-sided bleeding, but colonoscopy failed to identify the source. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but ongoing bleeding is a concern. The plan is to pursue tagged RBCs today and then proceed to angiography or surgery.

The patient has a history of CAD with an EF of 45%, and cardiac catheterization showed 3-vessel disease. He is currently taking atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home, but will avoid antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensives due to the extensive bleed.

The patient also has a history of stroke, but will hold Aggrenox due to the significant and prolonged bleed.

The patient is currently receiving IVF at 150cc/hour, and is NPO. He has a multi-lumen line inserted and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's ongoing lower GI bleed is a significant concern, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock, acidosis, and other complications.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's hemodynamic instability and ongoing bleeding increase the risk of developing hypovolemic shock, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and his underlying medical conditions increase his risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and MI increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but his underlying medical conditions and prolonged stay in the ICU increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and his current medical condition increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications and ensure his overall well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5118**] is an 85 yo male with CAD s/p MI, CVA, now with lower GI
   bleed for 4 days requiring 13 units of PRBCs.
   1. GI bleed.  Patient admitted with ongoing lower GI bleed.  Initial
   bleeding scan at OSH on [**10-17**] revealed right sided bleeding, however
   colonoscopy x 2 failed to identify source of bleeding but there was
   concern for AVMs versus divertular bleed versus bleed proximal to the
   ileocecal valve.  Currenly hemodynamically stable with ongoing
   bleeding.  Will pursue tagged RBC today and then proceed to angiography
   versus surgery.
   - serial Hcts (q4 hours)
   - right IJ from OSH --> will need to replace in AM
   - type and cross 2 units
   - tagged RBCs today
   - Surgery consult given extent of bleed
   - GI consult
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], though less likely to be upper bleed
   .
   2.  CAD.  Patient has history of CAD with EF of 45%.  Cardiac cath in
   [**2118**] showed 3 vessel disease.  No history of stents per patient.  On
   Aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home.  However,
   given extensive bleed, will avoid antiplatelet therapy and
   antihypertesnives.  Got DDAVP at OSH.
   - continue atorvastatin, zetia
   - hold BB, lasix, isosorbide mononitrate
   - hold aspirin
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30 given CAD and active bleed
   - check EKG
   .
   3.  H/o stroke.  Patient has history of CVA.  However, given
   significant and prolonged bleed, will hold aggrenox.
   - hold agrenox

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of CAD, CVA, and now experiencing a lower GI bleed that has required 13 units of PRBCs. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but continues to bleed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/100 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on room air, and they are receiving respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination reveals right facial droop, EOMI, and clear oropharyngeal examination. The cardiovascular examination is normal, with a regular rhythm and no murmurs or gallop. The pulmonary examination reveals bilateral chest tenderness.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a total count of 112 K/μL. The patient's platelet count is 106 K/μL, and their hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 23 mEq/L, and their creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of the GI bleed, with plans for tagged RBCs and angiography or surgery. The patient is also being managed for CAD, with a history of three-vessel disease and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. The patient is being treated with aspirin, lasix, atorvastatin, zetia, and metoprolol at home, but will avoid antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensive medications due to the extensive bleed. The patient is also being managed for a history of stroke, with a hold on aggrenox.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's GI bleed has been ongoing for four days, and there is a risk of continued bleeding and potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the GI bleed and the presence of a nasogastric tube.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent MI make them at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest potential kidney damage, and there is a risk of further kidney damage due to the patient's ongoing bleed and fluid management.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support and potential for further bleeding make them at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and potential for further bleeding make them at risk for neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive decline."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

The patient, an 85-year-old male, has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed. He has a history of CAD, CVA, and has undergone 13 units of PRBC transfusions. The patient has ongoing lower GI bleeding, which has been difficult to identify the source of bleeding. The tagged RBC scan was negative, but the patient is still bleeding. The plan is to perform a total colectomy today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 137/100 mmHg, and SpO2 of 100%. His respiratory support is provided with oxygen therapy, and his ABG results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals right facial droop, EOMI, and soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. He has peripheral edema and a history of CAD with an EF of 45%.

The patient's lab results show:

* Hb: 112 g/L
* Hct: 31.9%
* Plt: 106 x 10^9/L
* WBC: 9.4 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 128 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/32.9/1.3, ALT/AST: 17/39, Alk Phos/T Bili: 37/1.2, Differential-Neuts: 74.9%, Lymph: 18.7%, Mono: 5.0%, Eos: 1.2%, Albumin: 2.4 g/dL, LDH: 270 IU/L, Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* GI bleed: serial Hcts (q4 hours), right IJ from OSH, transfuse 2 units, await surgical intervention, and cardiac consult for clearance.
* CAD: continue atorvastatin and zetia, hold BB, lasix, isosorbide mononitrate, and aspirin, transfuse to keep Hct > 30, and cardiac consult for clearance.
* H/o stroke: hold aggrenox.
* FEN: IVF @ 150cc/hour, NPO for now.
* PPx: pneumoboots.
* FULL CODE, confirmed with patient.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding due to ongoing lower GI bleed
* Cardiac complications due to CAD and active bleeding
* Renal failure due to decreased perfusion and fluid overload
* Respiratory failure due to fluid overload and cardiac compromise
* Sepsis due to ongoing bleeding and potential infections
* Worsening of peripheral edema and potential development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed. He was initially admitted to another hospital with BRBPR and was transfused with 13 units of PRBCs. A tagged RBC scan showed bleeding localized to the ascending colon, and colonoscopy revealed several right-sided AVMs and scattered diverticuli. The AVMs were cauterized, but the patient continued to bleed, and repeat colonoscopy showed cauterized ulcers, not bleeding.

The patient has been receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and has a history of CAD with 3VD and EF 45%, for which he underwent POBA. He is currently on statin and zetia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 111/76 mmHg, and SpO2 of 100%. His respiratory support is limited to nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 29.2 g/dL, a platelet count of 112 K/uL, and a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL. His liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 17 IU/L and an AST of 39 IU/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. GI bleed: The patient is still bleeding despite cauterization of AVMs, suggesting that the bleed may be from another source, possibly diverticuli. The plan is to transfuse 2 units of PRBCs, crossmatch additional 2 units, and discuss with Surgery whether to go to the OR, perform angiography, or continue supportive care with transfusions.
2. Hx CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone POBA. He is currently holding aspirin and metoprolol due to bleeding. A cardiology consult is planned for preoperative evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction
* Infection, which can be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state
* Cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, given the patient's history of CAD
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, given the patient's respiratory support and potential for aspiration
* Hepatic dysfunction, given the patient's mildly elevated liver enzymes
* Renal dysfunction, given the patient's potential for fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: GI bleed
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Fellow for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   85 yo male admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-17**] with BRBPR.  Initial Hct there
   31, transfused, hemodynamically stable.  Got tagged RBC scan there
   which showed bleeding localized to ascending colon.  Colonoscopy showed
   several R-sided AVMs and scattered diverticuli, no active bleeding.
   AVMs were cauterized.  Bleeding appears to have stopped temporarily
   after that, but then he rebled.  Got repeat colonoscopy which showed
   cauterized ulcers, not bleeding.  Received 13U PRBCs total while there,
   transferred here for possible surgery.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, requiring 13 units of blood transfusion. The bleeding was localized to the ascending colon, and colonoscopy showed several right-sided arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scattered diverticuli. The AVMs were cauterized, but the patient continued to bleed. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 35.7°C, T-current 35.7°C, HR 89 bpm, BP 111/76 mmHg, RR 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is hemodynamically stable.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 900 mL of fluids and has a total output of 340 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 31.9 g/dL to 29.2 g/dL, and his platelet count has decreased from 112 K/uL to 106 K/uL.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Continued bleeding from the ascending colon, which may lead to further blood loss and hypovolemic shock.
* Development of coagulopathy due to the patient's low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's decreased blood volume and potential hypovolemic shock.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the patient's respiratory support and potential aspiration of gastric contents.
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, due to the patient's underlying coronary artery disease and potential electrolyte imbalances.
* Infection, such as sepsis or septic shock, due to the patient's invasive lines and potential bacterial contamination.

The plan of care includes transfusing 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and cross-matching additional 2 units, as well as discussing the possibility of surgery with the patient's surgical team. The patient's cardiovascular medications will be continued, and a cardiology consult will be obtained for potential preoperative evaluation."
