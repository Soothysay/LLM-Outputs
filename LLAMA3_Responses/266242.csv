   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access, currently has Cordis in place, will check
   position on CXR. Also has two 18 gage PIV's.
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   Suspect will likely repeat endoscopy and/or tagged RBC scan.
   Appreciate assistance from GI, surgery, and IR teams. If continues to
   have melena (had one episode on arrival) may need to go directly to
   angio.
   - Type and screen, cross match 4 units
   - Attempting to get copy of tagged RBC scan study from [**Hospital1 872**].
   - IV PPI drip
   - Monitor HCT Q6-8, transfuse for dropping HCT
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue amiodarone drip for now.
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - IV PPI drip
   - No need for VAP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - No need for VAP
   #) Code: Full
   #) Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] would not provide any family or friend
   contacts in event of emergency.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who was transferred from another hospital for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient's current condition is:

* Hemodynamically stable in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 93 bpm
* Soft abdomen with active bowel sounds and no tenderness
* Hemoglobin (Hb) level of 24.0 g/dL, which is unchanged from admission
* White blood cell (WBC) count of 6.4 K/uL, which is elevated
* Platelet count of 140 K/uL, which is normal
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 109 mg/dL, which is elevated
* Creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, which is normal
* Glucose level of 99 mg/dL, which is normal
* Electrolyte levels are within normal range

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Fentanyl and midazolam for pain and anxiety management
* Diazepam (Valium) for anxiety management
* Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GI bleed prophylaxis
* Thiamine and folate for alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis
* Metoprolol as needed for atrial fibrillation management

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Continued bleeding from the GI tract, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure
* Development of atrial fibrillation-related complications, such as stroke or systemic embolism
* Progression of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which could lead to seizures, hallucinations, or other life-threatening complications
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications
* Infection, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust medications as necessary
* Repeat angio if the patient continues to bleed
* Consider further management of the patient's atrial fibrillation, such as cardioversion or anticoagulation therapy
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as necessary
* Consider further management of the patient's GI bleed, such as endoscopy or surgery
* Continue to monitor the patient's WBC count and adjust antibiotics as necessary
* Consider further management of the patient's alcohol withdrawal syndrome, such as benzodiazepines or other medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who was transferred from another hospital for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with an SpO2 of 98%.
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, tachycardic, with a heart rate of 93 bpm.
* Hemodynamics: Blood pressure is 98/66 mmHg, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 2 mmHg.
* Renal function: Creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, with a urine output of 1,580 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Hepatic function: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is 17 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is 23 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALK) is 35 IU/L.
* Coagulation: International normalized ratio (INR) is 1.1, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 27.6 seconds, and platelet count is 140,000/μL.
* Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and month, but has tangential speech and is slightly agitated.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. GI bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding, and the source is suspected to be small bowel, but could also be lower GI. The patient needs to be monitored for further bleeding, and the differential diagnosis needs to be explored.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently anticoagulated due to bleeding. The patient needs to be monitored for further arrhythmias, and the decision to restart anticoagulation needs to be made.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has been in the hospital for several days and has not reported any withdrawal symptoms. The patient needs to be monitored for signs of withdrawal, and treatment needs to be initiated if necessary.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but the patient's hypertension needs to be monitored, and treatment needs to be adjusted if necessary.
5. B12 anemia: The patient has a history of B12 anemia and is receiving supplementation. The patient's hemoglobin level needs to be monitored, and transfusion needs to be considered if necessary.
6. Fevers and leukocytosis: The patient has been noted to have fevers and leukocytosis at the onset of admission. The patient's temperature and white blood cell count need to be monitored, and cultures need to be followed up.
7. Tobacco abuse: The patient is a smoker and needs to be offered nicotine patches to help with withdrawal.
8. FEN: The patient is currently NPO due to ongoing bleeding, but needs to be monitored for nutritional support if the bleeding continues.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient needs to be monitored for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB): At this time appears
   to be secondary to small bowel source as identified on tagged scan at
   [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be lower GI source as colonoscopy
   was obscurred by blood. Differential includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's
   diverticulum, occult malignancy (proximal colon), AVM among other
   possibilities.
   - s/p colonoscopy this AM
   - IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8, has active T+C, 3PIVs
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient has a history of atrial
   fibrillation for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a
   number of years due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not
   currently be anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol,
   holding at present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone given poor likelihood of followup
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - not requiring CIWA
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Can restart as tolerates
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has been transferred from another hospital for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has not been anticoagulated in the past due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. He is currently not anticoagulated due to ongoing bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's heart rate is 119 bpm, and his blood pressure is 96/70 mmHg.
* Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Neurological status: The patient is alert and oriented, with tangential discussion and fluent speech. He is moving all extremities without difficulty.
* Laboratory results: The patient's hemoglobin level is 25.2 g/dL, and his platelet count is 205 K/uL. His liver function tests are slightly elevated, and his kidney function tests are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of further bleeding due to his ongoing GI bleed and his history of atrial fibrillation.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient is at risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his atrial fibrillation and his history of alcohol abuse.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to his prolonged hospitalization and his history of alcohol abuse.
4. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to his inability to eat and his history of alcohol abuse.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of developing hypoglycemia due to his diabetes and his history of alcohol abuse.
6. Hypotension: The patient is at risk of developing hypotension due to his history of atrial fibrillation and his history of alcohol abuse.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his history of atrial fibrillation and his history of alcohol abuse.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrest due to his history of atrial fibrillation and his history of alcohol abuse.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation therapy accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
5. Consider prescribing anticoagulation therapy to the patient once his bleeding has stopped and his coagulation status has improved.
6. Consider prescribing antibiotics to the patient if he develops an infection.
7. Consider prescribing nutritional supplements to the patient if he is at risk of malnutrition.
8. Consider adjusting the patient's insulin therapy if he is at risk of developing hypoglycemia.
9. Consider adjusting the patient's blood pressure therapy if he is at risk of developing hypotension.
10. Consider adjusting the patient's respiratory therapy if he is at risk of developing respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB): At this time appears
   to be secondary to small bowel source as identified on tagged scan at
   [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be lower GI source as colonoscopy
   was obscurred by blood. Differential includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's
   diverticulum, occult malignancy (proximal colon), AVM among other
   possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient has a history of atrial
   fibrillation for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a
   number of years due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not
   currently be anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol,
   holding at present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has been transferred to the ICU for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of GI bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and alcohol abuse, which may be contributing to his current condition. He has been experiencing mild hypotension, tachycardia, and has a history of falls. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte imbalances.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **GI bleeding:** The patient's GI bleed is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding, particularly if the source is not identified and managed promptly.
2. **Atrial fibrillation:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases his risk of developing arrhythmias, particularly if he is not anticoagulated. His current status of holding anticoagulation due to bleeding increases his risk of thromboembolism.
3. **Electrolyte imbalances:** The patient's electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, may contribute to his tachycardia and arrhythmias. Aggressive electrolyte repletion is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. **Infection:** The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly to prevent sepsis.
5. **Nutritional deficiencies:** The patient's history of alcohol abuse and GI bleeding may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency, which needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.
6. **Cardiac complications:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and tachycardia may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
7. **Renal complications:** The patient's history of GI bleeding and electrolyte imbalances may increase his risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. **Pulmonary complications:** The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and tachycardia may increase his risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleeding and manage it accordingly.
2. Anticoagulate the patient with warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin once the bleeding has been controlled.
3. Aggressively manage the patient's electrolyte imbalances with IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation.
4. Investigate and treat the patient's fever and leukocytosis promptly to prevent sepsis.
5. Address the patient's nutritional deficiencies with vitamin B12 supplementation and other necessary nutrients.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and manage any arrhythmias or cardiac complications promptly.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and manage any renal complications promptly.
8. Monitor the patient's pulmonary status closely and manage any pulmonary complications promptly."
