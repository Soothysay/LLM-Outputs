   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement.
   .
   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS placement. Source seen on endoscopy
   at OSH was venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then
   opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were
   non-bleeding.  Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U
   PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with
   activation of massive transfusion protocol; has not had any
   transfusions since.  [**State **] tube removed during the morning.
   - Continue PPI, octreotide gtt
 will touch base with GI regarding
   duration, but likely 48 hr total before transitioning to [**Hospital1 **] PPI and
   discontinuing octreotide
   - Will need repeat US with Doppler to assess TIPS patency
 this should
   be done one week after TIPS (around [**2-16**])
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology, IR, surgery recs
   .
   # Respiratory status: Unclear if patient intubated for EtOH withdraw or
   for EGD.  Patient received paralysis for EGD and for med flight.
   Currently intubated.  Patient has had no problems with oxygenation.
   RSBI [**8-5**] this am.
   - Continue to wean off sedation
   - Continue PSV and attempt to wean off ventilation later today
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Appears to be net volume up on exam and CXR. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload with Cr unlikely where
   he chronically lives. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Trial IV lasix 10mg
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Positive blood cultures. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures. Patient
   does not look septic, other cultures negative. Given medical
   comorbidities, lines and recent hospitalization, will start treatment
   and continue to check cultures.
   - Start vancomycin
   - Check blood cultures both today and tomorrow
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue to use propofol for sedation; wean as tolerated
   - Needs valium prn CIWA once not sedated
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Monitor for signs of encephalopathy s/p weaning off sedation
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   .
   # FEN: IVF bolus, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, no anticoagulation
   # Access: RIJ [**Location (un) 342**], arterial line; will place additional PIV today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement.
   .
   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS placement. Source seen on endoscopy
   at OSH was venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then
   opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were
   non-bleeding.  Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U
   PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with
   activation of massive transfusion protocol; has not had any
   transfusions since.  [**State **] tube removed during the morning.
   - Continue PPI, octreotide gtt
 will touch base with GI regarding
   duration, but likely 48 hr total before transitioning to [**Hospital1 **] PPI and
   discontinuing octreotide
   - Will need repeat US with Doppler to assess TIPS patency
 this should
   be done one week after TIPS (around [**2-16**])
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology, IR, surgery recs
   .
   # Respiratory status: Unclear if patient intubated for EtOH withdraw or
   for EGD.  Patient received paralysis for EGD and for med flight.
   Currently intubated.  Patient has had no problems with oxygenation.
   RSBI [**8-5**] this am.
   - Continue to wean off sedation
   - Continue PSV and attempt to wean off ventilation later today
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Appears to be net volume up on exam and CXR. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload with Cr unlikely where
   he chronically lives. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Trial IV lasix 10mg
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # Positive blood cultures. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures. Patient
   does not look septic, other cultures negative. Given medical
   comorbidities, lines and recent hospitalization, will start treatment
   and continue to check cultures.
   - Start vancomycin
   - Check blood cultures both today and tomorrow
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue to use propofol for sedation; wean as tolerated
   - Needs valium prn CIWA once not sedated
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) secondary to esophageal varices and ethanol abuse. He has undergone emergency endoscopy with banding, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is tachycardic, with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and has a blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg.
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, and the partial pressure of oxygen is 336 mmHg.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 18.6 x 10^9/L, platelet count is 153 x 10^9/L, and liver function tests are elevated, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 45 IU/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 91 IU/L.
* Blood cultures: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, and he has been started on vancomycin.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28 mg/dL.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 4,141 mL of fluids, with a net volume deficit of 41 mL.
* Urine output: The patient's urine output has decreased, and he has been given a bolus of 1 liter of fluid.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Septic shock due to the positive blood cultures
* Hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's cirrhosis and liver dysfunction
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory status and potential for pneumonia
* Renal failure due to the patient's decreased urine output and potential for acute tubular necrosis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's UGIB and potential for further bleeding
* Ethanol withdrawal syndrome due to the patient's recent ethanol abuse
* Infection due to the patient's indwelling lines and catheters

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing PPI and octreotide therapy for GI bleed prophylaxis
* Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and weaning him off sedation and mechanical ventilation as tolerated
* Trial IV lasix for decreased urine output
* Starting vancomycin for the patient's positive blood cultures
* Continuing to monitor the patient's liver function and potential for hepatic encephalopathy
* Following up with hepatology, IR, and surgery recommendations
* Continuing to monitor the patient's fluid balance and potential for further bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU with acute refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after endoscopy and banding at another hospital. He underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement and has been receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, and ceftriaxone. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and has a history of ethanol withdrawal and benzodiazepine use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6, hemoglobin of 29.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 153 K/uL.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications, including:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB and is currently receiving octreotide and pantoprazole to prevent further bleeding.
2. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and has received benzodiazepines to manage withdrawal symptoms.
3. Hepatitis C: The patient has cirrhosis and is likely to have hepatitis C, which may require further treatment.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and may require further respiratory support.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may require further monitoring and treatment for renal failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), which may require further monitoring and treatment.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels are abnormal, and may require further monitoring and treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued management of gastrointestinal bleeding with octreotide and pantoprazole.
2. Monitoring and management of ethanol withdrawal symptoms with benzodiazepines and other medications.
3. Further evaluation and treatment of hepatitis C.
4. Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
5. Renal support with fluids and diuretics.
6. Coagulopathy management with fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions.
7. Electrolyte imbalance management with intravenous fluids and electrolyte supplements.

The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and he will require close monitoring and management in the ICU to address his complex medical condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted to the hospital with variceal bleed and subsequent alcohol withdrawal. He has undergone endoscopy with banding and has had multiple transfusions. He is currently in the ICU due to refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and respiratory failure. He has been extubated and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has a mild icterus in his sclera and ascites. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, as well as an abnormal coagulation profile.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired due to cirrhosis, which can lead to encephalopathy.
2. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures and is at risk for sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been extubated and is receiving oxygen therapy, but is still at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient has had multiple transfusions and is at risk for bleeding due to his coagulopathy.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which can indicate kidney injury.
7. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, which can lead to liver failure.
8. Infection-related complications: The patient has positive blood cultures, which can lead to infection-related complications such as sepsis, abscesses, or meningitis.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Treat the patient's infection with antibiotics.
3. Manage the patient's bleeding with blood transfusions and vasopressors.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any abnormalities.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center.
7. Continue to follow up with the patient's primary care physician and other healthcare providers as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement.
   .
   # Acute refractory UGIB: s/p TIPS. Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was
   venous blood that was attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE
   ulcers also seen on previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.
   Patient has already had banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP
   at OSH, has had 2 units on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive
   transfusion protocol; has not had any transfusions since.  [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].
   - Change PPI to PO bid
   - Discontinue octreotide gtt
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Continue ceftriaxone for GI bleed prophylaxis
   - Continue active type and screen; crossmatch 4 units
   - Continue goal Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology, IR, surgery recs
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Continue to check blood cultures qd [**Date range (1) 12635**]
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix. Still appears to be net
   volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Repeat lasix IV 20mg with repeat during pm prn
   - Continue to monitor UOP
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Start valium prn CIWA
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Stable s/p extubation on [**2-10**] pm.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of ethanol abuse, variceal bleed, and subsequent alcohol withdrawal. The patient has undergone endoscopy with banding and has had multiple blood transfusions.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has been extubated. His SpO2 is 96%, and his ABG shows pH 7.52, PaO2 232, and FiO2 40%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has tachycardia, and his cardiac silhouette is enlarged on CXR, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated, and his mental status is unclear due to the lack of a recent CT head scan.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has had a variceal bleed, and his UOP is decreased. He has been treated with lasix and has had repeat blood cultures.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, and his BUN is 28 mg/dL.
* Hepatic: The patient has cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
* Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus, and his glucose levels are being monitored.
* Infections: The patient has a positive blood culture, but the organism is unknown. He has also had a negative MRSA screen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may require reintubation if his oxygenation or ventilation worsens.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and he may be at risk for cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had a variceal bleed, and he may be at risk for further bleeding.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis, and he may be at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Infections: The patient has a positive blood culture, and he may be at risk for sepsis.
7. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, and he may be at risk for ethanol withdrawal.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider reintubation if necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiovascular status and consider treatment for cardiac failure or arrhythmias if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further treatment if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider treatment for acute kidney injury if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hepatic function and consider treatment for hepatic encephalopathy if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infections and consider treatment for sepsis if necessary.
7. Continue to manage the patient's ethanol withdrawal and consider treatment with benzodiazepines or other medications if necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   decision was made not to place a NG tube
   - Bedside ultrasound did not show a collection of ascites for
   diagnostic paracentesis diagnosis.
   - Patient with bowel movement that appeared dark, but nursing concern
   regarding new bleed. Hct sent at 1600, which was stable at 28.2, 29.1
   at [**2169**].
   - Patient with good response to AM lasix with -1.5L at 1530; 1600
   electrolytes repleted.
   - Lactulose increased to 45ml as patient still with altered mental
   status in afternoon.
   - Patient's RIJ trauma line pulled.
   - Patient with continued altered mental status during late evening, and
   started on Ativan CIWA in the low likelihood this is related with
   withdrawal. He received one milligram during the late evening which
   seems to have calmed him down.
   - Patient with some erythema to red toe that needs to be looked at.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement. TIPS performed. HCT stable. Now with AMS
   concern for benzo withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - PPI PO BID
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Repeat BC today.
   .
   # AMS: Likely related with hepatic encephalopathy, Benzo withdraw, ICU
   delirium.
   - Start lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be
   net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - may need lasix/aldactone in the future
   - Continue to monitor for signs of encephalopathy
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   .
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn, will
   start sip to clears today
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no anticoagulation; PPI
   # Access: RIJ [**Location (un) 342**], PIV 18 gauge x2. Will attempt to remove RIJ this pm.
   # Communication: Patient & sister [**Doctor First Name 2049**]
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; possible to floor
   later this pm although will likely stay in ICU overnight.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement. TIPS performed. HCT stable. Now with AMS
   concern for benzo withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - PPI PO BID
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Repeat BC today.
   .
   # AMS: Likely related with hepatic encephalopathy, Benzo withdraw, ICU
   delirium.
   - Start lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be
   net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - may need lasix/aldactone in the future
   - Continue to monitor for signs of encephalopathy
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for variceal bleed and subsequent TIPS placement. He has been experiencing altered mental status (AMS) and is suspected to have hepatic encephalopathy. He has also had a blood culture positive for gram-positive cocci, which may be a contaminant. The patient's laboratory results show stable hemoglobin levels, but decreased urine output and increasing creatinine levels. He has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin for AMS and is being monitored for signs of encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's AMS may be related to hepatic encephalopathy, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The positive blood culture may indicate a bloodstream infection, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's decreased urine output and increasing creatinine levels may indicate volume overload, which can lead to acute kidney injury.
4. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and high benzo requirement at OSH may indicate a risk of EtOH withdrawal, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient's cirrhosis may be related to hepatitis C, which can lead to liver failure and other complications.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and cirrhosis may indicate nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue lactulose and rifaximin for AMS and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels closely to manage volume overload.
3. Consider antibiotics for the positive blood culture, despite the possibility of contamination.
4. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of EtOH withdrawal and provide supportive care as needed.
5. Consider referral to a transplant center for further evaluation and treatment of cirrhosis.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide supplements as needed to prevent deficiencies."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient, a 50-year-old male with a history of liver disease secondary to EtOH abuse, was admitted to the ICU with variceal bleed and subsequent TIPS placement. He has been managed with lactulose, lasix, and pantoprazole. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, with a stable HCT, and he is tolerating PO lactulose and sips/clears without regurgitation. However, he still has altered mental status, which is likely related to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's urine output is decreased, and his creatinine is downtrending after lasix administration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, which can progress to more severe forms if not managed promptly.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient's variceal bleed is a high-risk condition, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications, especially with the recent TIPS placement.
3. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for Gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a potential infection. However, the patient does not appear septic, and further evaluation is needed to determine the significance of this finding.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's decreased urine output and stable creatinine suggest possible fluid overload, which can lead to further complications if not managed promptly.
5. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms, which can be severe and potentially life-threatening.
6. Hepatitis C/Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis, which can lead to further complications, including liver failure and portal hypertension.
7. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's unclear insulin status and history of diabetes mellitus may lead to further complications, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
8. FEN: The patient's IVF maintenance and bolus administration may lead to electrolyte imbalances and further complications if not monitored closely.
9. Access Complications: The patient's RIJ trauma line and PIV lines may be at risk for complications, including infection and bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve his clinical outcome."

   - Patient tolerated PO lactulose and sip/clears without regurgitation;
   decision was made not to place a NG tube
   - Bedside ultrasound did not show a collection of ascites for
   diagnostic paracentesis diagnosis.
   - Patient with bowel movement that appeared dark, but nursing concern
   regarding new bleed. Hct sent at 1600, which was stable at 28.2, 29.1
   at [**2169**].
   - Patient with good response to AM lasix with -1.5L at 1530; 1600

   - Lactulose increased to 45ml as patient still with altered mental
   status in afternoon.
   - Patient's RIJ trauma line pulled.
   - Patient with continued altered mental status during late evening, and
   started on Ativan CIWA in the low likelihood this is related with
   withdrawal. He received one milligram during the late evening which
   seems to have calmed him down.
   - Patient with some erythema of toe

   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart vancomycin (was discontinued yesterday, first started on [**2-10**]
   and restarted today)
   - Repeat BC today.
   # AMS
   Patient is stuporous today, without focality. Classic for delirium, has
   been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed fluctuating mental
   status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without asterixis and less likely
   due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory status and renal function are
   also good. Given alcohol history, need to check B12. Also initiate
   reversible causes of dementia workup.
   - B12, TSH and consider HIV testing
   - Continue lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to monitor
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix last night. Cr downtrending s/p
   lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely
   AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today.
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Add-on GGT, AFP, direct bilirubin
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement. TIPS performed. HCT stable. Now with AMS
   concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - PPI PO BID (although might this be responsible for elevated liver
   enzymes?)
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart vancomycin (was discontinued yesterday, first started on [**2-10**]
   and restarted today)
   - Repeat BC today.
   # AMS
   Patient is stuporous today, without focality. Classic for delirium, has
   been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed fluctuating mental
   status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without asterixis and less likely
   due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory status and renal function are
   also good. Given alcohol history, need to check B12. Also initiate
   reversible causes of dementia workup.
   - B12, TSH and consider HIV testing
   - Continue lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to monitor
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix last night. Cr downtrending s/p
   lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain
   etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely
   AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today.
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Add-on GGT, AFP, direct bilirubin
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol use disorder (ELSD) who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and was subsequently transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory UGIB.

The patient's condition has been stable, with no signs of bleeding or hypotension. He has been receiving lactulose and rifaximin for management of hepatic encephalopathy, and his mental status has improved with the use of Ativan.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT, AST, and LDH, which may be indicative of liver dysfunction or cholestasis. His bilirubin levels are also elevated, which may be a sign of liver dysfunction or obstruction of the biliary tract.

The patient's blood cultures have been positive for a gram-positive coccus, which may be a contaminant or a sign of infection. He has been started on vancomycin and will continue to receive it for the next 7-10 days.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress or failure. His renal function is also stable, with normal creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

The patient's electrolyte levels are also stable, with no signs of electrolyte imbalance. His glucose levels are slightly elevated, but his hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level is not available.

The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and confusion. He has been receiving Ativan to manage his symptoms, but his mental status has not improved significantly.

The patient's physical examination shows signs of liver disease, including mild icterus and hepatomegaly. His abdominal examination shows mild tenderness and guarding, but no signs of peritonitis or abscess.

Based on the patient's condition, the potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures have been positive for a gram-positive coccus, which may be a sign of infection. He will need to continue to receive vancomycin for the next 7-10 days to manage his infection.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he has been receiving lactulose and rifaximin to manage his symptoms. He will need to continue to receive these medications to manage his hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure if his liver disease worsens or if he develops pneumonia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is stable, but he may be at risk for renal failure if his liver disease worsens or if he develops acute kidney injury.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are stable, but he may be at risk for electrolyte imbalance if he develops a severe infection or if he receives excessive amounts of electrolyte-rich fluids.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and he may be at risk for bleeding again if his liver disease worsens or if he develops a severe infection.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for various medical complications, including infection, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, and bleeding. He will need to continue to receive vancomycin for the next 7-10 days to manage his infection, and he will need to continue to receive lactulose and rifaximin to manage his hepatic encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement. TIPS performed. HCT stable. Now with AMS
   concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - PPI PO BID
   - Needs repeat ultrasound with doppler [**2-16**] to assess TIPS patency
   - Will start sips to clears diet today; NGT ok per hepatology if
   necessary; will continue to monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow hepatology recs
   - Last day Ceftriaxone today.
   .
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Discontinue vancomycin (start date: [**2-10**])
   - Repeat BC today.
   .
   # AMS: Likely related with hepatic encephalopathy, Benzo withdraw, ICU
   delirium.
   - Start lactulose, rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # Decreased UOP: Cr downtrending s/p lasix 40mg IV. Still appears to be
   net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume
   overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Give IV lasix 40mg x1
   - I/O goal
one liter
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   .
   # Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Add-on GGT, AFP, direct bilirubin
   .
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips.
   - Consider ativan (short-term) prn, CIWA scale
   - Continue to monitor for signs of alcohol withdrawal
   - Continue thiamine, folate
   .
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Unclear if hepatitis C has
   been treated in the past.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - may need lasix/aldactone in the future
   - Continue to monitor for signs of encephalopathy
   - continue lactulose/rifaximin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: UGIB (variceal).
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2-11**]
   - Patient tolerated PO lactulose and sip/clears without regurgitation;
   decision was made not to place a NG tube
   - Bedside ultrasound did not show a collection of ascites for
   diagnostic paracentesis diagnosis.
   - Patient with bowel movement that appeared dark, but nursing concern
   regarding new bleed. Hct sent at 1600, which was stable at 28.2, 29.1
   at [**2169**].
   - Patient with good response to AM lasix with -1.5L at 1530; 1600
   electrolytes repleted.
   - Lactulose increased to 45ml as patient still with altered mental
   status in afternoon.
   - Patient's RIJ trauma line pulled.
   - Patient with continued altered mental status during late evening, and
   started on Ativan CIWA in the low likelihood this is related with
   withdrawal. He received one milligram during the late evening which
   seems to have calmed him down.
   - Patient with some erythema to red toe that needs to be looked at.
   [**2-12**]
   - I/O: -1.5 liters at (2200) after 40mg IV lasix
   - Hepatology: Ceftriaxone last day today, Continue as we are.
   - PO Ativan this AM, monitored on CIWA. Agitation, Mental Status seemed
   to improve sp ativan. Spoke with hepatology, plan for [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] if
   continues to be stable.
   - In early evening developed more agitation, redosed ativan, then 5mg
   Haldol IV. Became Hypertensive, Tachycardic, and agitated. Ativan 1 mg

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of liver disease secondary to ethanol abuse, admitted to the hospital with variceal bleed and subsequently transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after undergoing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, with a heart rate of 115 bpm, and hypertension, with a blood pressure of 161/91 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy with a SpO2 of 99%.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and has altered mental status (AMS) likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine withdrawal, and ICU delirium.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient is hemodynamically stable, with a hematocrit (HCT) of 28.2%.
* Laboratory results: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and a positive blood culture with a Gram-positive cocci, likely a contaminant.
* Medical complications: The patient has a high risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the TIPS procedure and the use of vasopressors.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's AMS is likely related to hepatic encephalopathy, which can progress to coma or even death if not managed promptly.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's risk of developing AKI is high due to the TIPS procedure and the use of vasopressors.
3. Infection: The patient's positive blood culture with a Gram-positive cocci, although likely a contaminant, may indicate a risk of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of variceal bleed and the use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver disease and AKI may increase the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome.

Based on the patient's condition and the potential medical complications, the plan of care should include:

1. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status, hemodynamic status, and laboratory results.
2. Management of the patient's AMS with lactulose, rifaximin, and benzodiazepines as needed.
3. Monitoring of the patient's renal function and management of AKI with fluids and vasopressors as needed.
4. Antimicrobial therapy for the patient's positive blood culture, although the culture results are likely a contaminant.
5. Close monitoring of the patient's bleeding risk and management of any bleeding episodes with anticoagulants and blood products as needed.
6. Consideration of liver transplantation for the patient's liver disease, although the patient's active drinking status may make this option less feasible."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, pulmonary edema, gastrointestinal bleed, and respiratory failure. He has a history of liver disease and is on antibiotics for suspected sepsis. Overnight, the patient's condition remained stable, with some fluctuations in his mental status. He had a bowel movement that appeared dark, which raised concerns about a new bleed. His hemodynamics were stable, with a heart rate of 115 bpm and blood pressure of 161/91 mmHg. His oxygen saturation was 99% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.6, hemoglobin of 29.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 181,000/mm3. His liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 184 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 120 IU/L. His blood cultures are pending, with no growth yet.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula, and his airway is at risk for aspiration due to his altered mental status and inability to protect his airway. He is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is on antibiotics for suspected sepsis. If the cultures grow, it could indicate a more severe infection, which could lead to septic shock and organ failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's dark bowel movement raises concerns about a new bleed. If this continues, it could lead to hypovolemic shock and require further intervention.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, and he is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). If his respiratory status deteriorates further, it could lead to respiratory failure and require intubation.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status is concerning, and if it worsens, it could lead to neurological deterioration and require further intervention.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and if his liver function continues to deteriorate, it could lead to liver failure and require further intervention.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are elevated, and if this continues, it could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Obtain B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - Continue to follow AMS as per above
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   - Send A1c
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn; low
   sodium regular diet, soft dysphagia
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, no anticoagulation; PPI
   # Access: PIV 18 gauge x2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Obtain B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted to the hospital with variceal bleeding and subsequent alcohol withdrawal. He has undergone endoscopy with banding and TIPS procedure, and has been transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Mentally status is dense and delirious, with fluctuating levels of consciousness.
* He is oriented only to self and has poor posture, giving the impression of stupor and low tone.
* Respiratory status is good, with a SpO2 of 98%.
* Renal function is stable, with a urine output of 1,560 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Blood pressure is slightly elevated, with a systolic pressure of 154 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance, with a total fluid intake of 2,816 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient has several potential medical complications that require attention:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing more severe encephalopathy.
2. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate liver damage or dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture, which may indicate a systemic infection.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, which may lead to fluid overload and respiratory distress.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding, and is at risk of further bleeding.

The plan for the patient's care is as follows:

* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation as needed.
* Continue to trend liver enzymes and follow GGT, AFP, and direct bilirubin levels.
* Restart vancomycin and continue to monitor for signs of infection.
* Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust fluid intake as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust treatment as needed.
* Consider restarting the patient on thiamine and folate for ethanol withdrawal.
* Continue to follow hepatology recommendations for the patient's liver disease.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - Consider B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to re-assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Obtain pm Hct, and monitor; defer transfusion at this time since
   overall improved picture; Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6,
   platelets > 70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   - Restart vancomycin given great risk if TIPS becomes infected; will
   need trough
   # Positive blood culture x1 set. Coag+ in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes
   Rose at admission, led by LDH and now primarily cholestatic, although
   ALT and AST also elevated. Concern for partial obstruction of biliary
   tract given indolent cholestatic picture, however some parenchymal
   enzymes also. Could be pantoprazole.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes; downtrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   - Obtain ultrasound as per above
   # Decreased UOP
   Resolving with good output to Lasix [**2-12**]. Cr downtrending s/p lasix
   40mg IV. Still appears to be net volume up on exam. Uncertain etiology
   and likely acute, [**3-2**] volume overload. Less likely AIN/ATN/HRS.
   - Follow net fluid balance and give Lasix to ensure negative today with
   goal -1 to -2L
   - Continue to monitor UOP, pm electrolytes
   # EtOH withdrawal: Patient has had high benzo requirement at OSH,
   required intubation with multiple drips. Now out of time period for
   EtOH withdrawal but has been treated with substantial amount of
   benzodiazepine.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody.
   - AFP as above
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - Continue to follow AMS as per above
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   - Send A1c
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn; low
   sodium regular diet, soft dysphagia

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, who was admitted to the hospital with variceal bleeding and underwent endoscopy with banding. He was later transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is stuporous, with dense delirium, and is oriented to self only.
* His mental status is fluctuating, and he is inattentive.
* He has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is being treated with benzodiazepines.
* He has a positive blood culture, which is likely a contaminant, and is being treated with vancomycin.
* He has elevated liver enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), which may be related to a partial obstruction of the biliary tract or pantoprazole.
* He has a decreased urine output, which is resolving with the use of lasix, and is being monitored closely.
* He has a history of ethanol withdrawal and is being treated with benzodiazepines.
* He has a diagnosis of hepatitis C and cirrhosis, and is being followed by hepatology.
* He has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Seizures or status epilepticus due to benzodiazepine withdrawal or elevated liver enzymes
* Infection, particularly in the setting of a positive blood culture and TIPS procedure
* Hepatic encephalopathy, which is already suspected based on the patient's mental status
* Respiratory failure, particularly if the patient's mental status worsens
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or congestive heart failure, due to the patient's underlying cirrhosis
* Renal failure, particularly if the patient's urine output does not improve
* Nutritional deficiencies, particularly if the patient is unable to tolerate oral nutrition
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if the patient's UGIB does not resolve
* Infections, particularly if the patient's immune system is compromised due to cirrhosis or hepatitis C.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his benzodiazepine regimen as needed.
* Continue to treat the patient's infection with vancomycin and monitor his blood cultures.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and adjust his fluid management plan as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust his diet as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
* Consider referring the patient to a liver transplant center for further evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve his clinical outcome."

   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with a variceal bleed and underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate 88 beats per minute, blood pressure 143/91 mmHg, respiratory rate 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is hemodynamically stable with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 90 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,505 mL of intravenous fluids, including 1,640 mL of crystalloid and 865 mL of colloid. The patient has also received 3,435 mL of blood products, including 2,400 mL of packed red blood cells and 1,035 mL of fresh frozen plasma.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving any respiratory support, but has a mild hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 96%.
* Neurological status: The patient is stuporous and has a decreased level of consciousness. He is able to follow simple instructions and has a normal pupillary response.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Cirrhosis with portal hypertension
* Variceal bleed
* Hepatic encephalopathy
* Renal insufficiency
* Hepatitis C
* Hepatitis B
* Ethanol abuse

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including:

* Vancomycin for treatment of a blood culture-positive infection
* Lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy
* Rifaximin for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy
* PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Thiamine and folate for treatment of ethanol abuse
* Aldactone for treatment of ascites

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete blood count (CBC): The patient has a white blood cell count of 9.9 x 10^9/L, a platelet count of 166 x 10^9/L, and a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL.
* Liver function tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), with a liver enzymes-to-prothrombin time (INR) ratio of 1.8.
* Renal function tests (RFTs): The patient has a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24 mg/dL.
* Electrolyte levels: The patient has a sodium level of 141 mmol/L, a potassium level of 3.5 mmol/L, and a chloride level of 107 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies are as follows:

* Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
* Endoscopy: The patient has evidence of variceal bleeding and esophageal ulcers.
* Ultrasound: The patient has evidence of gallbladder wall edema and distension.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, the potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is impaired, which could lead to further deterioration in his mental status.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which could indicate kidney damage.
* Ascites: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which could lead to further fluid accumulation in his abdomen.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has evidence of variceal bleeding and esophageal ulcers, which could lead to further bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a blood culture-positive infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Hepatitis C: The patient has evidence of hepatitis C infection, which could lead to further liver damage.
* Hepatitis B: The patient has evidence of hepatitis B infection, which could lead to further liver damage.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - FU B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to re-assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Daily HCt, Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets >
   70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   # Positive blood culture x1 set.
   Enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures. Will
   continue per hepatology recommendations.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes: Expected sp TIPS.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes: AST/ALT downtrending  while  AP,
   T.bili; uptrending
   - Follow GGT (180), AFP (2.8), direct bilirubin (5.1)
   # EtOH abuse: As above.
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - PO Thiamine, Folate
   # Hep C/cirrhosis: Likely secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C.
   Unclear if patient listed on transplant list, although unlikely as
   patient appears to be actively drinking. Is HCV positive and borderline
   for HBV shell antibody. AFP normal.
   - Continue to follow hepatology recs as above
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need Aldactone in the future
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - Continue to follow AMS as per above
   # DM: Unclear if on insulin at home per notes.
   - Continue SSI
   - FU  A1c
   # FEN: IVF maintenance + bolus prn, replete electrolytes prn; low

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo M ELSD secondary to EtOH abuse admitted to OSH with variceal
   bleed s/p EGD with banding x2 and subsequent alcohol withdrawal
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for management of recurrent refractory UGIB s/p
   [**State **] tube placement and subsequent removal. TIPS performed
   although with modest drop in gradient s/p procedure. HCT stable. Now
   with AMS concern for benzo. withdraw and hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   # AMS
   Patient continues to be stuporous today, without focality. Classic for
   delirium, has been picking at sheets, inattentive and showed
   fluctuating mental status. Thus, is encephalopathic but without
   asterixis and less likely due to hepatic dysfunction. Respiratory
   status and renal function are also good. Given alcohol history, need to
   check B12 as possible Korsakoff. Also initiate reversible causes of
   dementia workup.
   - FU B12, TSH
   - Consider HIV testing
   - Continue Lactulose, Rifixamin
   - PO Ativan, CIWA scale
   - Avoid Haldol
   - Continue to re-assess
   # UGIB: s/p TIPS: HCT stable. Hemodynamically stable.  Recap of
   events:  (Source seen on endoscopy at OSH was venous blood that was
   attempted to be sclerosed but then opened up.  GE ulcers also seen on
   previous banding sites that were non-bleeding.  Patient has already had
   banding x 2 at OSH.  Pt s/p 7U PRBC and 4 FPP at OSH, has had 2 units
   on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] with activation of massive transfusion protocol;
   has not had any transfusions since.  TIPS performed [**2-9**]. [**State **]
   tube removed [**2-10**].)
   - Continue PPI PO bid
   - Obtain ultrasound with Doppler by [**2-16**] (will likely do on Monday) to
   assess TIPS patency
   - Continue diet; NGT ok per hepatology if necessary; will continue to
   monitor
   - Continue active type and screen
   - Daily HCt, Keep in mind prior goals Hct > 30, INR < 1.6, platelets >
   70, fibrinogen > 100
   - Appreciate and will continue to follow Hepatology recs
   - Finished Ceftriaxone [**2-13**]
   # Positive blood culture x1 set.
   Enterococcus sensitive to Vancomycin in one set of blood cultures.
   Patient does not look septic, other cultures negative. Suspect is a
   contaminant, but given medical comorbidities, lines and recent
   hospitalization, started treatment and continue to check cultures. Will
   continue per hepatology recommendations.
   - Restart and continue Vancomycin (was discontinued [**2-12**], first started
   on [**2-10**] and restarted [**2-13**])
   - Repeat blood culture qd for 3 days (1/16
 [**2-15**])
   - Obtain CXR, UA
   # Elevated Liver Enzymes: Expected sp TIPS.
   - Continue to trend liver enzymes: AST/ALT downtrending  while  AP,

Summary:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse admitted to the hospital with variceal bleed, s/p EGD with banding, and subsequent alcohol withdrawal. He was transferred to the ICU for management of recurrent refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after TIPS procedure. The patient is currently stuporous, with fluctuating mental status, and has AMS concerns. He has a history of EtOH abuse, and his liver enzymes are elevated. The patient is also positive for Hepatitis C and has cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE): The patient's stuporous state and fluctuating mental status may be indicative of HE, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and liver failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for Enterococcus, which may indicate a possible septicemia. However, the patient does not appear septic, and other cultures are negative.
3. Infection: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and he has a history of EtOH abuse, which may increase his risk of developing infections.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of variceal bleed and UGIB, and may be at risk for further bleeding complications.
5. Kidney Injury: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, which may increase his risk of developing kidney injury or acute kidney injury.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, which may increase his risk of developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's soft dysphagia diet and low sodium regular diet may increase his risk of malnutrition, which can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his medication as needed to manage his AMS.
2. Continue to trend the patient's liver enzymes and follow up with hepatology recommendations.
3. Restart and continue Vancomycin treatment for the patient's positive blood culture.
4. Repeat blood cultures qd for 3 days to monitor for any changes in the patient's infection status.
5. Obtain a CXR and UA to rule out any potential respiratory or kidney complications.
6. Continue to follow up with the patient's EtOH abuse treatment and counseling.
7. Consider listing the patient for liver transplantation, as he is HCV positive and has cirrhosis.

ICU Care:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust his medication as needed to manage his underlying medical conditions.
2. Continue to provide nutrition support with a soft dysphagia diet and low sodium regular diet.
3. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's lines and access sites for any signs of infection or complications.
5. Continue to follow up with the patient's code status and disposition."
