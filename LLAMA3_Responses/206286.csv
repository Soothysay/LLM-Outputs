   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo woman with ESRD on HD with recent line sepsis presenting with
   fever.
   # EKG changes: CP on presentation thought to be [**12-26**] hyperkalemia with
   rate and metabolic related changes resolved w/ sedation and BP control
   with nitro paste. Now CP free x 36 hours but with persistently abnormal
   ST-T changes on EKGs despite HD. Likely demand-related changes in
   setting of fluid shifts post-HD. Less likely ACS as pt asymptomatic and
   downtrending CKs with stable trops.
   - Appreciate Cards c/s; will f/u recs and check TTE today for new WMA.
   - Cont ASA, beta blocker
   - Holding heparin gtt for now in setting of bleed
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - CK has peaked. Trops stabilizing in high 0.60
s likely [**12-26**] renal
   failure. No need to cycle enzymes now.
   - F/U am EKG
   - check cholesterol and start statin
   # Dropping Hct: Likely [**12-26**] continued oozing from femoral line insertion
   site in setting of heparin gtt, now discontinued.
   - Compression applied to fem line
   - IR made aware. F/U recs.
   - Maintain active T&S with adequate peripheral access
   - Check post-transfusion hct; transfuse for Hct <30
   # Sepsis/fever: Hypotension resolved; no leukocytosis. On vanc/zosyn
   for empiric tx of infection with most likely source her dialysis
   catheter given her history although cx neg to date; cath pulled and
   temp HD line placed. Concern for osteomyelitis given initial complaint
   of back pain but without tenderness to palpation on exam. Endocarditis
   also possible. DFA neg for influenza. Ucx neg.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - influenza DFA
   - Continue vancomycin;
   - d/c zosyn as cx NGTD x 48 h
   - Evaluate for evidence of endocarditis on TTE being done for WMA
   - Consider MRI spine if above w/u negative
   # Back pain: Osteomyelitis is possibility but pt currently w/o spine
   tenderness.
   - Follow exam; morphine prn
   - Consider MRI if not improving
   # ESRD: MWF dialysis.  HD cath pulled and temp lined placed; dialyzed
   yesterday.
   - F/u renal recs for HD and plan for new HD line (AV fistula
   thrombosed)
   # Diabetes: Cont lantus + ISS
   # Hypertension: BP nomotensive
   - Restarted on low-dose beta blocker; uptitrate as tolerated
   - Holding ACE for now but would restart as tolerated as pt has resumed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted to the ICU due to fever and line sepsis. She was treated with kayexalate, calcium, D50, and insulin for hyperkalemia, and stress dose steroids were decreased to hydrocortisone 50 q8h. A femoral HD line was placed, and the patient underwent HD. The patient's EKG showed old RBBB, TWI in II/III/aVF, V4-V6 with 1mm STE in aVR and V1, which was thought to be demand-related changes in the setting of fluid shifts after HD. The patient was given ativan 1mg po for anxiety/insomnia and was started on heparin gtt for anticoagulation. The patient's Hct dropped from 31.3% to 25.3% and was transfused with 2 units of blood. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated CK and troponin-T levels, which were thought to be due to renal failure. The patient's sepsis/fever was treated with vancomycin and zosyn, and her back pain was evaluated for osteomyelitis and endocarditis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding from the femoral HD line site, which continued despite dressing and heparin gtt discontinuation.
2. Hypotension, which was resolved with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
3. Hyperkalemia, which was treated with kayexalate, calcium, D50, and insulin.
4. Renal failure, which was evidenced by elevated CK and troponin-T levels.
5. Sepsis/fever, which was treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
6. Osteomyelitis or endocarditis, which was evaluated with cultures and imaging studies.
7. Hypertension, which was treated with a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
8. Hypocalcemia, which was treated with calcium supplementation.
9. Hypomagnesemia, which was treated with magnesium supplementation.
10. Hypophosphatemia, which was treated with phosphorus supplementation.

The patient's condition is stable, and she is being monitored closely for any signs of worsening bleeding, hypotension, or sepsis. She is also being evaluated for evidence of osteomyelitis or endocarditis, and her laboratory results are being monitored for any signs of renal failure or other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo woman with ESRD on HD with recent line sepsis presenting with
   fever and back pain.
   # EKG changes: CP on presentation thought to be [**12-26**] hyperkalemia with
   rate and metabolic related changes resolved w/ sedation and BP control
   with nitro paste. Now CP free x 36 hours but with persistently abnormal
   ST-T changes on EKGs despite HD. Likely demand-related changes in
   setting of fluid shifts post-HD. Less likely ACS as pt asymptomatic and
   downtrending cardiac enzymes.
   - Appreciate Cards c/s; will f/u recs
   - Cont ASA, beta blocker
   - Holding heparin gtt for now in setting of bleed
   - Transfuse for Hct <30
   - Cont to cycle enzymes
   - F/u AM EKG

   site in setting of heparin gtt, now discontinued.
   - Compression applied to fem line
   - IR made aware
   - Maintain active T&S with adequate peripheral access
   - Monitor q8h Hct; transfuse for Hct <30
   # Sepsis/fever: Hypotension resolved; no leukocytosis. On vanc/zosyn
   for empiric tx of infection with most likely source her dialysis
   catheter given her history although cx neg to date; cath pulled and
   temp HD line placed. Concern for osteomyelitis given initial complaint
   of back pain but without tenderness to palpation on exam. Endocarditis
   also possible. DFA neg for influenza. Ucx neg.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - influenza DFA
   - Continue vancomycin; consider d/c zosyn as cx NGTD x 48 h
   - Evaluate for evidence of endocarditis on TTE
   - Consider MRI spine if above w/u negative
   # Back pain: Osteomyelitis is possibility but pt currently w/o spine
   tenderness.
   - Follow exam; morphine prn
   - Consider MRI if not improving
   # ESRD: MWF dialysis.  HD cath pulled and temp lined placed; dialyzed
   yesterday.
   - Monitor lytes q8h in setting of EKG changes
   - F/u renal recs for HD and plan for new HD line (AV fistula
   thrombosed)
   # Diabetes: Cont lantus + ISS
   # Hypertension: BP nomotense
   - Restarted on low-dose beta blocker; uptitrate as tolerated
   - Holding ACE for now but would restart as tolerated as pt has resumed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with fever and back pain. The patient's recent line sepsis has been treated, and she has been on HD with recent changes to her medication regimen.

The patient's EKG changes are notable, with persistently abnormal ST-T changes despite HD. The cardiologist believes that these changes are likely demand-related and related to fluid shifts after HD, rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's cardiac enzymes are downtrending, and she remains asymptomatic.

The patient is also experiencing bleeding from the femoral line insertion site, which has continued despite dressing changes. The heparin gtt has been discontinued, and compression has been applied to the site. The patient's Hct is 25.3%, and she is being transfused for Hct <30.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is on anticoagulation therapy, which has been held in setting of active bleed. She is also being treated for sepsis/fever with vancomycin and Zosyn, and cultures are pending. The patient's back pain is concerning for osteomyelitis or endocarditis, and a TTE is being ordered to evaluate for evidence of endocarditis. An MRI spine may be considered if the above w/u is negative.

The patient's other medical conditions include diabetes, hypertension, and ESRD, for which she is on various medications. Her nutritional status is diabetic and renal, and she is being monitored for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding from the femoral line insertion site may lead to further complications, such as hematoma or organ damage.
2. Infection: The patient's history of line sepsis and ongoing bleeding may increase her risk of developing further infections.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's history of back pain and recent line sepsis may indicate a higher risk of developing endocarditis.
4. Osteomyelitis: The patient's back pain and recent line sepsis may also indicate a higher risk of developing osteomyelitis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's persistently abnormal EKG changes and downtrending cardiac enzymes may indicate a higher risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and ongoing HD may lead to further complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's ongoing bleeding and sepsis may lead to further hemodynamic instability, which may require additional interventions.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."
