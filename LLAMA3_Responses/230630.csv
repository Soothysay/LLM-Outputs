   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion.
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn
   - US-guided thoracentesis today
   - Consider high-res CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia: Perhaps related to acute renal failure.
   - Phosphate today is normal.
   .
   # Htn: Hold home lisinopril, amlodipine and hctz while pt on pressors.
   .
   # H/o CVA: Residual L deficits.
   - Continue statin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* HR: 82 bpm (72-86)
* BP: 139/76 mmHg (91-143/76-91)
* RR: 23 inspirations per minute (11-34)
* SpO2: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Right rhonchi and left minimal breath sounds on lung examination
* Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops on cardiovascular examination
* Soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen with present bowel sounds
* No foley catheter in place
* Warm, well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses
* Neurological examination shows A+Ox2 (to [**Hospital1 19**], [**Holiday **], name, not oriented to year) with slow speech and intact CN II-XII

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 16.7
* Hct: 35.9
* Plt: 399
* Cr: 1.4
* Glucose: 118
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.1/29.7/1.5, ALT/AST: 6/31, Alk Phos/T Bili: 99/0.8, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, LDH: 339 IU/L, Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are:

1. Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, tachycardia, and lab results suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21, indicating septic shock. The patient is at risk for further deterioration and requires close monitoring.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has a history of pneumonia and pleural effusion, which may contribute to respiratory distress. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, and ABG monitoring is recommended.
3. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 21, which suggests lactic acidosis and uremia. The patient requires continued IVF for elevated lactate and ABG monitoring.
4. Massive left pleural effusion: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion, which may be secondary to infection or malignant disease. The patient requires US-guided thoracentesis and consideration of high-res CT.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has lab results suggestive of acute renal failure, which may be due to hypotension, ATN, or prerenal renal failure. The patient requires careful monitoring of urine output and electrolytes.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has elevated phosphate levels, which may be related to acute renal failure. The patient requires monitoring of phosphate levels and consideration of phosphate binders.
7. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which requires close monitoring and consideration of antihypertensive medications.
8. History of CVA: The patient has residual L deficits from a previous CVA, which may impact her neurological examination and require adjustments to her care plan.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue norepinephrine with a goal MAP > 60
* Bolus with IVF as needed to try to wean norepinephrine
* Broadly culture blood, urine, and sputum
* Place an arterial line to monitor blood pressure
* Check mixed venous saturation, and consider transfusion if Hct < 30
* Continue IVF for elevated lactate
* ABG monitoring
* A line for ABG monitoring
* Continue vanc and zosyn for pneumonia
* US-guided thoracentesis
* Consider high-res CT
* Hold ACE and diuretic for acute renal failure
* Renally dose medications
* Monitor urine lytes and electrolytes
* Continue statin for history of CVA
* IVF, replete electrolytes, S+S for FEN
* Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin
* Access with peripherals and CVL
* Communication with patient and healthcare team
* Code status: Full code

   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.

   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, an 88-year-old woman, is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has undergone thoracentesis, with 1400ml of serosanguinous fluid removed. The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status following the procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77bpm, blood pressure of 135/72mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2L nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and anion gap, indicating sepsis and metabolic acidosis.

The patient has been treated with norepinephrine for hypotension, and her blood pressure is being monitored closely. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, for suspected pneumonia and UTI/urosepsis. The patient's pleural effusion is being monitored, and she is scheduled for further thoracentesis and possibly high-resolution CT imaging.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension, and is being managed with fluid restriction and diuretic hold. Her electrolyte levels are being monitored, and she is receiving phosphate repletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia-related complications, such as respiratory failure, pleural effusion, or empyema.
3. Pleural effusion-related complications, such as re-expansion pulmonary edema or recurrent effusion.
4. Acute renal failure-related complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, or uremia.
5. Metabolic acidosis-related complications, such as lactic acidosis or uremic acidosis.
6. Cardiovascular complications, such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.

Given the patient's complex condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response to prevent and manage potential complications."

   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion
   with exudative
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30

   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with Unasyn x 10 day course for aspiration PNA (could
   transition to Augmentin)
   - Continue O2 PRN
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue Unasyn as above
   - Hold off on draining fluid re-accumulation at this time as pt
   minimally symptomatic; may require repeat tap if sx accelerate (with
   Pleurex catheter placement)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has been treated with antibiotics and has undergone thoracentesis, with 1400ml of serosanguinous fluid removed. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, and acute renal failure. Her lab results show elevated lactate levels, an anion gap of 21, and a pH of 7.45 in the pleural fluid. She has also been experiencing hypertension, which is being managed with pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to progress if not adequately managed, leading to septic shock, organ failure, and mortality.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, if her oxygenation and ventilation requirements continue to deteriorate.
3. Anion-Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis is likely to worsen if not managed, leading to further metabolic acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to progress if not managed, leading to further kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's hyperphosphatemia is likely to worsen if not managed, leading to further kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely to worsen if not managed, leading to further cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, stroke, and mortality.
7. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusion is likely to re-accumulate if not managed, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Malignancy: The patient's history of breast cancer and mediastinal lymph node involvement on PET scan suggests a high risk of malignant pleural effusion, which may require further management and monitoring.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further respiratory support if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's anion-gap acidosis with IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider further management if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels, including phosphate, and consider further management if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and consider further management if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's pleural effusion closely and consider further management if necessary.
8. Consider further imaging studies, such as a high-resolution CT scan, to evaluate the patient's pleural effusion and potential malignant involvement.
9. Consider further laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, to monitor the patient's response to treatment and identify potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a pleural effusion, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered nutrition. The patient underwent thoracentesis, which removed 1400ml of serosanguinous fluid, resulting in improvement in respiratory status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 135/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 16.7-13.1 K/uL
* Hct: 35.9-36.6%
* Plt: 399-387 K/uL
* Cr: 1.4-1.0 mg/dL
* Glucose: 118-83 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.6/28.2/1.4, ALT/AST: 6/31, Alk Phos/T Bili: 99/0.8, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, LDH: 339 IU/L, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total input of 670 mL and output of 2370 mL, resulting in a deficit of 1700 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to the patient's pleural effusion and sepsis
* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or cardiovascular instability
* Nutritional deficiencies due to altered nutrition and inadequate caloric intake
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and presence of central lines
* Stress ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding due to sepsis and corticosteroid use
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Lactic acidosis or metabolic acidosis due to inadequate glucose control or sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance, while also addressing the potential complications mentioned above."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion.
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including acute kidney injury, hyperphosphatemia, anion-gap acidosis, and hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and anion gap, suggesting sepsis. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Her renal function is impaired, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 35.9 mL/min.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 95% and a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula.

The patient's cardiovascular status is unstable, with a systolic blood pressure of 135 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 72 mmHg. She is receiving norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg.

The patient's neurological status is stable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Pneumonia-related complications, such as respiratory failure and pleural effusion.
3. Acute kidney injury-related complications, such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
4. Anion-gap acidosis-related complications, such as lactic acidosis and uremia.
5. Hypertension-related complications, such as cardiovascular instability and organ damage.
6. Hyperphosphatemia-related complications, such as hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and nephrocalcinosis.
7. Respiratory failure-related complications, such as hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg.
3. Fluid management to prevent hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Nutritional support to promote recovery and prevent malnutrition.
5. Glycemic control to prevent hyperglycemia and its complications.
6. Electrolyte management to prevent electrolyte imbalances and their complications.
7. Renal replacement therapy to treat acute kidney injury and prevent further kidney damage.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and severe sepsis. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications and promote recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion
   with exudative
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn
   - US-guided thoracentesis today
   - Consider high-res CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia: Perhaps related to acute renal failure.
   - Phosphate today is normal.
   .
   # Htn: Hold home lisinopril, amlodipine and hctz while pt on pressors.
   .
   # H/o CVA: Residual L deficits.
   - Continue statin.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia, with a large left-sided pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels suggest septic shock. Prolonged sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's pleural effusion and pneumonia can cause respiratory compromise, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure.
3. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap of 21 and delta-delta of 10-11 suggest metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to acid-base imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's hypotension, oliguria, and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's elevated phosphate levels can exacerbate acute renal failure, and prolonged hyperphosphatemia can lead to calcification of soft tissues and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can exacerbate cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and stroke.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and residual L deficits suggest a high risk of neurological deterioration, including seizures, stroke, and cognitive decline.
8. Infections: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion increase the risk of secondary infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.

To mitigate these complications, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management of her sepsis, respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, acute renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, hypertension, and neurological status."
