   24 Hour Events:
   Hcts 21->27.9 after 2 units. Received 1 more unit and hct 27.6 but
   checked while going in so will need repeat this am.
   Sgy is following as concern for developing toxic megacolon as well as
   may need colectomy depending on results of the scope. Suggested
   starting Cipro.
 CHEST PAIN - At [**2142-9-29**] 02:20 AM
   Drank 50% of golytely. Then, pt OOB to commode. Stated feeling
   nauseous. Had syncopal event without LOC. Was helped to knees by RN.
   did not hit head. Was able to be helped back into bed. Complained of
   CP. EKG done.
    -> no change from prior. Enzymes sent. 2units pRBCs and 500 mL NS
   infused with return of SBPs to120s and resolution of CP. Called GI to
   ask if should continue golytely. Can put down NGT if can
t tolerate PO
   but after 4mg zofran could tolerate PO golytely and had no further
   episodes of syncope or CP.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, is being treated for a lower GI bleed in the setting of an active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. He presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel movements and has been transfused a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Despite this, he remains hemodynamically stable after a syncopal episode.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg. His respiratory support is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 100% and an ABG of //25/.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a slightly tender abdomen with bowel sounds, and his neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, a hematocrit of 27.6%, and a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate acid level of 1.1 mmol/L.

The patient is being treated with pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and he is also receiving zofran for nausea. He is being monitored for toxic megacolon and may require a colectomy depending on the results of the upcoming colonoscopy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Toxic megacolon: This is a life-threatening complication of UC that can lead to colonic dilatation and perforation.
2. Colonic perforation: This can occur if the patient's colonic inflammation worsens and the colon becomes perforated, leading to peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate may fluctuate due to his underlying UC and GI bleed.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly C. difficile, given his prolonged use of antibiotics and steroids.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels may continue to fluctuate due to his steroid use and potential GI bleed.
6. DVT: The patient is at increased risk for developing DVT due to his inflammatory state and prolonged steroid use.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient may be at risk for developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, due to his underlying UC and prolonged use of antibiotics.

Based on this information, I recommend continued close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. Additionally, the patient should be treated with antibiotics and steroids as directed, and his colonoscopy should be performed as scheduled to assess for toxic megacolon and potential complications."

 CHEST PAIN - At [**2142-9-29**] 02:20 AM
   Drank 50% of golytely. Then, pt OOB to commode. Stated feeling
   nauseous. Had syncopal event without LOC. Was helped to knees by RN.
   did not hit head. Was able to be helped back into bed. Complained of
   CP. EKG done.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 37-year-old male with active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare, presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, characterized by bloody bowel movements. He has been transfused a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable. Despite this, he experienced a syncopal episode, which resolved with treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL, a hematocrit of 27.6%, and a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 136 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and calcium level of 7.4 mg/dL.

The patient's medical plan includes the following:

1. Lower GI bleed: The patient will continue to receive transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level of 30, and a colonoscopy will be performed once he finishes the golytely preparation.
2. UC flare: The patient will continue to receive treatment for his UC flare, including IV steroids, Flagyl, and Asacol.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient will have C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, and stool O&P tests to rule out GI infections.
4. Swollen right knee: The patient will have a follow-up examination to assess the severity of his swollen right knee, which may be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC or potentially a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Toxic megacolon: The patient's UC flare may lead to toxic megacolon, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Colectomy: The patient's persistent GI bleed and falling hemoglobin level may necessitate a colectomy to manage his symptoms.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and potential GI infections may increase his risk of developing sepsis or other infections.
4. DVT: The patient's swollen right knee and inflammatory state may increase his risk of developing a DVT, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his GI bleed, UC flare, and potential complications to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour old ICU admission with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has increased from 21 to 27.9% after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and another unit of pRBCs is planned for the morning. The patient is at risk of developing toxic megacolon and may require a colectomy. The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have worsened, with the patient experiencing nausea, vomiting, and syncope. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no change from prior, and enzymes were sent. The patient received 2 units of pRBCs and 500 mL of normal saline (NS) with a return of systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 120s and resolution of chest pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's risk of developing toxic megacolon is high, which can lead to sepsis, shock, and death if not managed promptly.
2. Colectomy: The patient may require a colectomy if the scope results indicate the need for surgical intervention, which carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and prolonged recovery.
3. Sepsis: The patient's GI symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++), are abnormal, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is abnormal, with a total intake of 1,300 mL and an output of 50 mL, which can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the risk of respiratory failure is high, especially if the patient develops sepsis or toxic megacolon.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or infarction, is high due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and electrolyte imbalance."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused atotal of 4 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable, but still having bloody BMs and is
   orthostatic.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 23
   - continue treatment of ulcerative colitis as below
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - Colonoscopy tomorrow given continued GI bleed and falling HCT.
   Go-lytely prep started on floor, zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following.
   .
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   - continue Asacol and enemas for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - NPO for now  except meds
   .
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   .
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted with a lower GI bleed in the setting of an active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. He has been transfused with 4 units of PRBCs and remains hemodynamically stable, but still has bloody bowel movements and is orthostatic. He has undergone a CT abdomen/pelvis that showed colitis. The patient's hemoglobin has increased from 21 to 27.6% after transfusions, but his hematocrit is still low. He has been started on pantoprazole and may require a colectomy depending on the results of a colonoscopy scheduled for tomorrow.

The patient experienced a syncopal event without loss of consciousness, followed by chest pain. His electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no changes, and his enzymes were sent. He was given 2 units of PRBCs and 500 mL of normal saline, which resolved his chest pain and restored his blood pressure to 120s.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 15.0, likely secondary to steroids. He is being treated empirically for C. difficile infection and will undergo further testing to rule out other infections.

The patient has a swollen right knee, which is believed to be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC. He is at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his inflammatory state, and a negative LEI (Lupus erythematosus, Eosinophilia, and Increased Immune complexes) test was obtained.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Toxic megacolon: The patient's UC flare and colitis may lead to toxic megacolon, which can be life-threatening.
2. Colectomy: The patient may require a colectomy if the colonoscopy tomorrow shows severe colitis or toxic megacolon.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's inflammatory state and immobility make him at increased risk for DVT.
4. Infections: The patient's leukocytosis and C. difficile infection may lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's syncopal event and chest pain may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential for prolonged hospitalization may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare who presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He underwent an emergency colonoscopy, which revealed a single lesion in the transverse colon consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) rather than UC.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamically stable with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.3 g/dL and a hematocrit (Hct) of 32.9%.
* He has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is still bleeding.
* His coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5, which responded to IV vitamin K.
* He is receiving IV steroids and flagyl for his UC flare.
* He has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.0, which may be secondary to steroids.
* He has hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 248 mg/dL, which is likely related to steroids.
* He has a swollen right knee, which may be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC or a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding and low Hb level put him at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal INR and coagulation profile put him at risk for bleeding and clotting complications.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and receipt of antibiotics increase his risk for infection, particularly Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.
4. Steroid-induced complications: The patient's receipt of steroids may lead to complications such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and mood changes.
5. DVT: The patient's swollen right knee and inflammatory state put him at risk for DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
6. Toxic megacolon: The patient's UC flare and receipt of steroids put him at risk for toxic megacolon, a life-threatening complication of inflammatory bowel disease.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's chest pain and receipt of blood products put him at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of lower GI bleed in the setting of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. The patient presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel movements and has been transfused with a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level has continued to fall despite transfusions, and he is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a single lesion in the transverse colon, consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) rather than UC. The patient's coagulation status is compromised, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5, which has responded to IV vitamin K.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 24.1 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 32.9%
* White blood cell count: 15.0 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 324 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* LDH: 136 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.2 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of UC, and he is currently receiving IV steroids and metronidazole for his UC flare. The patient's underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change his management at present.

The patient's current medications include:

* Pantoprazole (Protonix) IV BID
* Zofran for nausea
* IV Flagyl for C. difficile coverage

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Serial Hct checks every 6 hours, with transfusion to a Hct of 30%
* Two peripheral IVs
* PPI IV BID
* Zofran for nausea
* Surgery following and serial exams for toxic megacolon
* Continue IV steroids for UC flare
* Continue Flagyl until C. difficile is negative for 3 consecutive stool samples
* Appreciate GI recs
* Clear liquids

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding and low Hb level may lead to further complications, such as anemia, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.5 indicates a risk of bleeding or hemorrhage, which may be exacerbated by the patient's ongoing bleeding and low platelet count.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent transfusions increase his risk of infection, particularly with C. difficile.
4. DVT: The patient's swollen right knee and increased risk of DVT due to his inflammatory state may lead to deep vein thrombosis.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's chest pain and recent blood loss may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac tamponade.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential cardiac complications may lead to respiratory distress or failure.
7. GI complications: The patient's ongoing UC flare and potential CD may lead to further GI complications, such as toxic megacolon or perforation.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential GI complications may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
9. Hyperglycemia: The patient's recent steroid use may lead to hyperglycemia, which may be exacerbated by his underlying disease and medication regimen.
10. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which may require further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a lower GI bleed in the setting of an active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. He underwent an emergent colonoscopy, which revealed a single lesion in the transverse colon consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) rather than UC. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable. His hemoglobin (Hct) has continued to fall despite transfusions, and he is currently on vitamin K therapy. He has a history of UC flare, which began 6 weeks prior to admission, and is currently being treated with IV steroids and Flagyl. He also has leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to steroids, and is being evaluated for possible gastrointestinal infections.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Toxic Megacolon: Given the patient's history of UC flare and the presence of a single lesion in the transverse colon, there is a risk of toxic megacolon, which can lead to perforation and sepsis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.5 and history of coagulopathic bleeding suggest a risk of bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and history of UC flare make him susceptible to infections, particularly gastrointestinal infections such as Clostridioides difficile (C. diff).
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's inflammatory state and history of UC increase his risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of taking steroids and his current treatment with IV steroids increase his risk of hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of blood loss and possible cardiac symptoms such as chest pain increase his risk of cardiac complications, particularly myocardial infarction.

ICU Care:

The patient requires close monitoring in the ICU to manage his hemodynamic instability, bleeding risk, and potential complications. He should be closely monitored for signs of toxic megacolon, infection, and bleeding complications. His IV steroids and Flagyl should be continued as directed, and he should be evaluated for possible gastrointestinal infections. His glycemic control should be closely monitored, and he should be evaluated for possible cardiac complications."
