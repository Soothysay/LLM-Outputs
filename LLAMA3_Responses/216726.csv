You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has undergone multi-lumen insertion and has had blood and urine cultures taken. The patient has a history of skin reactions to cefepime and a rash. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's neurological examination is incomplete due to the patient's inability to respond or move. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, but the patient's chest pain and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and SpO2 of 100% suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin-T levels suggest the possibility of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's skin reaction to cefepime and rash suggest the possibility of infection.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's incomplete neurological examination and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of neurological complications, such as encephalopathy or seizures.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and chest pain suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Chest pain/hypotension: Patient with cancer, s/p radiation and
   chemotherapy with subtle diffuse EKG changes and new small pericardial
   effusion that is not impairing the homodynamic, but may be causing
   chest pain. This would be compatible with the picture of pericarditis.
   However, treatment cannot be given in the setting of low platelets. In
   the other hand, patient presented with sudden pain and with
   bradycardia, which may suggest esophageal spasm with posterior
   vaso-vagal in the setting of low intravascular volume, mostly in a
   patient with history of bad reflux and GI ulcers. Another possibility
   is anxiety or TRAP.
   -          Follow homodynamic parameters
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] be able to go to floor if stable in PM
   -          Measure CVP; goal [**4-26**].
   -          Fluids if hypotensive
   -          Continue antibiotics for now (cefepime for neutropenia in
   setting of possible infection)
   -          Continue levofloxacin for UTI
   # Thomrobycotpenia: transfuse with a goal of >10,000
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -discuss w/ BMT team in a.m. further management for the patient's
   lymphoma
   .
   # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10.
   .
   # FEN:  regular diet, PPI as above
   .
   # Access  Central line, IJ

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # Chest pain/hypotension: Patient with cancer, s/p radiation and
   chemotherapy with subtle diffuse EKG changes and new small pericardial
   effusion that is not impairing the homodynamic, but may be causing
   chest pain. This would be compatible with the picture of pericarditis.
   However, treatment cannot be given in the setting of low platelets. In
   the other hand, patient presented with sudden pain and with
   bradycardia, which may suggest esophageal spasm with posterior
   vaso-vagal in the setting of low intravascular volume, mostly in a
   patient with history of bad reflux and GI ulcers. Another possibility
   is anxiety or TRAP.
   -          Follow homodynamic parameters
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] be able to go to floor if stable in PM
   -          Measure CVP; goal [**4-26**].
   -          Fluids if hypotensive
   -          Continue antibiotics for now (cefepime for neutropenia in
   setting of possible infection)
   -          Continue levofloxacin for UTI
   # Thomrobycotpenia: transfuse with a goal of >10,000
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -discuss w/ BMT team in a.m. further management for the patient's
   lymphoma
   .
   # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10.
   .
   # FEN:  regular diet, PPI as above

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Chest pain and hypotension: Follow hemodynamic parameters, measure CVP, and consider fluid resuscitation.
* Thrombocytopenia: Transfuse platelets to a goal of >10,000.
* Infectious disease: Continue antibiotics (cefepime) for neutropenia and possible infection.
* Gastrointestinal: Continue sucralfate and PPI for lymphoma ulcer.
* Lymphoma: Discuss further management with the BMT team.
* Anemia: Treat Hb < 21 and Plt < 10.
* Fluid and electrolyte management: Monitor and adjust as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac tamponade due to pericarditis
* Esophageal perforation or bleeding
* Hypotension and shock due to blood loss or sepsis
* Infection due to neutropenia and possible sepsis
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to lymphoma ulcer
* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Anemia and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalance due to fluid and electrolyte management
* Cardiovascular instability due to cardiac tamponade or other cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a multi-lumen catheter in place and has received cefepime antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count may indicate an infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Bleeding: The patient's decreased platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, especially if the patient's underlying condition worsens.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's chest pain and elevated troponin-T level may indicate cardiac injury, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal dysfunction, which can worsen with continued fluid overload.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 194 mL over 24 hours, which may indicate fluid overload and increase the risk of respiratory and cardiac complications.
7. Catheter-related complications: The patient's multi-lumen catheter may be at risk for complications such as catheter-associated blood stream infections or catheter-related thrombosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of platelet transfusion. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Central venous pressure: 14 mmHg
* Mixed venous oxygen saturation: 62%

The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension, which has not responded to treatment. She has been receiving stress dose steroids, vancomycin, and cefepime for febrile neutropenia. The patient's blood cultures have grown two organisms, but the results are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Hyperdynamic pulse, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and a rub
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 0.3-0.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.4-9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 10-19 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mEq/L
* Serum glucose: 129-147 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is likely sepsis secondary to febrile neutropenia, and the potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy
* Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury
* Sepsis-induced respiratory failure
* Sepsis-induced coagulopathy
* Sepsis-induced hypoglycemia
* Sepsis-induced adrenal insufficiency

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her sepsis, including administration of antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care. Further evaluation and management of her underlying lymphoma and platelet dysfunction are also necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - given one dose stress dose steroid 50 IV yesterday, will continue at
   stress dose levels for now given hypotension, also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis
   - had to be restarted on iv levofed yesterday evening for blood
   pressures of 80s to maintain MAPs > 60, attempted to wean x4 but was
   unsuccessful, will attempt to wean again today
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis
   - added vancomycin yesterday in the setting of possible new infiltrate
   on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or alternatively and more
   likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking deep breaths secondary
   to pain
   -blood cultures pending
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   -Central venous line placed
   -maintained CVP of [**10-1**] even during repeated episodes of hypotension
   - AM CVP was 13
   - will check SvO2 again today and consider additional blood transfusion
   if low as crit still remains 24 in the setting of hypotension on
   pressors
   - follow-up with repeat EKG
   .# ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -BMT recs to start iv steroids and possibly cover for pnuemonia as
   above, will follow-up with new thoughts today
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade.  Pain may also be secondary to esophageal spasms in the
   setting of gastric ulcer and radiation, however this clinically does
   not fit with hypotension.   Another possibility is that patient is
   anxious and this represents a manifestation of that, however again this
   doesn
t clinically fit with hypotesnsion.
   -repeat EKG from yesterday looks the same as previous, put in for
   official ekg this am and will follow-up with results
   -prelim read CTA chest .
   No PE in main, lobar or segmental branches. Small pericardial effusion
   is
   new. No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   Appearance of the stomach similar with prominent folds. No acute
   abdominal
   process.
   -pain possibly related to gastric ulcer, however less likely given
   location
   -enzymes negative, telemetry monitoring, started tylenol for pain,
   cannot give aspirin given thrombocytopenia, in addition increased
   oxycodone dosing to 10 mg PO PRN
   -in addition patient felt anxious during this episode so this may be a
   possibility, and her pain initially improved w/ ativan
   .
   # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10
   - this Am platelets are 10, no active signs of bleed, will send PM CBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) despite multiple treatment courses. She presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of platelet transfusion.

The patient has persistent hypotension, which is a concern for various potential causes, including distributive, obstructive, cardiogenic, adrenal insufficiency, or anaphylactic shock. The patient has received platelets and magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, but hypotension can occur with IV magnesium, especially if it is prolonged.

The patient has also received a stress dose of steroids, which may help with inflammation if she has clinical evidence of pericarditis. She has been started on vancomycin and cefepime for broader coverage in the setting of febrile neutropenia. Levofed has been restarted to maintain blood pressures above 60 mmHg.

The patient's chest pain is concerning for pericarditis, and her EKG shows diffuse ST elevations. She has a small but new pericardial effusion on chest CT and echo. Her troponins were negative, ruling out cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results show neutropenia, with a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 10. Her hemoglobin is 8.4 g/dL, and her lactate is 21 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is significant for hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has febrile neutropenia, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a new infiltrate on chest x-ray, which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
3. Pericarditis: The patient's chest pain and EKG changes suggest the possibility of pericarditis.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol level is 3, which is low, and her [**Last Name (un) **] stim test result is 24, which indicates relative adrenal insufficiency.
5. Anaphylaxis: The patient's hypotension may be caused by an anaphylactic reaction to the platelet transfusion or another medication.
6. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's troponins were negative, but her EKG shows diffuse ST elevations, which may indicate cardiogenic shock.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD, which increases her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Monitoring her blood pressure and adjusting her treatment as necessary.
2. Continuing her antibiotics and antifungal medications.
3. Repeating her EKG and chest x-ray to monitor for any changes.
4. Considering additional blood transfusions if her SvO2 is low.
5. Following up with her oncologist to discuss further treatment options.

The patient's disposition is ICU until her blood pressure normalizes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   an includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic,
   anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and magnesium prior
   to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with IV magnesium
   however this was prolonged and after the infusion had stopped and the
   hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills / rigors or other
   symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but had also rec'd
   10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.  Transfusion reaction
   would not be expected to cause hypotension unless it were of an
   anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such as
   respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and low grade temp of 99.6 infection is a
   possibility.  CTA was negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative
   ruling out cardiogenic as a process. EKG with diffuse ST elevations
   however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect clinically
   pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level measured
   yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which is adequate
   bump.
   - given one dose stress dose steroid 50 IV yesterday, changed to
   solumedrol 20 IV BID because [**Last Name (un) **] stim test showed appropriate
   response, also suspect that iv steroids will help with inflammation if
   patient with clinical evidence of pericarditis
   - had to be restarted on iv levofed yesterday evening for blood
   pressures of 80s to maintain MAPs > 60, attempted to wean x4 but was
   unsuccessful, will attempt to wean again today
   -UA neg LE or nitrate with 1 WBC, UTI unlikely
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic fever
   (hypotension)
   - added vancomycin yesterday in the setting of possible new infiltrate
   on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or alternatively and more
   likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking deep breaths secondary
   to pain
   -blood cultures pending
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   -Central venous line placed
   -maintained CVP of [**10-1**] even during repeated episodes of hypotension
   .
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .
   # GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   -BMT recs to start iv steroids and possibly cover for pnuemonia as
   above, will follow-up with new thoughts today
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade.  Pain may also be secondary to esophageal spasms in the
   setting of gastric ulcer and radiation, however this clinically does
   not fit with hypotension.   Another possibility is that patient is
   anxious and this represents a manifestation of that, however again this
   doesn
t clinically fit with hypotesnsion.
   -repeat EKG from yesterday looks the same as previous, put in for
   official ekg this am and will follow-up with results
   -prelim read CTA chest .
   No PE in main, lobar or segmental branches. Small pericardial effusion
   is
   new. No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
   Appearance of the stomach similar with prominent folds. No acute
   abdominal
   process.
   -pain possibly related to gastric ulcer, however less likely given
   location
   -enzymes negative, telemetry monitoring, started tylenol for pain,
   cannot give aspirin given thrombocytopenia, in addition increased
   oxycodone dosing to 10 mg PO PRN
   -in addition patient felt anxious during this episode so this may be a
   possibility, and her pain initially improved w/ ativan
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Did [**Last Name (un) **] stim test. Started patient on 1 x stress dose steroids. as
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was normal decided to continue treatment with lower dose
   steroids 20 IV solumedral [**Hospital1 **].   repeat chest x-ray demonstrated some
   left heart border opacification which may represent atelectastis vs.
   pnuemonia.  Patient was started on vancomycin in addition to cefepime
   for broader coverage in the setting of febrile neutropenia. Patient
   also was started on levofed drip.  attempted 4 times to come off
   overnigth but was unsuccessful as pressures would continue to drop into

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) despite multiple treatment courses, who presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of platelet transfusion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 64 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 109/64 mmHg (75/41 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 96%
* CVP: 14 mmHg
* Mixed venous O2% Sat: 62-62%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* No acute distress
* Hyperdynamic pulse
* Clear breath sounds
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm skin
* Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, time, and place

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 0.3-0.8 K/uL
* Hct: 23.1-24.4%
* Plt: 10-19 K/uL
* Cr: 0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 129-147 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is broad, including distributive, obstructive, cardiogenic, and anaphylactic shock. The patient was receiving platelets and magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, and hypotension can occur with IV magnesium. However, this was prolonged and after the infusion had stopped, and the hypotension would be rate-related. No chills, rigors, or other symptoms/signs to signify transfusion reaction, but had also received 10 mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.

Given the patient's neutropenia and low-grade temperature, infection is a possibility. CTA was negative for signs of PE, and troponins were negative, ruling out cardiogenic shock. The patient's EKG showed diffuse ST elevations, but no evidence for tamponade on echo. The patient is suspected to have clinically pericarditis, given the clinical presentation, and cortisol level measured yesterday afternoon was 3, with [**Last Name (un) **] stim test going to 24, which is adequate.

The patient's plan includes:

* Stress dose steroids for possible pericarditis
* IV levofed for blood pressure support
* Vancomycin for possible new infiltrate on chest x-ray
* Mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan, and galactomannan for immune suppression
* Central venous line placement
* Maintenance of CVP
* Lymphoma treatment, including BMT recommendations
* GI treatment for lymphoma ulcer
* Pain management with tylenol and oxycodone
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, and bacteremia
* Cardiogenic shock, including tamponade and cardiomyopathy
* Pericarditis, including effusion and tamponade
* Anaphylactic shock, including transfusion reaction and medication reaction
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, including perforation and hemorrhage
* Neurological complications, including seizures and stroke
* Respiratory failure, including ARDS and pneumonia
* Renal failure, including AKI and ESRD

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and optimize her care."

   HPI:
   Overnight started on low-dose pressors [**12-20**] refractory hypotension --
   nadired at SBP ~70 in late afternoon. CVP ~11 at this time, increased
   to 13. Vanc was added given concern for possible left basilar pneumonia
   from chest x-ray overnight.
   She received one unit of pRBCs last night with Hct 24%. Her central
   venous sat yesterday evening was 62%, as well, which prompted the
   transfusion.
   Underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-stim test -- time zero her cortisol was 4, increased
   to 23 after ACTH. Received Hydrocortisone 50mg x 1 overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 51yo woman with NHL now day 16 s/p ICE chemo admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] yesterday with hypotension and chest pain. Chest pain does not
   appear to be ischemic in nature
 she has ruled out for a MI with
   serial enzymes. Pericarditis is a possibility but it is difficult to
   rectify this with her persistent hypotension.
   1)Hypotension: No e/o obstructive physiology as TTE and CTA do not
   reveal tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility, however,
   she has ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her TTE doesn
t reveal
   any RWMAs. Infection is a possibiility and she is on broad spectrum
   antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) in the setting of her chemo-induced
   neutropenia. Her chest x-ray has a suggestion of a left basilar process
   that may be unimpressive given that she is neutropenic and unable to
   mount a significant inflammatory response. Will follow serial imaging,
   blood and putum cultures and continue empiric antbiotics at this time.
   Hypovolemia may be playing a role, however her CVP is [**10-1**]. She is s/p
   a blood transfusion last night without an expected increase in her Hct.
   No e/o acute blood loss. Will recheck SvO2 again this morning (was 62%
   last night) and transfuse again today if it remains <70%. Finally, her
   random cortisol was 4 yesterday c/w adrenal insufficiency; will dose
   her with stress-dose steroids and follow. Attempt to wean pressors as
   tolerated.
   -If no obvious rapid resolution will have to consider arterial catheter
   for truly accurate ABP monitoring given
   2)Chest Pain: Appears to have improved with increased analgesia.
   Although dificult to determine actual primary source
certainly to link
   it with the hypotension one is concerned about possible myocardial or
   pericardial involvement but on ECHO and CT that has not proven to be
   clear source at this time.  ECG is not changed from yesterday.
   -Expect improvement with in pericarditis with Hydrocortisone at 50mg q
   6 hours
   -Will re-review CT scan findings with radiology
   3) Anemia / thrombocytopenia: Will transfuse if SvO2 remains low this
   morning. Hold on platelets if she has e/o active bleeding or if
   platelets decrease to less than 10.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet. Follow / replete
lytes. No need for standing
   IVF.
   5) Access: Right IJ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 51yo woman with NHL now day 16 s/p ICE chemo admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] yesterday with hypotension and chest pain. Chest pain does not
   appear to be ischemic in nature
 she has ruled out for a MI with
   serial enzymes. Pericarditis is a possibility but it is difficult to
   rectify this with her persistent hypotension.
   1)Hypotension: No e/o obstructive physiology as TTE and CTA do not
   reveal tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility, however,
   she has ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her TTE doesn
t reveal
   any RWMAs. Infection is a possibiility and she is on broad spectrum
   antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) in the setting of her chemo-induced
   neutropenia. Her chest x-ray has a suggestion of a left basilar process
   that may be unimpressive given that she is neutropenic and unable to
   mount a significant inflammatory response. Will follow serial imaging,
   blood and putum cultures and continue empiric antbiotics at this time.
   Hypovolemia may be playing a role, however her CVP is [**10-1**]. She is s/p
   a blood transfusion last night without an expected increase in her Hct.
   No e/o acute blood loss. Will recheck SvO2 again this morning (was 62%
   last night) and transfuse again today if it remains <70%. Finally, her
   random cortisol was 4 yesterday c/w adrenal insufficiency; will dose
   her with stress-dose steroids and follow. Attempt to wean pressors as
   tolerated.
   -If no obvious rapid resolution will have to consider arterial catheter
   for truly accurate ABP monitoring given
   2)Chest Pain: Appears to have improved with increased analgesia.
   Although dificult to determine actual primary source
certainly to link
   it with the hypotension one is concerned about possible myocardial or
   pericardial involvement but on ECHO and CT that has not proven to be
   clear source at this time.  ECG is not changed from yesterday.
   -Expect improvement with in pericarditis with Hydrocortisone at 50mg q
   6 hours
   -Will re-review CT scan findings with radiology
   3) Anemia / thrombocytopenia: Will transfuse if SvO2 remains low this
   morning. Hold on platelets if she has e/o active bleeding or if
   platelets decrease to less than 10.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet. Follow / replete
lytes. No need for standing
   IVF.
   5) Access: Right IJ.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with hypotension and chest pain. She has been treated with low-dose pressors and has received a blood transfusion last night. She has also been started on antibiotics for possible infection, including vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, and respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 19 K/uL. Her blood cultures are negative, and her chest x-ray shows essentially clear lungs with mild blunting of the left costo-phrenic angle.

The patient's medical history includes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and she has received ICE chemotherapy. She has also been treated with corticosteroids for possible adrenal insufficiency.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension and chest pain may be related to cardiogenic shock, which is a possibility given her recent chemotherapy and potential cardiac involvement.
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and recent chemotherapy may increase her risk of infection, which could be related to her chest pain and hypotension.
3. Pericarditis: The patient's chest pain and ECG changes may be related to pericarditis, which could be caused by her recent chemotherapy or infection.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's random cortisol level was 4, which suggests adrenal insufficiency. She has been started on stress-dose steroids, but her cortisol level may need to be monitored to ensure adequate replacement.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient's CVP is 22 mmHg, which may indicate hypovolemia. She has received a blood transfusion, but her SvO2 level was only 62% last night, which may indicate ongoing hypovolemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results to assess for any changes in her condition.
2. Maintenance of her blood pressure with low-dose pressors and blood transfusions as needed.
3. Continued antibiotics for possible infection, including vancomycin and cefepime.
4. Monitoring of her SvO2 level to assess for any changes in her hypovolemia.
5. Consideration of arterial catheter placement for truly accurate ABP monitoring.
6. Review of her CT scan findings with radiology to assess for any changes in her condition.
7. Regular diet and repletion of electrolytes as needed.
8. No need for standing IV fluids."

   HPI:
   Overnight started on low-dose pressors [**12-20**] refractory hypotension --
   nadired at SBP ~70 in late afternoon. CVP ~11 at this time, increased
   to 13. Vanc was added given concern for possible left basilar pneumonia
   from chest x-ray overnight.
   She received one unit of pRBCs last night with Hct 24%. Her central
   venous sat yesterday evening was 62%, as well, which prompted the
   transfusion.
   Underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-stim test -- time zero her cortisol was 4, increased
   to 23 after ACTH. Received Hydrocortisone 50mg x 1 overnight.
   Finally she was started on Tylenol for pain and her PRN oxycodone was
   increased for persistent chest pain.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension. She was started on low-dose pressors and received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to a hemoglobin level of 24%. She also underwent a stimulation test, which showed a cortisol level of 23 after ACTH administration. The patient was started on hydrocortisone and increased PRN oxycodone for persistent chest pain. She received vancomycin for possible left basilar pneumonia and was also started on tylenol for pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen delivery device used. Her physical examination is unremarkable, except for a pale conjunctiva and mild blunting of the left costo-phrenic angle on chest x-ray.

Lab results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 23.1 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 19 K/uL. Her white blood cell count is normal, with a differential showing 60% neutrophils, 27% lymphocytes, and 0% eosinophils. Her troponin-T level is <0.01, and her creatine kinase (CK) level is 147 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of NHL and is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia, which is suspected based on the chest x-ray findings.
3. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or trauma.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her respiratory status deteriorates.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin-T level is normal, but she may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, given her underlying NHL and potential cardiac involvement.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly with stress ulcer prophylaxis.
7. Central venous catheter-related complications: The patient has a central venous catheter in place, which can increase the risk of complications, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or catheter occlusion."

   HPI:
   Overnight started on low-dose pressors [**12-20**] refractory hypotension --
   nadired at SBP ~70 in late afternoon. CVP ~11 at this time, increased
   to 13. Vanc was added given concern for possible left basilar pneumonia
   from chest x-ray overnight.
   She received one unit of pRBCs last night with Hct 24%. Her central
   venous sat yesterday evening was 62%, as well, which prompted the
   transfusion.
   Underwent [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-stim test -- time zero her cortisol was 4, increased
   to 23 after ACTH. Received Hydrocortisone 50mg x 1 overnight.
   Finally she was started on Tylenol for pain and her PRN oxycodone was
   increased for persistent chest pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression: 51yo woman with NHL now day 16 s/p ICE chemo admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] yesterday with hypotension and chest pain. Chest pain does not
   appear to be ischemic in nature
 she has ruled out for a MI with
   serial enzymes. Pericarditis is a possibility but it is difficult to
   rectify this with her persistent hypotension.
   1)Hypotension: No e/o obstructive physiology as TTE and CTA do not
   reveal tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility, however,
   she has ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her TTE doesn
t reveal
   any RWMAs. Infection is a possibiility and she is on broad spectrum
   antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) in the setting of her chemo-induced
   neutropenia. Her chest x-ray has a suggestion of a left basilar process
   that may be unimpressive given that she is neutropenic and unable to
   mount a significant inflammatory response. Will follow serial imaging,
   blood and putum cultures and continue empiric antbiotics at this time.
   Hypovolemia may be playing a role, however her CVP is [**10-1**]. She is s/p
   a blood transfusion last night without an expected increase in her Hct.
   No e/o acute blood loss. Will recheck SvO2 again this morning (was 62%
   last night) and transfuse again today if it remains <70%. Finally, her
   random cortisol was 4 yesterday c/w adrenal insufficiency; will dose
   her with stress-dose steroids and follow. Attempt to wean pressors as
   tolerated.
   2)Chest Pain: Appears to have improved with increased analgesia.
   Although dificult
   3) Anemia / thrombocytopenia: Will transfuse if SvO2 remains low this
   morning. Hold on platelets if she has e/o active bleeding or if
   platelets decrease to less than 10.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet. Follow / replete
lytes. No need for standing
   IVF.
   5) Access: Right IJ.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Impression: 51yo woman with NHL now day 16 s/p ICE chemo admitted to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] yesterday with hypotension and chest pain. Chest pain does not
   appear to be ischemic in nature
 she has ruled out for a MI with
   serial enzymes. Pericarditis is a possibility but it is difficult to
   rectify this with her persistent hypotension.
   1)Hypotension: No e/o obstructive physiology as TTE and CTA do not
   reveal tamponade or PE. Cardiogenic shock is a possibility, however,
   she has ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and her TTE doesn
t reveal
   any RWMAs. Infection is a possibiility and she is on broad spectrum
   antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) in the setting of her chemo-induced
   neutropenia. Her chest x-ray has a suggestion of a left basilar process
   that may be unimpressive given that she is neutropenic and unable to
   mount a significant inflammatory response. Will follow serial imaging,
   blood and putum cultures and continue empiric antbiotics at this time.
   Hypovolemia may be playing a role, however her CVP is [**10-1**]. She is s/p
   a blood transfusion last night without an expected increase in her Hct.
   No e/o acute blood loss. Will recheck SvO2 again this morning (was 62%
   last night) and transfuse again today if it remains <70%. Finally, her
   random cortisol was 4 yesterday c/w adrenal insufficiency; will dose
   her with stress-dose steroids and follow. Attempt to wean pressors as
   tolerated.
   2)Chest Pain: Appears to have improved with increased analgesia.
   Although dificult
   3) Anemia / thrombocytopenia: Will transfuse if SvO2 remains low this
   morning. Hold on platelets if she has e/o active bleeding or if
   platelets decrease to less than 10.
   4) F/E/N: Regular diet. Follow / replete
lytes. No need for standing
   IVF.
   5) Access: Right IJ.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who has been admitted to the ICU for 16 days following ICE chemotherapy. The patient's main complaints are hypotension and chest pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 95/56 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 22 mmHg, and her mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 62%.

The patient has undergone various tests and procedures, including echocardiography, computed tomography angiography (CTA), and blood cultures. The results of these tests suggest that the patient may have pericarditis, but it is difficult to confirm this diagnosis due to her persistent hypotension.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to her anemia and thrombocytopenia. She is also receiving hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency and is being treated with pain medication for her chest pain.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). Her troponin-T levels are normal, and her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show essentially clear lungs on chest x-ray, but there is mild blunting of the left costo-phrenic angle. The patient's microbiology results are negative.

Based on the patient's condition and test results, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and normal cardiac enzymes suggest that cardiogenic shock is a possibility. However, the patient's CVP is within normal limits, and her echocardiogram did not reveal any right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMAs).
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and broad-spectrum antibiotics suggest that infection is a possibility. The patient's chest x-ray shows a suggestion of a left basilar process, but it is difficult to confirm this diagnosis due to her neutropenic state.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's random cortisol level was 4, which suggests adrenal insufficiency. The patient is being treated with hydrocortisone, but it is essential to monitor her cortisol levels to ensure that she is receiving adequate treatment.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely related to her chemotherapy and bone marrow suppression. The patient may require further transfusions to manage her anemia and thrombocytopenia.
5. Pericarditis: The patient's chest pain and echocardiogram suggest that pericarditis is a possibility. However, it is difficult to confirm this diagnosis due to her persistent hypotension.

In conclusion, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with NHL who has been admitted to the ICU for 16 days following ICE chemotherapy. She has persistent hypotension, chest pain, and anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being treated for adrenal insufficiency. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal LFTs. The patient's imaging studies show essentially clear lungs, but there is mild blunting of the left costo-phrenic angle. The patient's microbiology results are negative. The patient's condition is complex, and further monitoring and treatment are necessary to manage her symptoms and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started PM [**8-11**], also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or
   alternatively and more likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking
   deep breaths secondary to pain
   -blood cultures now growing yeast unspeciated in one bottle - consider
   adding anti-fungal coverage in addition
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   - SvO2 yesterday 61
   - EKG from [**8-11**] - ST-T wave configuration suggests acute
   injury/possible pericarditis
   Clinical correlation is suggested. Since previous tracing of the same
   date, no significant change
   - repeat echo [**8-12**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a very small
   circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   - chest x-ray from [**8-12**] - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-11**],
   there is little change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette since the study of [**8-10**]. This is consistent with the small
   pericardial effusion seen on the CT scan of [**8-10**]. Left pleural effusion
   and retrocardiac opacification persists. Right central catheter remains
   in place.
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .# GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   - cont to follow new onc recs
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade on 2 consecutive echos.  Pain may also be secondary to
   esophageal spasms in the setting of gastric ulcer and radiation,
   however this clinically does not fit with hypotension.   Another
   possibility is that patient is anxious and this represents a
   manifestation of that, however again this doesn
t clinically fit with
   hypotesnsion. Pain may also be related to gastric process. Enzymes
   negative. Tylenol changed to PRN with LFT abnormalities, cannot give
   aspirin secondary to thrombocytopenia.
   - final read CTA
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Interval development of small pericardial effusion.
   2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
   3. Redemonstration of confluent soft tissue mass that appears to arise
   from
   the lesser curvature of the stomach and extends to surround the celiac
   axis,
   4. Left adrenal mass.
   5. Hypoattenuating splenic lesion stable.
   - cont oxycodone and tylenol PRN for pain
    # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10
   - this Am platelets are 6, no active signs of bleed, however will
   require platelet transfusion this morning

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started PM [**8-11**], also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or
   alternatively and more likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking
   deep breaths secondary to pain
   -blood cultures now growing yeast unspeciated in one bottle - consider
   adding anti-fungal coverage in addition
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple
   rounds of chemotherapy and immune suppression pending
   - SvO2 yesterday 61
   - EKG from [**8-11**] - ST-T wave configuration suggests acute
   injury/possible pericarditis
   Clinical correlation is suggested. Since previous tracing of the same
   date, no significant change
   - repeat echo [**8-12**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a very small
   circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   - chest x-ray from [**8-12**] - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-11**],
   there is little change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette since the study of [**8-10**]. This is consistent with the small
   pericardial effusion seen on the CT scan of [**8-10**]. Left pleural effusion
   and retrocardiac opacification persists. Right central catheter remains
   in place.
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .# GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   - cont to follow new onc recs
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade on 2 consecutive echos.  Pain may also be secondary to
   esophageal spasms in the setting of gastric ulcer and radiation,
   however this clinically does not fit with hypotension.   Another
   possibility is that patient is anxious and this represents a
   manifestation of that, however again this doesn
t clinically fit with
   hypotesnsion. Pain may also be related to gastric process. Enzymes
   negative. Tylenol changed to PRN with LFT abnormalities, cannot give
   aspirin secondary to thrombocytopenia.
   - final read CTA
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Interval development of small pericardial effusion.
   2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
   3. Redemonstration of confluent soft tissue mass that appears to arise
   from
   the lesser curvature of the stomach and extends to surround the celiac
   axis,
   4. Left adrenal mass.
   5. Hypoattenuating splenic lesion stable.
   - cont oxycodone and tylenol PRN for pain
    # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone multiple treatment courses. She is currently in the ICU due to chest pain and hypotension, which occurred during a platelet transfusion.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Neutropenia (ANC 0.3 K/uL)
* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 6)
* Elevated troponin levels (0.01 ng/mL)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (160 IU/L)
* Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (78.0%)
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) (1.2 K/uL)
* Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (26 mEq/L)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, left pleural effusion, and retrocardiac opacification
* CT scan: Small pericardial effusion, left adrenal mass, and hypoattenuating splenic lesion

The patient's clinical presentation is concerning for pericarditis, given the diffuse ST segment changes on her EKG and the small pericardial effusion on her echocardiogram. The patient's hypotension may be related to her pericarditis, adrenal insufficiency, or sepsis. The patient's platelet count is low, which may be contributing to her bleeding risk.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Stress dose hydrocortisone to treat possible relative adrenal insufficiency
* Fludrocortisone to help with inflammation and pericarditis
* Antibiotics for possible infection, including vancomycin and cefepime
* Anti-fungal coverage for possible fungal infection
* Anti-anxiety medication to manage anxiety and pain
* Pain management with oxycodone and tylenol PRN
* Platelet transfusion to increase platelet count
* Anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and VTE

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her underlying lymphoma and the complexity of her medical condition. She will require close monitoring and management in the ICU to address her hypotension, pericarditis, and potential sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes septic, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency.  Patient now with + blood culture for [**Female First Name (un) 474**].  Given
   neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo which was repeated
   yesterday. Cortisol level prior to [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was 3 which is low.
   With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which indicates likely relative adrenal
   insufficiency in a patient who has been on steroids in the past for
   chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started evening of [**8-11**], also suspect
   that iv steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical
   evidence of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in
   addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed since yesterday PM
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, however given + blood culture for
   [**Female First Name (un) 474**] will d/c anti-bacterial agents at this time
   - start caspofugin 70 IV today, then 50 IV q daily starting tomorrow
   morning for [**Female First Name (un) 474**] albicans
   - SvO2 yesterday 61
   - repeat echo [**8-12**] - Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
   global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is a very small
   circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   #) Pulm
   Patient with evidence of what appears to be volume overload on chest
   x-ray with fluid on right side. Suspect that likely from extensive
   fluid resuscitation as well as blood administration.
   -          will hold off on additional fluids at this time, try to
   minimize fluids in
   -          - try 20 IV lasix today
   # ID: as above in addition continue acyclovir and nystatin for
   neutropenic prophylaxis.
   .# GI: lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.
   -no perforation per CT abdomen
   -continue sucralfate and PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Lymphoma: DLBCL which has progressed through multiple courses of
   chemotherapy.
   - cont to follow new onc recs
   .
   # Chest pain: Patient with repeated episode of chest pain in the same
   locatin which is worse with inspiration.  Pain is concerning for
   pericarditis, the patient also has a small but new pericardial effusion
   on chest CT and echo.  Also with diffuse ST segment changes.
   Hypotensive but pulsus is 4 and echo is negative for any signs of
   tamponade on 2 consecutive echos.  Pain may also be secondary to
   esophageal spasms in the setting of gastric ulcer and radiation,
   however this clinically does not fit with hypotension.   Another
   possibility is that patient is anxious and this represents a
   manifestation of that, however again this doesn
t clinically fit with
   hypotesnsion. Pain may also be related to gastric process. Enzymes
   negative. Tylenol changed to PRN with LFT abnormalities, cannot give
   aspirin secondary to thrombocytopenia.
   - final read CTA  1. Interval development of small pericardial
   effusion.  2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
   3. Redemonstration of confluent soft tissue mass that appears to arise
   from
   the lesser curvature of the stomach and extends to surround the celiac
   axis,  4. Left adrenal mass.  5. Hypoattenuating splenic lesion stable.
   - cont oxycodone and tylenol PRN for pain
    # ANEMIA: tx for hct < 21.  tx plts < 10
   -          this Am platelets are 6, no active signs of bleed, however
   will require platelet transfusion this morning
   -          - will check afternoon platlets after transfusion, consider
   repeat transfusion as needed

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of progressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of platelet transfusion. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg. She has a small pericardial effusion on chest CT and echo, and her troponin levels are negative, ruling out cardiogenic shock.

The patient has a positive blood culture for Candida albicans, and her neutrophil count is low. She has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, and has a negative EKG with diffuse ST elevations.

The patient's laboratory results show a low cortisol level, indicating relative adrenal insufficiency. She has been started on stress dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.

The patient's chest x-ray shows a right-sided effusion, and her abdominal CT scan shows a lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's positive blood culture for Candida albicans and her neutrophil count of 0.3 K/uL indicate a high risk for sepsis.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol level and her history of steroid use for chemotherapy indicate a risk for adrenal insufficiency.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's chest pain and hypotension could be related to cardiogenic shock, but her troponin levels are negative, ruling out this diagnosis.
4. Pericarditis: The patient's small pericardial effusion on chest CT and echo, and her diffuse ST elevations on EKG, suggest a possibility of pericarditis.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's chest x-ray shows a right-sided effusion, and her WBC count is low, indicating a possibility of pneumonia.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's lymphoma ulcer on recent EGD and her low platelet count indicate a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Stress dose hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
2. Antibiotics for sepsis, including vancomycin and caspofungin.
3. Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia.
4. Fluid management to minimize volume overload.
5. Pain management with oxycodone and tylenol PRN.
6. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and pericarditis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started PM [**8-11**], also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or
   alternatively and more likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking
   deep breaths secondary to pain
   -blood cultures now growing yeast unspeciated in one bottle - consider

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: 51 yoF w/ a h/o progressive DLBCL despite multiple treatment
   courses presents with chest pain and hypotension in the setting of plt
   transfusion.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOTENSION: In terms of causes for hypotension differential is broad
   and includes distributive, obstructive shock, cardiogenic, adrenal
   insufficiency or anaphylactic.  The patient was receiving platelets and
   magnesium prior to her hypotensive episode, hypotension can occur with
   IV magnesium however this was prolonged and after the infusion had
   stopped and the hypotension in would be rate related.  No chills /
   rigors or other symptoms / signs to signify transfusion reaction but
   had also rec'd 10mg dexamethasone prior to transfer to ICU.
   Transfusion reaction would not be expected to cause hypotension unless
   it were of an anaphylactic variety and in that case other symptoms such
   as respiratory distress may be notable.
   Given neutropenia and new infiltrate on chest x-ray pneumonia  is also
   possibility.  UA unremarkable so UTI is unlikely source. CTA was
   negative for signs of PE. Troponins were negative ruling out
   cardiogenic etiology leading to hypotension. EKG with diffuse ST
   elevations however no evidence for tamponade on echo. Suspect
   clinically pericarditis given clinical presentation. Cortisol level
   measured yesterday afternoon was 3. With [**Last Name (un) **] stim went to 24 which
   indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency in a patient who has
   been on steroids in the past for chemotherapy.
   - on stress dose hydrocortisone started PM [**8-11**], also suspect that iv
   steroids will help with inflammation if patient with clinical evidence
   of pericarditis, also on [**8-12**] started on fludrocort in addition
   - s/p another 1 unit pRBC yesterday
   - off levofed
   -started initially on cefepime for empiric for neutropenic hypotension
   and concern for sepsis, added vancomycin  in the setting of possible
   new infiltrate on chest x-ray, may represent infection, or
   alternatively and more likely atelectasis in the setting of not taking
   deep breaths secondary to pain
   -blood cultures now growing yeast unspeciated in one bottle - consider
   adding anti-fungal coverage in addition
   -mycolitic blood cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan given multiple

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood culture is positive for yeast, and they have a history of neutropenia, which increases their risk of developing sepsis.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's cortisol level was 3, which indicates likely relative adrenal insufficiency, especially given their history of steroid use for chemotherapy.
3. Pericarditis: The patient's chest pain, diffuse ST segment changes on EKG, and small pericardial effusion on echocardiogram suggest pericarditis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's new infiltrate on chest x-ray and neutropenia make pneumonia a possible diagnosis.
5. Tamponade: Although the echocardiogram did not show signs of tamponade, the patient's hypotension and chest pain warrant close monitoring for this possibility.
6. Anaphylactic Reaction: The patient's history of skin reactions to cefepime and rash make an anaphylactic reaction a possible cause of their hypotension.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastric ulcer and history of radiation therapy increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 6, which increases their risk of bleeding and requires close monitoring.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which can lead to arrhythmias and other complications.
10. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and history of chemotherapy make them susceptible to infection, and their positive blood culture suggests a possible infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Stress dose hydrocortisone to manage adrenal insufficiency
2. Antibiotics for sepsis and pneumonia
3. Anti-fungal coverage for yeast in blood culture
4. Pain management with oxycodone and tylenol PRN
5. Platelet transfusion to manage thrombocytopenia
6. Monitoring for signs of tamponade and pericarditis
7. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and acid-base balance
8. Continuation of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy
9. Regular diet and PPI for gastrointestinal prophylaxis
10. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female admitted to the ICU with chest pain and paroxysms of hypotension requiring IV pressor support. The patient's condition has been stable with no clear evidence of myocardial or peri-cardial insult.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.7°F)
* Heart rate: 66 bpm (59-75 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 125/63 mmHg (79-91/49-59 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (12-21 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 1.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 19 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 147 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Bilateral peri-hilar fullness and suggestion of right-sided effusion
* ECHO: No change in hemodynamic parameters

The patient's medical complications include:

* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has been responsive to increased volume and ECHO. The patient is being treated for fungal infection with suggestion of candidemia as a potential player.
* Chest pain: The patient's chest pain is likely related to gastrointestinal spasm or gastritis, but the exact cause is unclear.
* Pulmonary edema: The patient has subtle dyspnea and pulmonary edema noted on CXR.
* Fungal infection: The patient has a single positive blood culture for yeast, suggesting a potential fungal infection.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing IV pressor support
* Treating for fungal infection with caspofungin
* Moving to negative fluid balance
* Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Continuing cardiac enzyme monitoring to rule out myocardial injury
* Considering stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor
* Considering DVT prophylaxis with heparin
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction"
