   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   - Call IP for new custom made trach to avoid future movement of trach.
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - not giving colistin now.  If febrile again, c/s ID and discuss adding
   colistin.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   -restart coumadin once INR <3.
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently readmitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. He has chronic renal failure and is on tobramycin and vancomycin for resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP. He also has chronic pain, impaired skin integrity, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's 24-hour events include bronchoscopy to reposition his tracheostomy tube, which improved his ventilation and ABG. He was taken off pressors since midnight and is currently on vitamin K for INR correction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 102/58 mmHg. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's labs show elevated INR, with a value of 7.4, and chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL. His WBC count is 12.8 K/uL, and his platelet count is 136 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory disease and hypercarbic respiratory failure put him at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure and ongoing use of nephrotoxic medications, such as tobramycin, put him at risk for further renal damage.
3. Infection: The patient's resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP and elevated INR put him at risk for further infections.
4. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and recent bleeding from his tracheostomy site put him at risk for further bleeding complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension put him at risk for further cardiovascular complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's chronic illness and recent hospitalization put him at risk for nutritional deficiencies.
7. Skin integrity issues: The patient's chronic illness and recent hospitalization put him at risk for skin integrity issues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his medications as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust his medications as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust his diet as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and adjust his care plan as needed."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - consider add colistin after discussion with renal and ID, hold for
   now.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - consider add colistin after discussion with renal and ID, hold for
   now.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF, now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly after repositioning of trach with bronchoscopy, with ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. The goal PCO2 is in the 70s-80s.

The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, likely due to hypovolemia vs infection. The patient is currently normotensive, off pressors since midnight. The plan is to hold pressors unless MAPs <55, continue fluid boluses prn, and continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level, and hold off on colistin.

The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which persisted on repeat cx, sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin was sent to an outside lab, but sensitivity results are not available. The patient is currently on tobramycin and will continue to receive it.

The patient's INR is elevated, unclear in etiology, with a rapid elevation from 2.7 to 7. The patient received Vitamin K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point. The plan is to repeat INR in PM and if it remains elevated, hold coumadin and give PO vitamin K. If the patient develops active bleeding, IV vitamin K will be given.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was rate-controlled with metoprolol and was discharged in NSR. The patient is already anticoagulated with supratherapeutic INR on warfarin. The plan is to hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension and holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR.

The patient has renal failure, likely due to AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension. The patient's kidneys have started to recover, but the patient remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin. The plan is to monitor UOP and BUN/Cr.

The patient has anemia, with HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. The patient has a history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and psoas bleed found on CT. Coumadin was restarted prior to discharge and heparin was discontinued. The plan is to continue to trend and maintain active type and screen, IV access.

The patient has a history of DVT, with a recent BLE U/S showing no DVT. Warfarin was restarted on [**9-5**]. The plan is to hold coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR and monitor coags.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to chronic obstructive and restrictive lung disease.
2. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, and there is a risk of further hypotension due to hypovolemia or infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding from trach site and psoas bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to elevated INR.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, and there is a risk of further bleeding due to low platelet count.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of further arrhythmias due to supratherapeutic INR.
7. Constipation: The patient has constipation, and there is a risk of further complications due to inadequate bowel care.
8. Funguria: The patient has funguria, and there is a risk of further fungal infections due to inadequate treatment.
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and there is a risk of further complications due to inadequate treatment.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, constipation, funguria, and anemia. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF. He is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient's condition has improved significantly after repositioning of trach with bronchoscopy, and his ABG and patient comfort have markedly improved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is prone to acute decompensation due to obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, and VAP. Close monitoring of ABG and patient comfort is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hct Drop: The patient's Hct is trending down, likely due to a known RP hematoma in the setting of elevated INR. Transfusion of 1 U PRBC and close monitoring of Hct are necessary to prevent further decline.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved with IVF, but close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further episodes.
4. Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient is being treated with tobramycin, and close monitoring of VAP symptoms and laboratory results is necessary to ensure effective treatment.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's INR has resolved after Vitamin K, but close monitoring of INR levels is necessary to prevent further elevation.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is stable, but close monitoring of UOP and BUN/Cr is necessary to prevent nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
7. Constipation: The patient is at risk of constipation, and close monitoring of bowel movements and stool consistency is necessary to prevent complications.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and close monitoring of heart rhythm and rate is necessary to prevent further episodes.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Nutrition: Continue NovaSource Renal at 40 mL/hour, with regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
2. Lines: Maintain PICC line, multi-lumen line, and arterial line.
3. Prophylaxis: Continue DVT prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation (Coumadin) and stress ulcer prophylaxis with IV H2 blocker.
4. Communication: The patient's brother is his HCP, and regular updates are necessary to ensure informed decision-making.
5. Disposition: The patient will be discharged to rehab once the trach issue is resolved."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF. The patient has been readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, with ABG showing pH 7.25, pCO2 69 mmHg, and pO2 98%. The patient is on ventilator support with a tidal volume of 520 mL, respiratory rate of 28, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has hypotension, with a blood pressure of 91/49 mmHg. The patient's heart rate is 81 beats per minute, and the patient has a sinus rhythm.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 45 mg/dL. The patient's hemoglobin level is 25.7 g/dL, and the patient has a platelet count of 112 x 10^9/L.
* Coagulation: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.2, which is likely due to the patient's history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and DVT.
* Infection: The patient has VAP, with a sputum Gram stain showing Gram-negative rods. The patient has been treated with tobramycin, and the patient's antibiotic regimen will be continued.
* Other: The patient has constipation, which will be managed with a home bowel regimen. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was rate-controlled with metoprolol during the patient's previous admission. The patient is currently anticoagulated with warfarin, and the patient's INR will be monitored.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if the patient's ventilator support is discontinued or if the patient's respiratory rate increases.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if the patient's creatinine level increases or if the patient's blood urea nitrogen level increases.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR may worsen if the patient's warfarin therapy is not monitored closely.
* Infection: The patient's VAP may worsen if the patient's antibiotic regimen is not effective or if the patient's sputum culture shows resistant bacteria.
* Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if the patient's bowel regimen is not effective or if the patient's hydration status worsens.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if the patient's heart rate increases or if the patient's anticoagulation therapy is not effective.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue ventilator support to manage the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Continue tobramycin therapy to manage the patient's VAP.
* Monitor the patient's INR closely to ensure that the patient's warfarin therapy is effective.
* Manage the patient's constipation with a home bowel regimen.
* Monitor the patient's renal function closely to ensure that the patient's acute kidney injury does not worsen.
* Monitor the patient's coagulation status closely to ensure that the patient's elevated INR does not worsen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   - Consult ID about low vanc peak, what dosage they would recommend,
   duration of treatment
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   .
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate
   - Restarted coumadin
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently readmitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, DVT, and chronic renal failure. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved ABG and patient comfort after repositioning of the tracheostomy tube and bronchoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive and restrictive lung disease may lead to further respiratory decompensation, requiring close monitoring and potential interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be a sign of underlying cardiovascular instability, which may require further evaluation and treatment, such as vasopressors or inotropes.
3. Elevated INR: The patient's INR may be elevated due to the interaction between fluconazole and warfarin, which may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Close monitoring of the INR and bleeding risk is essential.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to the use of nephrotoxic medications such as tobramycin, requiring close monitoring of renal function and potential adjustments to treatment.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or bleeding, requiring close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and potential transfusions.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's VAP may worsen or spread to other areas of the lung, requiring close monitoring and potential antibiotics.
8. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to pressure ulcers or other factors, requiring close monitoring and potential interventions such as wound care or skin protection.
9. Pain Control: The patient's chronic pain may require close monitoring and potential treatment with analgesics or other pain management strategies.
10. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to his underlying medical conditions and treatment, requiring close monitoring and potential supplementation with nutritional support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra.
   - Pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - PO vit K 10mg
   - maintain IV access
   - CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 5 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   .
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture

   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute kidney injury (AKI). He was readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, and his respiratory status has improved significantly after repositioning of the tracheostomy tube with bronchoscopy. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 66 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 69 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 100/51 mmHg, and his heart rate is 75 beats per minute. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on warfarin with an elevated INR.
* Hematological: The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is 7.8 g/dL, and his hematocrit (Hct) level is 24.9%. He has a history of anemia, and his Hct level is trending down.
* Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is currently on tobramycin therapy. His creatinine (Cr) level is 2.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 30 mmol/L.
* Infectious: The patient has VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and he is being treated with tobramycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if his ventilator settings are not adjusted properly, or if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and elevated INR increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
* Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and low Hct level increase his risk of bleeding or other hematological complications.
* Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and AKI increase his risk of renal failure or other kidney-related complications.
* Infectious complications: The patient's VAP increases his risk of developing other infections, such as sepsis or meningitis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and adjust settings as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his ventilator settings accordingly.
* Continue tobramycin therapy for VAP and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjust his warfarin therapy as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's hematological status closely and consider transfusions if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's renal status closely and adjust his tobramycin therapy as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's infectious status closely and adjust his antibiotic therapy as necessary.
* Consider a podiatry consult to address the patient's nail issues.
* Continue to monitor the patient's pain control and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and address any issues that arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - if hct dropping, consider IV vit K
   - maintain IV access
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - Starting D5W with K at 150ml/hour
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   - Check PM coags
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   - d/c anticoag due to bleed
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, who was readmitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient has a persistent right retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which is causing a decrease in hemoglobin levels. The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, and elevated INR. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. The patient has chronic renal failure and is at risk of nephrotoxicity from tobramycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding from the right retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which could lead to further hemodynamic instability and decreased oxygenation.
2. Progressive respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Nephrotoxicity from tobramycin, which could worsen the patient's chronic renal failure.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and the ongoing hemorrhage.
5. Potential for further development of atrial fibrillation, which could lead to further cardiac instability.
6. Risk of sepsis from the resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP.
7. Potential for further deterioration in skin integrity due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility.
8. Risk of further hypotension and decreased cardiac output due to the patient's ongoing hemorrhage and anticoagulation therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further bleeding and improve oxygenation.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed to prevent nephrotoxicity from tobramycin.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anticoagulation therapy and adjust as needed to prevent further bleeding.
5. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to further manage the patient's atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's VAP and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further deterioration.
7. Consider consulting with a wound care specialist to further manage the patient's skin integrity and prevent further deterioration.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust therapy as needed to prevent further hyperglycemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - Given IV vitK for elevated INR
   - maintain IV access
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - Starting D5W with K at 150ml/hour, increase as needed on repete lytes
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
   .
   # Tube feeds:
   - Restart slowly, check residuals
   - CXR
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   - Check PM coags
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   - d/c anticoag due to bleed
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #Pain control- patient with ongoing large requirements of pain meds and
   anxiolytics. Transitioned over to standing methadone with prn dilaudid
   for long term pain control and a prn ativan for anxiety.
   Currently methadone 10mg NG TID and dilaudid 1-2mg IV q4h prn
   -continue to monitor opiate requirement.
   -may increase standing methadone dose if dilaudid required regularly
   for break through pain
   -change ativan to standing dose
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilation.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - maintain on AC w/ ARDSnet Vt
   - continue tobra 3 more days QOD dosing
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 25.2 to 23.4 today.  Most likely
   source is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   1.8.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q12hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - maintain IV access
   -Coumadin stopped
   -SQ heparin @7500 TID for proph instead or coumadin
   - Check PM coags
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - continue D5W with K at 200 ml/hour, increase as needed and replete
   lytes
   -q4hr FSBG
   #L knee pain.  Pain to touch of L knee this AM.  No obvious sign of
   trauma.
   -3 view xray of L knee
   -brace for transport
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
   # Tube feeds: Stopped yesterday for ? aspiration, restarted o/n
   - at goal, cont.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - [**9-12**] urine cx negative fungal cx
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   -coumadin stopped
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   #Trach site, sacral decub wounds.
   -follow wound care recs
   # Nails:
   - podiatry consult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF, now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, and acute decompensation, which has improved significantly after repositioning of the trach with bronchoscopy.
2. Pneumonia, Bacterial, Ventilator Acquired (VAP): The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP and is being treated with tobramycin.
3. Anemia, Acute, Secondary to Blood Loss (Hemorrhage, Bleeding): The patient's Hct is trending down from 25.2 to 23.4, likely due to a known RP hematoma in the setting of elevated INR.
4. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has a 6.5 L free water deficit and is receiving D5W with K at 200 ml/hour.
5. Renal Failure, Chronic (Chronic Renal Failure, CRF, Chronic Kidney Disease): The patient has likely AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension, which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since the patient's kidneys have started to recover.
6. L Knee Pain: The patient has pain to touch of the L knee, which is not obvious sign of trauma.
7. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient's hypotension has resolved with IVF and is off pressors.
8. Funguria: The patient has completed fluconazole x 14 days and has a negative fungal cx.
9. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed intermittent A. fib during his last admission, which was rate-controlled with metoprolol and was discharged in NSR.
10. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has trach site and sacral decub wounds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, and acute decompensation put him at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's VAP and funguria increase the risk of further infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and elevated INR put him at risk for further bleeding.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure and ongoing treatment with tobramycin increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and further renal failure.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of further skin breakdown.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension put him at risk for further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's chronic kidney disease and impaired gut function increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies.

Based on the patient's current conditions and potential complications, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and treatment, including:

1. Respiratory support: The patient should continue to receive respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Antibiotic therapy: The patient should continue to receive antibiotic therapy for his VAP and funguria.
3. Blood transfusions: The patient should receive blood transfusions as needed to manage his anemia.
4. Renal replacement therapy: The patient should continue to receive renal replacement therapy, including hemodialysis, as needed to manage his chronic renal failure.
5. Wound care: The patient should receive wound care, including debridement and dressing changes, to manage his trach site and sacral decub wounds.
6. Cardiovascular monitoring: The patient should receive close cardiovascular monitoring, including ECG and blood pressure monitoring, to detect any changes in his cardiovascular status.
7. Nutritional support: The patient should receive nutritional support, including enteral nutrition and vitamin supplements, to manage his chronic kidney disease and impaired gut function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #patient continued to require boluses of fentanyl.  Methadone increased
   to 10mg TID and dilaudid ordered to replace fentanyl boluses.  Ativan
   as prn anxiolytic.
   -follow dilaudid  requirement, increase methadone if regularly
   requiring dilaudid
   -continue ativan anxiolytic
L KNEE PAIN
   #New left knee pain noted today.  Pain with palpation, no obvious
   temperature difference, erythema or swelling.  Possible
   fracture/ligamentous injury vs gout vs septic arthritis vs DVT.  Pain
   in the region of previous DVT.
   - LENIs to eval for DVT
   - If LENIs negative tap knee for fluid analysis
   - if gout give steroids
   - if inf start abx
   - if all studies negative, order brace for patient transport for
   comfort
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   # Hct drop:  Hct from 25.2 to 23.4 today.   Was on coumadin for
   paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before
   likely from fluconazole/warfarin interaction.  Now resolved after
   Vitamin K. Most likely source is known RP hematoma in setting of
   elevated INR.  INR currently improved at 1.8.
   - trend Hct Q12hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin, started SC Heparin
   - maintain IV access
   - Check PM coags
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit yesterday.  Received D5W and
   repleted K as needed.
   - Continue  D5W 200ml/hour, repete lytes as needed
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
ALTERED NUTRITION
   # Tube feeds: Restarted yseterday after TF coming out from around trach
   site.
   - Back at goals
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He was readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Left knee pain: The patient has developed new left knee pain, which could be due to fracture, ligamentous injury, gout, septic arthritis, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely due to his underlying lung disease and obesity hypoventilation. He may require further treatment, such as pressure support and bronchodilators.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which is being treated with tobramycin. He may require further antibiotic therapy and monitoring.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which is likely due to his previous hematoma and elevated INR. He will require close monitoring and transfusions as needed.
5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which is likely due to his underlying kidney disease and medication toxicity. He will require close monitoring of his kidney function and electrolyte levels.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W and potassium supplementation. He will require close monitoring of his electrolyte levels and glucose levels.
7. Altered nutrition: The patient has altered nutrition due to his underlying disease and treatment. He will require close monitoring of his nutritional status and potential adjustments to his diet.
8. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which has resolved with IV fluids. He will require close monitoring of his blood pressure and potential adjustments to his medication.
9. Fungal UTI: The patient has completed fluconazole therapy for fungal UTI and will require follow-up urine cultures.
10. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has tach and sacral decub ulcerations, which will require close monitoring and wound care.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment for his multiple medical complications."

   paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before
   likely from fluconazole/warfarin interaction.  Now resolved after
   Vitamin K. Most likely source is known RP hematoma in setting of
   elevated INR.  INR currently improved at 1.8.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #patient continued to require boluses of fentanyl.  Methadone increased
   to 10mg TID and dilaudid ordered to replace fentanyl boluses.  Ativan
   as prn anxiolytic.
   -follow dilaudid  requirement, increase methadone if regularly
   requiring dilaudid
   -continue ativan anxiolytic
L KNEE PAIN
   #New left knee pain noted today.  Pain with palpation, no obvious
   temperature difference, erythema or swelling.  Possible
   fracture/ligamentous injury vs gout vs septic arthritis vs DVT.  Pain
   in the region of previous DVT.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. **Knee joint infection**: The patient has a joint effusion with blood-tinged fluid, and the gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis are pending. The patient may be at risk of developing a joint infection, which can lead to septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or sepsis.
2. **Pulmonary pseudomonas VAP**: The patient has a resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death if not properly managed.
3. **Anemia**: The patient has a significant drop in hemoglobin levels, which can lead to anemia, fatigue, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. **Renal failure**: The patient has chronic renal failure, and the recent increase in tobramycin dose may further compromise renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
5. **Hypernatremia**: The patient has hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and seizures if not properly managed.
6. **Impaired skin integrity**: The patient has tach and sacral decub ulcerations, which can lead to infection, sepsis, and prolonged hospitalization if not properly managed.
7. **Fungal UTI**: The patient had a fungal UTI, which can lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and prolonged hospitalization if not properly managed.
8. **Hypotension**: The patient has hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction, sepsis, and death if not properly managed.
9. **Respiratory failure**: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest, sepsis, and death if not properly managed.

The patient's medical conditions and complications require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration."
