   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .
   Access: Rt PICC placed [**1-1**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and complications including MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter UTI. He was transferred to the ICU due to melanotic stools and a drop in hemoglobin from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight. He was resuscitated with 3 units of packed red blood cells and is currently stable with a hemoglobin level of 32.2. He has been treated empirically with ganciclovir and vancomycin for colitis and C. diff infection. He is also being treated for MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin.

The patient has ongoing complications, including:

* GI bleed: He has passed melanotic stool again this morning and is being treated with oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir.
* Urinary tract infection: He has a positive urine culture for enterobacter and is being treated with ciprofloxacin.
* MRSA bacteremia: He has been treated with vancomycin and is awaiting a TEE to determine the length of treatment.
* RUE swelling: He has a right cephalic vein clot and may need to switch his PICC line to the left arm.
* Abdominal pain and diarrhea: He has colitis with ulcerations and is being treated with ganciclovir and oral vancomycin.
* Celiac disease: He has severe, refractory celiac disease and is on TPN with a gluten-free diet.
* Atrial fibrillation: He is in and out of RVR when anxious or moving and is being treated with diltiazem for rate control.
* Hypertension: He is being treated with medications to control his blood pressure.
* Hypothyroidism: He is being treated with synthroid.
* Osteoporosis: He is being treated with D2 and citracal.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Continued GI bleeding and anemia
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Progression of MRSA bacteremia or development of endocarditis
* Complications from the urinary tract infection, such as kidney damage or sepsis
* Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to the RUE swelling
* Complications from the colitis, such as perforation or abscess formation
* Development of hypothyroidism or osteoporosis-related complications
* Atrial fibrillation-related complications, such as stroke or heart failure
* Hypertension-related complications, such as heart failure or kidney damage."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-inch tall individual with a weight not specified. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, and other unknown origin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2°C (100.7°F), pulse rate 105-130 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 inspirations per minute (ins/min), and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient has a history of allergies to gluten, Augmentin, and an unknown substance that causes diarrhea. The patient has received various medications, including ganciclovir, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and anxious individual with normocephalic head, normal cardiovascular examination, symmetric chest expansion, and clear breath sounds. The patient has diminished radial and digital pulses on both sides, as well as edema on the left lower leg. The patient's abdomen is distended, and bowel sounds are hypoactive.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and hematocrit of 21.3%. The patient's platelet count is 414 K/uL, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 26 mg/dL. The patient's serum creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL, and the glucose level is 236 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's plan includes resuscitation with a goal of hematocrit >30%, serial hemocrit every 6 hours, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient will also receive a tagged red blood cell scan if bleeding recurs. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock due to continued bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, which may lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Sepsis and septic shock due to underlying infections.
5. Kidney injury or failure due to hypovolemia and hypotension.
6. Hepatic dysfunction due to prolonged hypotension and hypoperfusion.
7. Neurological complications, including seizures, due to hypoxia and hypoperfusion.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent these complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt
   [**Name (NI) **] noted to have evolution of guaiac positive stools through day
   yesterday with stable PM HCT of 31.1 and subsequent melena overnight
   with passage of clots this morning and AM HCT of 21.4. Has known
   colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated empirically
   with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated for c. diff
   with oral vancomycin. Though he known causes for a lower GI bleed, the
   presence of melena is more suggestive.
   - Attempt to place additional IV access to assist in resuscitation
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse two units PRBC
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Bleeding scan to help localize location of bleeding
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt
   [**Name (NI) **] noted to have evolution of guaiac positive stools through day
   yesterday with stable PM HCT of 31.1 and subsequent melena overnight
   with passage of clots this morning and AM HCT of 21.4. Has known
   colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated empirically
   with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated for c. diff
   with oral vancomycin. Though he known causes for a lower GI bleed, the
   presence of melena is more suggestive.
   - Attempt to place additional IV access to assist in resuscitation
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse two units PRBC
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Bleeding scan to help localize location of bleeding
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple complications, including MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter UTI. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of GI bleed, and his condition has been complicated by melena, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 105-130 bpm
* Blood pressure: 140/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Thin and anxious appearance
* Normal cardiac examination
* Diminished peripheral pulses
* Distended and hypoactive bowel sounds
* Erythema on the left lower leg
* Muscle wasting
* Warm skin
* Attentive and follows simple commands

Laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 21.3%, 28.9%, 30.6%, and 29.6%
* White blood cell count: 16.7 and 16.2
* Platelet count: 358 and 414
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's melena and tachycardia suggest ongoing bleeding, which may require further resuscitation and transfusion.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is persistently high, and he is at risk for embolic complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he may require further antihypertensive therapy.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's synthroid medication may need to be adjusted to prevent hypothyroidism.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may require further management to prevent fractures.
6. Celiac disease: The patient's severe, refractory celiac disease may require further management to prevent complications.
7. MRSA bacteremia: The patient's MRSA bacteremia may require further antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrence.
8. Enterobacter UTI: The patient's enterobacter UTI may require further antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrence.
9. Colitis: The patient's colitis may require further management to prevent complications.
10. C. difficile: The patient's C. difficile infection may require further management to prevent recurrence.

The patient's plan includes:

1. GI bleed: Attempt to place additional IV access to assist in resuscitation, transfuse two units PRBC, and pantoprazole 40 mg IV q12h.
2. Atrial fibrillation: Continue monitoring and consider rate control with diltiazem.
3. Hypertension: Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss.

   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Hct increased from 21.3 to 30.6 then 29.6
   - Went for bleeding scan which was negative per IR
   - GI saw patient and recommended flex sig if he starts bleeding again,
   tranfuse for Hct<30, conservative management for now
   - ID following, rec continuing po vanc, IV Cipro, IV vanc.  Continue
   ganciclovir until [**12-22**] GI tissue cx negative.  Also wanted PA and
   lateral CXR and sputum cx.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, will consider flex sig
   if bleeds again.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Vitamin K 5 mg PO x 1
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h?
   - Consider IR consultation following bleeding scan if source identified
   and amenable to embolization
   - Surgery consultation
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE, which
   had tentatively been scheduled for Monday, [**2164-1-2**].
   - TEE today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   - Monitor vanc levels with vanc trough on morning of [**2164-1-3**]
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - Appreciate gastroenterology input
   - Appreciate ID consultation
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   - Repeat stool studies including c. diff
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Currently in NSR per telemetry. Typically rate control with metoprolol
   100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple comorbidities, including MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter UTI. The patient has been in the ICU for the past 24 hours, during which time he has experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 31.1 to 21.4, necessitating transfusion with 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.7°F)
* Heart rate: 105-130 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 140/56 mmHg (SBP 120-130 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AFib)

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* General appearance: Thin, anxious
* Cardiovascular: Diminished peripheral pulses, including right radial, left radial, right dorsal pedis, and left dorsal pedis pulses
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds, symmetric expansion
* Abdominal: Distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, non-tender, no rebound or guarding
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: Absent, left lower extremity edema: Absent, area of erythema on left lower leg
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person and place, but not time

Laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin (Hct): 32.2%
* White blood cell count (WBC): 16.7 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count (Plt): 414 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Normal
* Liver enzymes: Elevated (ALT, AST)
* Coagulation studies: Normal (PT, PTT, INR)

The patient's current medications include:

* Ganciclovir IV
* Vancomycin IV
* Ciprofloxacin IV
* Pantoprazole IV
* Morphine sulfate IV
* Vitamin K PO
* Synthroid PO
* TPN with lipids
* D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding and hemodynamic instability
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of endocarditis due to history of endocarditis and ongoing bacteremia
* Complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as stroke or systemic embolism
* Ongoing colitis and diarrhea, potentially leading to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances
* Development of celiac disease-related complications, such as malnutrition, osteoporosis, or increased risk of infections

Based on the patient's current condition and comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen to prevent and manage potential complications."

   85 yo male with history of celiac disease and now with recent findings

   transfer to ICU for further care.  We did pursue obtaining adequate IV
   access and then tagged RBC scan which failed to show source of bleeding
   and this in the setting of stabilization of HCT does suggest that acute
   and brisk bleeding has stopped but given production of maroon stool
   this morning ongoing bleeding is of concern.  This is, of course,
   clinical improvement in stability but does make identification of
   source of bleeding more challenging at this time.  With GI, IR and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of celiac disease who presented with a GI bleed and was transferred to the ICU for further care. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 128/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's imaging studies, including a bleeding scan and CXR, did not show any evidence of bleeding or pulmonary infiltrates.

The patient's current medications include antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and UTI, as well as proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is receiving TPN for nutrition and has a PICC line in place for IV access.

The patient's plan includes continued monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results, as well as endoscopy this afternoon to further evaluate the source of bleeding. The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for his bacteremia and UTI, and will be monitored for any signs of sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bleeding: The patient's GI bleed has stopped, but there is still a risk of bleeding due to the patient's underlying condition and the use of anticoagulant medications.
2. Infection: The patient has a MRSA bacteremia and UTI, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which can lead to jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition can lead to weight loss, weakness, and decreased immune function.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer can lead to bleeding and perforation of the stomach or small intestine.
8. VAP: The patient's VAP can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32 this AM.  Cdiff negative.  Pt
   has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. GI following.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct Q12H
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - d/c PO Vanc
   #. Urinary tract infection: Urinalysis and culture was drawn on
   [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising
   leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision
   hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on
   [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**], now on day 4)
   #. MRSA bacteremia: PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood
   cultures since admission have been without growth. PICC tip was sent
   for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth. TTE on
   [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not
   rule out small vegetations. Patient has a past history of endocarditis
   in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID
   consult recommending TEE.
   - TEE likely today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**] , now on
   day 16/indeterminant course)
   #. RUE swelling: Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
    #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with
   ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has returned negative for CMV, viral
   culture no growth to date. CMV viral load negative. Despite this will
   continue to treat for CMV with ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the
   ICU, patient had received a few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic
   dilation as a hearld for worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative
   for concerning changes. C. diff has been negative for 6 separate
   measures (last on [**2164-1-2**]).
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue IV ganciclovir, d/c PO Vanc. Ideally will switch to PO
   ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:  Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking
   gluten free medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - consider restarting metoprolol
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - consider restart Metoprolol with holding parameters, hold femlodipine
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and complications including MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter UTI. He was transferred to the ICU for melanotic stools with a Hct drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight. He has ongoing GI bleed, urinary tract infection, and MRSA bacteremia. He also has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has ongoing GI bleed, which can lead to further bleeding, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can lead to sepsis, kidney damage, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. MRSA Bacteremia: The patient has MRSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, endocarditis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to stroke, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can lead to stroke, heart failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which can lead to fatigue, weight gain, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures, particularly in the spine, hips, and wrists, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Celiac Disease: The patient has severe, refractory celiac disease, which can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. Colitis: The patient has colitis, which can lead to further complications such as perforation, abscesses, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN
   .
   PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, no anticoagulation given GI bleed
   .
   Access: Rt PICC placed [**1-1**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32.2 this AM.  Passed melanotic
   stool again this morning, sent for c diff and stool culture.  Pt has
   known colitis with mucosal ulcerations which is being treated
   empirically with ganciclovir. Additionally, being empirically treated
   for c. diff with oral vancomycin. GI following, plan for  flex sig this
   afternoon given continued melanotic stooling, although brisk bleeding
   seems to have stopped at pressent.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole 40 mg IV Q12H
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct q8h
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   #. Urinary tract infection:
   Urinalysis and culture was drawn on [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low
   grade temperatures and a rising leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was
   unimpressive, treatment decision hinged on a urine culture that was
   positive for enterobacter on [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started
   at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**])
   #. MRSA bacteremia:
   PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood cultures since admission
   have been without growth. PICC tip was sent for culture on [**2163-12-19**]
   and has final result of no growth. TTE on [**2163-12-20**] was negative for
   valvular vegetations; however, could not rule out small vegetations.
   Patient has a past history of endocarditis in [**2162**], which increases his
   risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID consult recommending TEE.  Vanc
   trough today appropriate.
   - TEE likely tomorrow to determine length of treatment.
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**])
   #. RUE swelling:
   Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
   #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis:
   Flexible sigmoidoscopy with ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has
   returned negative for CMV, viral culture no growth to date. CMV viral
   load negative. Despite this will continue to treat for CMV with
   ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient had received a
   few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic dilation as a hearld for
   worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative for concerning changes. C.
   diff has been negative for 4 separate measures (last on [**2163-12-20**]).
   - f/u repeat C diff toxins
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue oral vancomycin and IV ganciclovir. Ideally will switch to
   PO ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:
   Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking gluten free
   medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - Hold metoprolol while in period of acute blood loss
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   - continue diltiazem 30 mg qid for rate control
   #. Hypertension:
   - Hold metoprolol and felodipine while in period of acute blood loss
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D
   # FEN: NPO, on TPN

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU with melanotic stools, hematochezia, and a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 31.1 to 21.4. He has been treated for MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and a history of endocarditis.

The patient's current medications include ganciclovir IV for empiric treatment of CMV colitis, oral vancomycin for suspected Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, and pantoprazole IV for stress ulcer prophylaxis. He is also receiving TPN for nutritional support.

The patient's laboratory results show a drop in Hct from 32.9 to 30.0 over the past 24 hours, with a current Hct of 32.0%. His white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 16.7, and his platelet count is stable at 445 K/uL. His blood cultures are pending, and his sputum culture is inadequate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's ongoing GI bleeding is a significant concern, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
2. C. diff infection: The patient's C. diff infection is not yet fully treated, and a recurrence could lead to further complications, including diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. MRSA bacteremia: The patient's MRSA bacteremia is not yet fully treated, and a recurrence could lead to further complications, including endocarditis, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.
4. UTI: The patient's UTI is not yet fully treated, and a recurrence could lead to further complications, including sepsis, kidney damage, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not yet fully controlled, and further arrhythmias could lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of stroke.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not yet fully controlled, and further elevations in blood pressure could lead to end-organ damage, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and retinopathy.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is not yet fully treated, and further hypothyroidism could lead to fatigue, cold intolerance, dry skin, and decreased cognitive function.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis is not yet fully treated, and further fractures could lead to decreased mobility, pain, and increased risk of complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   85 yo male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged
   hospitalization following presentation with diarrhea and [**Last Name (un) 2406**] on
   [**2163-12-17**]. Course complicated by MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown
   etiology, enterobacter UTI.  Transferred to ICU for melanotic stools
   with  HCT drop from 31.1 to 21.4 overnight on [**12-31**].
   #. GI bleed: Pt  with melanotic GI bleed and Hct drop, resuscitated
   with 3 U PRBCs and Hct now stable at 32 this AM.  Had brown stool
   today.  Cdiff negative.  Pt has known colitis with mucosal ulcerations
   which is being treated empirically with ganciclovir. GI following.
   - Active type and screen
   - Pantoprazole at home dose, PO
   - Appreciate ongoing GI consultation input
   - Continue to monitor Hct Q12H
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - d/c PO Vanc
   #. Urinary tract infection: Urinalysis and culture was drawn on
   [**2163-12-29**] due to concern for low grade temperatures and a rising
   leukocytosis at that time. As U/A was unimpressive, treatment decision
   hinged on a urine culture that was positive for enterobacter on
   [**2163-12-31**]. Ciprofloxacin IV was started at that time.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days total (Day 1 = [**12-31**], now on day 4)
   #. MRSA bacteremia: PICC removed on [**12-19**] and surveillance blood
   cultures since admission have been without growth. PICC tip was sent
   for culture on [**2163-12-19**] and has final result of no growth. TTE on
   [**2163-12-20**] was negative for valvular vegetations; however, could not
   rule out small vegetations. Patient has a past history of endocarditis
   in [**2162**], which increases his risk for recurrent endocarditis and ID
   consult recommending TEE.
   - TEE likely today
   - Continue Vancomycin 750 mg IV q24h (day 1 vanco = [**2163-12-19**] , now on
   day 16/indeterminant course), hold tomorrow mornings dose and check a
   level given elevated level this AM
   #. RUE swelling: Likely due to right cephalic vein clot in RUE.
   - Ideally will need to eventually switch PICC line to left arm, likely
   on Wednesday as PICC is functional and patient to undergo several
   procedures prior to PICC replacement.
   - No anticoagulation indicated at this time for a superficial vein
   clot, especially in time of GI bleed
    #. Abdominal pain / Diarrhea / Colitis: Flexible sigmoidoscopy with
   ulcerations, colitis. Pathology has returned negative for CMV, viral
   culture no growth to date. CMV viral load negative. Despite this will
   continue to treat for CMV with ganciclovir IV. Prior to transfer to the
   ICU, patient had received a few days of serial KUBs to monitor colonic
   dilation as a hearld for worsening colitis. These KUBs were negative
   for concerning changes. C. diff has been negative for 6 separate
   measures (last on [**2164-1-2**]).
   - Appreciate ID consultation, will continue to f/u recs regarding need
   for ganciclovir
   - Continue IV ganciclovir, d/c PO Vanc. Ideally will switch to PO
   ganciclovir, though this has been halted by patient complaint of
   abdominal pain.
   #. Celiac disease:  Severe, refractory, on TPN. Patient only taking
   gluten free medications. Ordered for gluten free clear liquid diet.
   - Patient's family will bring in all foods and most medications to
   assure they are gluten free
   - Continue cycled TPN
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt in and out of RVR when anxious or moving
   from chair to bed.  Typically rate controlled with metoprolol 100 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Not on systemic anticoagulation.
   - restart metoprolol and d/c diltiazem (on home metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **])
   - Hold aspirin at this time
   #. Hypertension:
   - restart Metoprolol with holding parameters, hold femlodipine
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - Continue synthroid.
   #. Osteoporosis:
   - Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of refractory celiac disease, prolonged hospitalization, and multiple comorbidities. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleed, fever of unknown origin, and other complications.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) level: 32.9 g/dL (stable)
* Platelet count (Plt): 445 K/uL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 16.7 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 109 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL

The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, colitis of unknown etiology, and enterobacter urinary tract infection (UTI). He is currently receiving treatment for CMV colitis with ganciclovir IV.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed)
* Fever of unknown origin (FUO)
* MRSA bacteremia
* Urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Celiac disease
* Atrial fibrillation
* Hypertension
* Hypothyroidism
* Osteoporosis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue IV ganciclovir for CMV colitis
* Hold PO Vanc and restart if C diff's sent today are negative
* Repeat urine culture
* Tagged RBC scan if bleeds
* TEE on [**1-3**]
* Tunnelled line on [**1-4**] for TPN
* Continue ciprofloxacin for 7 days
* Hold tomorrow's dose of Vancomycin and check a level due to elevated level
* Consider switching PICC line to left arm on Wednesday
* Continue IV ganciclovir and d/c PO Vanc
* Restart metoprolol and d/c diltiazem
* Hold aspirin at this time
* Continue synthroid
* Continue home D2 50,000 units on Mon/Thurs, citracal + D

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* GI bleed worsening
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immunocompromised state
* Endocarditis due to history of endocarditis and ongoing bacteremia
* Osteoporosis-related fractures
* Hypothyroidism-related complications
* Hypertension-related complications
* Atrial fibrillation-related complications
* Celiac disease-related complications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with significant celiac disease and ulcerating lesions noted
   in the colon we have patient admitted with GI bleed concerning for
   lower source.  Importantly bleeding appears to have slowed
   substantially and we have seen an increasing difficulty in capacity to
   identify source.  We have coordinated plan with GI and surgery and IR
   and will currently continue to monitor HCT and consider flexible
   sigmoidostomy vs. bleeding scan for any recurrent evidence of bleeing.
   We will have to consider treatment for CMV as reasonable across time
   given concern for contribution to ulcerating lesions.
   1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)-
   -Flex sig deferred with stable HCT
   -GCV to be continued x 21 days
   -HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -Monitor BM's for evidence of blood.
   -PPI to continue
   -With stability will have to consider transfer to floor following TEE
   today
   2)UTI-

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with significant celiac disease and ulcerating lesions noted
   in the colon we have patient admitted with GI bleed concerning for
   lower source.  Importantly bleeding appears to have slowed
   substantially and we have seen an increasing difficulty in capacity to
   identify source.  We have coordinated plan with GI and surgery and IR
   and will currently continue to monitor HCT and consider flexible
   sigmoidostomy vs. bleeding scan for any recurrent evidence of bleeing.
   We will have to consider treatment for CMV as reasonable across time
   given concern for contribution to ulcerating lesions.

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, concerning for a lower GI source. The bleeding has slowed significantly, but the source remains unclear. The patient has a history of celiac disease and ulcerating lesions in the colon. The patient is currently being treated with pantoprazole, gancyclovir, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with no signs of altered mental status or focal deficits.

Potential medical complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may continue to worsen if the source is not identified and treated promptly.
2. Celiac disease: The patient's celiac disease may exacerbate the GI bleed and lead to malabsorption of nutrients.
3. Ulcerating lesions: The patient's ulcerating lesions in the colon may continue to cause bleeding and lead to complications such as perforation or abscess formation.
4. MRSA bacteremia: The patient's MRSA bacteremia may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
5. UTI: The patient's UTI may lead to sepsis and kidney damage if not treated promptly.
6. DVT: The patient's DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism and death if not treated promptly.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer may lead to bleeding and perforation if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's GI bleed with pantoprazole and gancyclovir.
3. Consider flexible sigmoidoscopy or bleeding scan to identify the source of the GI bleed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin.
5. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with ciprofloxacin.
6. Consider prophylaxis for DVT with heparin or warfarin.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with a histamine-2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor."
