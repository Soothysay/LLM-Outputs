   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treating for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, mitral regurgitation, and moderate aortic stenosis, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fluid overload, and NSTEMI. She has been treated with IV fluids, morphine, and lasix, and has shown improvement in her respiratory status. She has also been given antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she is at risk for further respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema and cardiac ischemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, and she is at risk for overdiuresis or cardiogenic shock.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to sinus tachycardia, but it may also be a sign of underlying infection or cardiac ischemia.
4. Confusion/Weakness: The patient's mental status is clear, but she may be at risk for further deterioration due to underlying infection or electrolyte imbalance.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be a sign of underlying infection or C-diff colonization.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she may be at risk for further imbalance due to ongoing fluid and electrolyte losses.
7. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's NSTEMI is still active, and she is at risk for further cardiac ischemia and infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to optimize her cardiac function with medication and fluid management.
3. Monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust her treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to treat her underlying infection with antibiotics.
5. Consider further evaluation of her mental status and electrolyte imbalance once she is stabilized.
6. Monitor her cardiac function and adjust her treatment accordingly.
7. Consider further evaluation of her diarrhea and potential C-diff colonization."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old woman, is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) and fluid overload. She has a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. The patient is receiving treatment for possible pneumonia, as she has symptoms of cough and secretions prior to admission. She is also being treated for NSTEMI with ASA, and her troponin levels are trending down.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory status is a concern due to her fluid overload and potential pneumonia. She is receiving non-rebreather oxygen therapy and bipap as needed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is at risk for overdiuresis or cardiogenic shock. Gentle fluid boluses are being administered to avoid pulmonary edema, and dobutamine may be considered if not responsive to fluid.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to her respiratory distress and underlying cardiac conditions. Her tachycardia is being treated with diuresis and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
4. Confusion/Weakness: The patient is alert and mentating well, but she is at risk for further decline due to her underlying infection and potential spinal stenosis. She will require further evaluation once stable.
5. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, and stool studies are being performed to rule out C. difficile infection.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient is at risk for further fluid overload due to her ongoing treatment for NSTEMI and potential pneumonia. Her fluid balance is being closely monitored to avoid pulmonary edema.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to her underlying conditions and potential pneumonia. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine legionella tests pending.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications."

   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treated for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fluid overload, and a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxia, tachypnea, hypotension, tachycardia, confusion, weakness, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 140/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a central venous catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac injury, as well as abnormal kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical plan includes the administration of antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants, as well as the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to manage her respiratory distress. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is to be transferred to the floor for further care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal complications: The patient's abnormal kidney function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia may worsen, leading to sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or other gastrointestinal complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her medical plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 7337**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of
   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treating for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.
   Received lasix and morphine [**5-1**]  with improvement in respiratory
   status. Echo shows EF 70%, LVH, mod AS, mild MR (but likely worsen,
   given shadows)
   - nebulizers
   - Continue levaquin
   - cultures negative to date
   .
   #) Hypotension: Concern for overdiuresis vs cardiogenic shock in
   setting of NSTEMI. Also would consider infectious etiology given cough
   at presentation and low grade fevers, however less likely. Given 250 cc
   bolus x 2 for SBPs in 70s with improvement in BP to 80/90s [**5-2**] and
   increase in urine output. Overnight SBPs improved 100s-130s and good
   UOP.
   - gentle fluid boluses as needed- will try to avoid pulmonary edema
   .
   #) Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia. Patient is on Diltiazem as
   outpatient. Likely worsened in the setting of respiratory distress.
   Improved with diuresis
   -holding dilt given hypotension
   .
   #) Confusion/weakness: Patient is alert, mentating well with SBPs
   70-80s. Mental status now.
   -treat underlying infection
   -hx of spinal stenosis likely contributing
   .
   # diarrhea: Improved
   -send stool studies, C-diff if diarrhea
   .
   #) F/E/N. No IVF as above. Monitor/replete electrolytes.
   #) Prophylaxis. Heparin

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, mitral regurgitation, and aortic stenosis, was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fluid overload, and suspected NSTEMI. She was treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/63 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild elevation in troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Her renal function is slightly impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Her white blood cell count is mildly elevated, and her platelet count is within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia/tachypnea: likely due to pulmonary edema or cardiac ischemia.
2. Hypotension: possible due to overdiuresis, cardiogenic shock, or infectious etiology.
3. Tachycardia: likely due to sinus tachycardia, worsened by respiratory distress.
4. Confusion/weakness: possibly due to underlying infection, spinal stenosis, or electrolyte imbalance.
5. Diarrhea: improved with treatment, but stool studies and C-diff testing are pending.
6. Fluid overload: managed with diuretics and fluid restriction.
7. Possible pneumonia: treated with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.
8. Possible aspiration pneumonia: treated with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued treatment for possible pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Monitoring and management of fluid overload.
3. Repletion of electrolytes as needed.
4. Continued treatment for NSTEMI.
5. Follow-up with echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.
6. Monitoring for signs of infection or sepsis.
7. Consideration of stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to be transferred to the floor for further care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 7337**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of
   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treated for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.
   Received lasix and morphine [**5-1**]  with improvement in respiratory
   status. Echo shows EF 70%, LVH, mod AS, mild MR (but likely worsen,
   given shadows). Initally received levaquin for ? pneumonia but d/c
   [**5-3**] as no obvious pneumonia on CXR. [**5-3**] received additional dose of
   lasix with 1.1 L urine output, net 620 cc net negative over 24 hours.
   Now sating well on 2 L NC.
   - nebulizers
   - cultures negative to date
   - sputum cx if producing sputum
   .
   #) Hypotension: Concern for overdiuresis vs cardiogenic shock in
   setting of NSTEMI. Also would consider infectious etiology given cough
   at presentation and low grade fevers, however less likely. Given 250 cc
   bolus x 2 for SBPs in 70s with improvement in BP to 80/90s [**5-2**] and
   increase in urine output. [**5-3**] SBPs improved 100s-130s and good UOP.
   Overnight pressures stable.
   - diltiazem being held in setting of hypotension
   .
   #) Confusion/weakness: Patient was alert, mentating well with SBPs
   70-80s on presentation to MICU, although initial admission for ? MS
   changes. Mental status initially improved, became more delirious [**5-3**].
   Given haldol and zydis overnight. Potential etiologies include
   medication induced, environmental, or infectious.
   -levaquin d/c

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fluid overload, and NSTEMI. She has been treated with lasix, morphine, and heparin, and has shown improvement in her respiratory status. However, she continues to experience hypoxia, tachypnea, hypotension, confusion, and diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's increased bibasilar opacities on CXR could indicate pulmonary edema, which may worsen her respiratory status.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction could lead to cardiac ischemia, which may worsen her cardiac function.
3. Infection: The patient's cough, secretions, and low-grade fevers could indicate an infection, which may worsen her condition.
4. Overdiuresis: The patient's hypotension could be due to overdiuresis, which may lead to hypovolemia and worsen her cardiac function.
5. Delirium: The patient's confusion and agitation could be due to medication-induced delirium, environmental factors, or an underlying infection.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea could be due to an underlying infection or medication side effects, which may worsen her electrolyte imbalance.
7. Cardiac Failure: The patient's NSTEMI and diastolic dysfunction could lead to cardiac failure, which may worsen her respiratory and cardiac status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as needed.
4. Consider sending stool studies to rule out an underlying infection.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust her medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status and develop a plan for her care.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a rehabilitation facility for further care and rehabilitation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of increased bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray, possibly representing fluid accumulation. The patient was administered 20mg of Lasix with a 1.1L output. Additionally, the patient is exhibiting signs of delirium and agitation, for which 5mg of Zydis and 0.5mg of Haldol IV were administered.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F) with a current temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F)
* Heart rate: 91 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 71-117 bpm
* Blood pressure: 160/84 mmHg with a range of 101-125 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (insp/min) with a range of 16-24 insp/min
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.1-11.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 35.7-36.6%
* Platelet count: 161-205 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9-1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.25-0.52 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27 mmHg
* Glucose: 69-123 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated lactate, ALT, AST, and LDH levels.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's delirium and agitation, making it difficult to assess peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic status.

The patient has a history of delirium and confusion, impaired balance, gait, and knowledge, and impaired transfers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to the bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray.
2. Fluid overload or congestive heart failure due to the Lasix administration and fluid balance data.
3. Delirium and agitation, which can lead to falls, skin breakdown, and other complications.
4. Impaired respiratory function, which can lead to respiratory failure.
5. Infection or sepsis, which can be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state and medical devices.
6. Hemorrhage or bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
7. Electrolyte imbalances or metabolic disturbances due to the patient's altered lab results.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to the patient's tachycardia and hypertension.
9. Renal insufficiency or failure due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their care plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 7337**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of
   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treated for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.
   Received lasix and morphine [**5-1**]  with improvement in respiratory
   status. Echo shows EF 70%, LVH, mod AS, mild MR (but likely worsen,
   given shadows). Initally received levaquin for ? pneumonia but d/c
   [**5-3**] as no obvious pneumonia on CXR. [**5-3**] received additional dose of
   lasix with 1.1 L urine output, net 620 cc net negative over 24 hours.
   - nebulizers
   - cultures negative to date
   - sputum cx
   .
   #) Hypotension: Concern for overdiuresis vs cardiogenic shock in
   setting of NSTEMI. Also would consider infectious etiology given cough
   at presentation and low grade fevers, however less likely. Given 250 cc
   bolus x 2 for SBPs in 70s with improvement in BP to 80/90s [**5-2**] and
   increase in urine output. [**5-3**] SBPs improved 100s-130s and good UOP.
   Overnight pressures stable.
   - gentle fluid boluses as needed- will try to avoid pulmonary edema
   - diltiazem being held in setting of hypotension
   .
   #) Confusion/weakness: Patient was alert, mentating well with SBPs
   70-80s. Mental status initially improved, became more delirious [**5-3**].
   Given haldol and zydis overnight.
   -levaquin d/c
d [**5-3**] due to concern it was contributing to patient
   confusion
   -continue to monitor for signs of infection
   .
   # diarrhea: Improved
   -send stool studies, C-diff if diarrhea
   .
   #) F/E/N. No IVF as above. Monitor/replete electrolytes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 7337**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of
   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treated for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.
   Received lasix and morphine [**5-1**]  with improvement in respiratory
   status. Echo shows EF 70%, LVH, mod AS, mild MR (but likely worsen,
   given shadows). Initally received levaquin for ? pneumonia but d/c
   [**5-3**] as no obvious pneumonia on CXR. [**5-3**] received additional dose of
   lasix with 1.1 L urine output, net 620 cc net negative over 24 hours.
   - nebulizers
   - cultures negative to date
   - sputum cx
   .
   #) Hypotension: Concern for overdiuresis vs cardiogenic shock in
   setting of NSTEMI. Also would consider infectious etiology given cough
   at presentation and low grade fevers, however less likely. Given 250 cc
   bolus x 2 for SBPs in 70s with improvement in BP to 80/90s [**5-2**] and
   increase in urine output. [**5-3**] SBPs improved 100s-130s and good UOP.
   Overnight pressures stable.
   - gentle fluid boluses as needed- will try to avoid pulmonary edema
   - diltiazem being held in setting of hypotension
   .
   #) Confusion/weakness: Patient was alert, mentating well with SBPs
   70-80s. Mental status initially improved, became more delirious [**5-3**].
   Given haldol and zydis overnight.
   -levaquin d/c
d [**5-3**] due to concern it was contributing to patient
   confusion
   -continue to monitor for signs of infection
   .
   # diarrhea: Improved
   -send stool studies, C-diff if diarrhea

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation, presenting with cough, secretions, and difficulty walking, and was transferred to the ICU after developing respiratory distress with fluid overload. The patient was ruled in for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and has evidence of pulmonary edema, cardiac ischemia, and possible pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 160/84 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the administration of lasix and morphine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac damage, and decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, indicating anemia and thrombocytopenia. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the patient has a slightly elevated lactate level, indicating potential metabolic acidosis.

The patient's medical complications include hypoxia, tachypnea, hypotension, confusion, and diarrhea. The patient's delirium is being treated with haldol and zydis, and the patient's diarrhea has improved with treatment.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's increased bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray and fluid overload may indicate pulmonary edema, which could worsen if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's NSTEMI and cardiac ischemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's cough and secretions on admission, as well as the possibility of aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, may indicate pneumonia, which could worsen if not managed properly.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's elevated lactate level and potential metabolic acidosis may indicate diabetic ketoacidosis, which could worsen if not managed properly.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become imbalanced if not managed properly, leading to complications such as arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's decreased platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, which could worsen if not managed properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Ongoing monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to assess the patient's response to treatment.
2. Management of the patient's respiratory status with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators as needed.
3. Management of the patient's cardiac status with medication and close monitoring.
4. Management of the patient's electrolyte levels with IV fluids and electrolyte supplements as needed.
5. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and increased lactate levels.
6. Continuing treatment for the patient's diarrhea with anti-diarrheal medications and monitoring for signs of dehydration.
7. Continuing treatment for the patient's delirium with haldol and zydis and monitoring for signs of improvement.
8. Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac status with echocardiograms and troponin levels to assess for any changes in cardiac function."
