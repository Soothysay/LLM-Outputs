   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD and do peripheral cultures here as
   were not done in ED prior to transfer to floor
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Will need line pulled likely today.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   - Renal aware patient is here
   - No need for HD currently
   - Continue MWF schedule
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue home medications
   .
   #. PVD: Patient has h/o severe PVD with multiple amputations and
   chronic osteomyelitis in recent past.
   - Appreciate vascular recs
   - Will Rx with abx as above
   - Will continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica.
   Morphine IV for breakthrough pain
   .
   #. HTN: Patient has h/o HTN but p/w borderline hypotension and possible
   septic shock, now normotensive
   - Will cont to hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF: Patient is currently hypovolemic with septic
   physiology.
   - Will hold lasix, diovan, and beta blocker as above
   - Will monitor CVP to ensure do not over-rescusitate given patient does
   not want to be intubated.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Very mild and could be [**2-10**] hypoperfusion in setting
   of transient hypotension in ED.
   - will hold statin
   - trend LFTs
   - consider RUQ U/S if does not resolve with fluids
   .
   #. Erythrocytosis: Hct is extremely high for him given baseline of
   mid-thirties on most recent hospitalization. Suspect hemoconcentration
   from combination of dialysis and sepsis.
   - will hydrate as above
   - will monitor daily hcts
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology given with infection usually get
   reactive thrombocytosis. Could be from nutritional deficiency given
   severe wasting and difficulty eating over last several months.
   - Will monitor plt count daily
   - Transfuse for plt<10K or <50K with evidence of bleeding.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Patient has recently been worked up for long h/o
   dysphagia which is likely [**2-10**] muscle weakness of deconditioning
   accompanied by severe reflux. Is now s/p G-tube placement for better
   nutrition supposed to start TFs today but because was at hospital did
   not get recs from VNA.
   - will have nutrition consult in am
   - NPO except meds for now given severe aspiration risk
   - Aspiration precautions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and a history of sepsis/severe sepsis. He has received 2.5 L of normal saline and maintenance fluids overnight. The patient has a history of gabapentin allergy and has been receiving cefipime antibiotics since admission. He has a history of weight loss over the past 4 months and is currently malnourished. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/47 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient has impaired skin integrity, with necrotic toes on the left foot and an open ulcer with eschar over the right medial malleolus. He has end-stage renal disease and is receiving dialysis. The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values, including a blood glucose level of 38 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis/severe sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular instability.
2. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level of 38 mg/dL is concerning for hypoglycemia, which may lead to neurological complications if not promptly treated.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's necrotic toes and open ulcer with eschar over the right medial malleolus may lead to further infection, cellulitis, or sepsis.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to further weight loss, weakness, and decreased immune function.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal potassium and creatinine levels, which may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and cardiovascular instability.
7. Dialysis complications: The patient's dialysis catheter may become infected or occluded, leading to further complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may be necessary, and further respiratory failure may occur if not properly managed."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD outside, and here (post abx)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Will need line pulled likely today.
   - f/u stool studies
   - f/[**Location 39**] CT read
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   - Renal aware patient is here; will f/u recs regarding pulling HD line
   - No need for HD currently
   - Continue MWF schedule
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue home medications
   .
   #. PVD: Patient has h/o severe PVD with multiple amputations and
   chronic osteomyelitis in recent past.
   - Appreciate vascular recs
   - Will Rx with abx as above
   - Will continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica.
   Morphine IV for breakthrough pain
   .
   #. HTN: Patient has h/o HTN but p/w borderline hypotension and possible
   septic shock, now normotensive
   - Will cont to hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF: Patient is currently hypovolemic with septic
   physiology.
   - Will hold lasix, diovan, and beta blocker as above
   - Will monitor CVP to ensure do not over-rescusitate given patient does
   not want to be intubated.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Very mild and could be [**2-10**] hypoperfusion in setting
   of transient hypotension in ED.
   - will hold statin
   - trend LFTs
   - consider RUQ U/S if does not resolve with fluids
   .
   #. Erythrocytosis: Hct is extremely high for him given baseline of
   mid-thirties on most recent hospitalization. Suspect hemoconcentration
   from combination of dialysis and sepsis.
   - will hydrate as above
   - will monitor daily hcts
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology given with infection usually get
   reactive thrombocytosis. Could be from nutritional deficiency given
   severe wasting and difficulty eating over last several months.
   - Will monitor plt count daily
   - Transfuse for plt<10K or <50K with evidence of bleeding.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Patient has recently been worked up for long h/o
   dysphagia which is likely [**2-10**] muscle weakness of deconditioning
   accompanied by severe reflux. Is now s/p G-tube placement for better
   nutrition supposed to start TFs today but because was at hospital did
   not get recs from VNA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a fever and sepsis. He has a high risk of developing complications due to his underlying medical conditions, including chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of severe malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by a line infection or osteomyelitis, and he is at risk of developing septic shock, multi-organ failure, and death.
2. Line Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and a dialysis catheter, which increases his risk of developing line-related infections.
3. Osteomyelitis: The patient's chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle is a potential source of infection, and he is at risk of developing septic arthritis, abscesses, and other complications.
4. PVD: The patient's severe PVD increases his risk of developing further amputations, gangrene, and other complications.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia, caused by sepsis and fluid loss, increases his risk of developing hypotension, shock, and multi-organ failure.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's mild transaminitis, caused by hypoperfusion, may progress to more severe liver damage if not treated promptly.
7. Erythrocytosis: The patient's high hematocrit, caused by hemoconcentration, increases his risk of developing thrombotic complications, such as pulmonary embolism.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia, caused by infection or nutritional deficiency, increases his risk of developing bleeding complications.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's severe malnutrition increases his risk of developing further complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and mortality.
10. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's G-tube placement and recent history of dysphagia increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration, nausea, and vomiting.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources of infection.
2. Monitor the patient's CVP and IVF to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Consider removing the CVC and dialysis catheter to prevent further infection.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider transfusing platelets if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider referring him to a nutritionist.
6. Consider referring the patient to a vascular surgeon to assess his PVD and potential for further amputations.
7. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider adjusting his antihypertensive medications as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and consider adjusting his medications as necessary.
9. Consider referring the patient to a gastroenterologist to assess his gastrointestinal symptoms and potential for further complications.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust his care plan as necessary to prevent further complications."

   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD outside, and here (post abx)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Will need line pulled likely today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with fever and sepsis. The patient has a high likelihood of having a central line infection, possibly related to his HD catheter. He is also at risk for other infections, including osteomyelitis of the right ankle, chronic osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has a history of hypertension, systolic congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with multiple amputations.

Physical Examination:

The patient is thin and emaciated, with poor dentition and a diminished radial pulse. He has a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. He has a warm skin temperature, but his extremities are cool. His neurologic examination is normal, but his toe on the left foot is necrotic, with an open ulcer and eschar over the right medial malleolus.

Lab Results:

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.9
* Hemoglobin: 10.8
* Platelet count: 36
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 38
* Creatinine: 2.2
* Glucose: 38
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

Plan:

The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, to cover for possible MRSA and pseudomonal infections. He will also receive IV fluids to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12 mmHg. The patient's HD line will be removed, and he will be placed on a MWF dialysis schedule. He will also receive pain management with oxycodone, tylenol, and lyrica, and will have his G-tube placement monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at high risk for sepsis due to his central line infection and other potential sources of infection.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
3. UTI: The patient is at risk for UTI due to his indwelling urinary catheter and history of UTI.
4. PVD: The patient has a history of PVD, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
6. CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could lead to further complications if left untreated.
8. Transaminitis: The patient has mildly elevated liver enzymes, which could be a sign of liver damage.
9. Erythrocytosis: The patient has a high hematocrit, which could be a sign of polycythemia vera or other blood disorders.
10. Nutrition: The patient has a history of dysphagia and is at risk for malnutrition due to his G-tube placement and history of aspiration.

Assessment:

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and treatment. He is at high risk for sepsis, osteomyelitis, UTI, PVD, hypertension, CHF, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, erythrocytosis, and malnutrition. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to manage his complex medical condition and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51.5 kg, 70-inch individual with a history of renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoglycemia, and alteration in nutrition. They are currently in the ICU with a small pneumoperitoneum, positive blood culture for a gram-negative organism, and receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and nutritional supplements.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, and blood pressure of 125/44 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and ABG results show a pH of 7.22. Laboratory results indicate abnormal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to impaired skin integrity and lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's positive blood culture and sepsis diagnosis make them at risk for sepsis progression, organ dysfunction, and potential mortality.
2. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and abnormal creatinine levels increase the risk of renal failure exacerbation, potentially leading to further electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disorders.
3. Hypoglycemia recurrence: The patient's history of hypoglycemia and current glucose levels of 38 mg/dL make them at risk for recurrent hypoglycemia, which can lead to neurological damage and mortality.
4. Skin integrity compromise: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown, infection, and potential sepsis.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results indicate potential pulmonary complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and phosphorus, increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Infection control: The patient's positive blood culture and sepsis diagnosis highlight the importance of strict infection control measures to prevent the spread of infection and potential sepsis progression."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD outside, and here (post abx)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Will need line pulled likely today.
   - f/u stool studies

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), admitted with fevers and sepsis, likely due to a central line infection. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic osteomyelitis of the right ankle, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hypertension (HTN), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and transaminitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 59 beats per minute, blood pressure of 125/44 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate level, consistent with sepsis. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the Gram-negative organism isolated from the blood culture suggests a possible line infection.

The patient's medical history and comorbidities make him at high risk for potential complications, including:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is likely to progress, leading to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Line-related complications: The patient's central line may become infected, leading to sepsis, bacteremia, and potential line-related complications such as pneumothorax or hemothorax.
3. Osteomyelitis-related complications: The patient's chronic osteomyelitis may worsen, leading to further bone destruction, sepsis, and potential systemic complications.
4. PVD-related complications: The patient's PVD may lead to further vascular compromise, potentially causing limb ischemia, gangrene, or even amputation.
5. CHF-related complications: The patient's CHF may worsen, leading to further cardiac decompensation, pulmonary edema, and potential cardiovascular instability.
6. Transaminitis-related complications: The patient's transaminitis may progress, leading to further liver dysfunction, potentially causing coagulopathy, bleeding, or encephalopathy.
7. Thrombocytopenia-related complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications, potentially causing gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or other life-threatening bleeding events.
8. Nutrition-related complications: The patient's malnutrition and dysphagia may worsen, leading to further weight loss, muscle wasting, and potential malnutrition-related complications such as weakness, fatigue, and decreased immune function.

The patient's plan of care includes continued broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and nutritional support. The patient's line will likely be pulled, and further imaging studies will be performed to assess for potential complications. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the patient is currently being managed in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82yo M with h/o ESRD on HD admitted with fevers
   and sepsis, likely [**2-10**] line infection.
   .
   #. Sepsis: Multiple sources for his infection including indwelling
   line, G-tube placed recently, PNA, chronic osteomyelitis of right
   ankle. Most likely is either osteomyelitis as recently d/c'd abx vs
   line infection.
   - Follow up cultures drawn in HD outside, and here (post abx)
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc (has h/o MRSA)/CFP ->
   will defer pseudomonal extended coverage, as PNA less likely than line
   infection.
   - IVF as needed to maintain pressures while transducing CVP to goal of
   12 as patient has h/o CHF will be more careful with IVF than usual ->
   current CVP 10, will give extra 500 NS in addition to maintenance D5NS
   at 100 cc/hr
   - follow up urine culture taken in ED ->currently covered for UTI with
   CFP
   - Discuss w/ renal over possible d/c of femoral line. Leaving  in for
   now.
   - f/u stool studies
   - f/[**Location 39**] CT read
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:
   - Renal aware patient is here; will f/u recs regarding pulling HD line
   - No need for HD currently
   - Continue MWF schedule
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue home medications
   .
   #. PVD: Patient has h/o severe PVD with multiple amputations and
   chronic osteomyelitis in recent past.
   - Appreciate vascular recs
   - Will Rx with abx as above
   - Will continue home pain regimen with oxycodone, tylenol, lyrica.
   Morphine IV for breakthrough pain
   .
   #. HTN: Patient has h/o HTN but p/w borderline hypotension and possible
   septic shock, now normotensive
   - Will cont to hold anti-hypertensives for now pending treatment of
   sepsis.
   .
   #. Systolic CHF: Patient is currently hypovolemic with septic
   physiology.
   - Will hold lasix, diovan, and beta blocker as above
   - Will monitor CVP to ensure do not over-rescusitate given patient does
   not want to be intubated.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: Very mild and could be [**2-10**] hypoperfusion in setting
   of transient hypotension in ED.
   - will hold statin
   - trend LFTs
   - consider RUQ U/S if does not resolve with fluids
   .
   #. Erythrocytosis: Hct is extremely high for him given baseline of
   mid-thirties on most recent hospitalization. Suspect hemoconcentration
   from combination of dialysis and sepsis.
   - will hydrate as above
   - will monitor daily hcts
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology given with infection usually get
   reactive thrombocytosis. Could be from nutritional deficiency given
   severe wasting and difficulty eating over last several months.
   - Will monitor plt count daily
   - Transfuse for plt<10K or <50K with evidence of bleeding.
   .
   #. Nutrition: Patient has recently been worked up for long h/o
   dysphagia which is likely [**2-10**] muscle weakness of deconditioning
   accompanied by severe reflux. Is now s/p G-tube placement for better
   nutrition supposed to start TFs today but because was at hospital did
   not get recs from VNA.
   - will have nutrition consult in am

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with fevers and sepsis, likely due to a central line infection.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 59 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 125/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 7 mmHg

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including:

* ESRD on HD
* Severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with multiple amputations and chronic osteomyelitis
* Hypertension (HTN)
* Systolic congestive heart failure (CHF)
* Transaminitis
* Erythrocytosis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Malnutrition

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected line infection, and his CVP is being monitored to ensure it does not exceed 12 mmHg. He is also receiving IV fluids as needed to maintain his blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly in his kidneys, liver, and lungs.
2. Line infection: The patient has a central line in place, which increases his risk for line infection and sepsis.
3. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis in his right ankle, which may complicate his current infection.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic lung disease, which increases his risk for developing pneumonia.
5. Hypovolemic shock: The patient is at risk for developing hypovolemic shock due to his history of CHF and sepsis.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of malnutrition, which may worsen his sepsis and increase his risk for complications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may increase his risk for bleeding complications.
8. Erythrocytosis: The patient has erythrocytosis, which may increase his risk for blood clots and pulmonary embolism.

Based on the patient's current condition and comorbidities, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent or manage potential complications."
