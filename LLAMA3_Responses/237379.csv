You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary kidney disease, admitted to the ICU due to a hypertensive emergency with EKG changes and troponin leak. She presented with left shoulder pain, which has since resolved after treatment with morphine, sublingual nitroglycerin, and labetalol. The patient is currently receiving labetalol infusion to maintain a goal blood pressure of 140-160 mmHg. She is also receiving insulin, metformin, and lisinopril, and has a history of sensitivity to missing anti-hypertensive medications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid-to-distal inferolateral wall, diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's kidney function is stable, but she has a history of anemia and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. This may lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and there is a risk of further complications such as cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, or acute kidney injury.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and there is a risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis if her diabetes is not well-controlled.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her kidney function declines or if she develops further bleeding.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may lead to further complications such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, or pancreatitis.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's kidney function is stable, but there is a risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if her blood pressure is not well-controlled or if she develops further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue labetalol infusion to maintain a goal blood pressure of 140-160 mmHg.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for further cardiac damage.
3. Continue insulin and metformin therapy to control blood glucose levels.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider adjusting her medication regimen if necessary.
5. Consider adding a low-dose statin to her medication regimen to manage her hyperlipidemia.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing her if her hemoglobin levels decline.
7. Consider stress testing or cardiac catheterization if the patient's clinical picture becomes more consistent with acute coronary syndrome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with left shoulder pain and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes, consistent with a hypertensive emergency. The patient's EKG changes have resolved, and her cardiac enzymes are trending towards peak levels. The patient's cardiac function is being monitored, and she is receiving treatment for hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Ischemic heart disease: The patient's EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest that she may be at risk for ischemic heart disease.
	* Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypertension and cardiac dysfunction may lead to cardiogenic shock.
	* Heart failure: The patient's mild bilateral pleural effusions and elevated JVP suggest that she may be at risk for heart failure.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest that she may be at risk for AKI.
	* Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient's pre-existing chronic kidney disease may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions and treatment.
3. Endocrine Complications:
	* Hyperglycemia: The patient's serum glucose levels are elevated, and she is at risk for hyperglycemia.
	* Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes treatment and potential insulin self-titration may lead to hypoglycemia.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her underlying medical conditions and treatment.
5. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and elevated JVP suggest that she may be at risk for pneumonia.
6. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's underlying medical conditions and treatment may lead to sepsis.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary kidney disease, and no prior history of coronary artery disease. She presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall, diastolic dysfunction, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 48-79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 137/51 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak of 1.52 ng/mL, and elevated CK-MB levels, with a peak of 20 IU/L. Her creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 29 mg/dL. Her hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, and her white blood cell count is 5.9 x 10^9/L.

The patient's medications include insulin, metoprolol, lisinopril, labetalol, and aspirin. She is also receiving heparin prophylaxis and dextrose 50% infusions.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. CAD: The patient is at risk for coronary artery disease due to her hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary kidney disease. She will be monitored for signs of myocardial infarction, and stress testing or coronary angiography may be considered if her symptoms worsen.
2. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with labetalol, and she will be weaned off the medication as tolerated.
3. DM2: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin, and her blood glucose levels will be closely monitored. She may be restarted on metformin if her creatinine levels remain stable.
4. CKI: The patient's creatinine levels are being closely monitored, and she will be considered for resumption of metformin if her creatinine levels remain stable.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid profile will be checked, and she may be started on a low-dose statin if her lipid levels are elevated.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia will be monitored, and she may be considered for transfusion if her hemoglobin levels drop below 21 g/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Myocardial infarction: The patient is at risk for myocardial infarction due to her hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary kidney disease.
2. Heart failure: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, which may indicate heart failure.
3. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with labetalol, and she will be weaned off the medication as tolerated.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin, and she may be at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis if her blood glucose levels become elevated.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may be at risk for kidney injury due to her hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygen saturation levels drop below 90%.

In summary, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary kidney disease, and no prior history of coronary artery disease. She presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. She is at risk for various medical complications, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertensive emergency, diabetic ketoacidosis, kidney injury, and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary kidney disease (CKI). She was admitted with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. The patient's blood pressure was initially elevated, but it has been controlled with labetalol infusion. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin leak, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated blood glucose levels (372 mg/dL on admission)
* Elevated creatinine levels (1.6 mg/dL)
* Elevated troponin levels (1.45 ng/mL)
* Elevated ALT and AST levels (91 IU/L and 29 IU/L, respectively)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Irregular rhythm with a normal rate
* Mild bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* 1+ leg edema

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Labetalol infusion for hypertension control
* Metoprolol and lisinopril for cardiovascular disease
* Insulin for diabetes management
* Humalog 75/25 for diabetes management
* Clopidogrel for cardiovascular disease

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac complications: given the patient's elevated troponin levels and history of cardiac disease, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
* Kidney complications: given the patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of CKI, there is a risk of kidney damage or failure.
* Diabetic complications: given the patient's elevated blood glucose levels and history of diabetes, there is a risk of diabetic complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or nephropathy.
* Hypertensive complications: given the patient's history of hypertension and hypertensive emergency, there is a risk of hypertensive complications such as stroke, heart failure, or kidney damage.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to closely monitor her blood pressure, cardiac enzymes, and kidney function, as well as adjust her medications and treatment plan as necessary to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency and presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes. Her troponin levels are elevated, and she has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall. She has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 137/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F) and is on a nasal cannula with 100% oxygen. Her respiratory support includes an ABG of 30/30/30.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin-T, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating possible cardiac damage. Her kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Her hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, and her platelet count is 261 K/uL.

The patient's medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, clopidogrel, and insulin. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage. She may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and ischemic events.
2. Kidney damage: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. She may be at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease progression.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia and urinary tract infections, given her impaired immune function and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support includes an ABG of 30/30/30, indicating possible respiratory failure. She may be at risk for respiratory acidosis and respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given her impaired platelet function and prolonged hospitalization.
6. Neurological complications: The patient may be at risk for neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures, given her hypertension and impaired kidney function.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, indicating possible hyperglycemia. She may be at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating possible anemia. She may be at risk for anemia-related complications, such as fatigue and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Consider stress vs. cath if clinical picture becomes more consistent
   with ACS
   - Risk stratification with A1C and lipid panel
   .
   # Hypertensive emergency:  Unclear precipitant. Pt does have hx of
   sensitivity to missing anti-hypertensive meds. Currently on labetalol
   gtt. Denies recent headaches, visual changes, decreased UOP, or other
   signs of end organ damage.
   - Continue Labetalol gtt to maintain goal BP 140-160, wean as tolerated
   while transitioning to home meds
   - Resume home Metoprolol and Lisinopril
   - Check urinalysis for signs of ATN and monitor Cr
   .
   # DM2: serum glucose 372 on admission. Pt on insulin at home. Last
   HbA1c on [**11-4**] elevated at 11.6. Pt reports compliance with insulin,
   but did self-titrate down insulin last week. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6055**] at
   [**Hospital 303**] Clinic.
   - Continue home Humalog 75/25

   - Consider touching base with [**Last Name (un) 303**] if bs remain uncontrolled on
   current regimen
   .
   # CKI: Cr on admission 1.3, appears to be at baseline (was 1.3 in
   [**11-4**], and has been higher in the past.) - Monitor daily Cr
   - Check u/a for signs of ATN given hypertensive urgency
   - Consider resuming home Metformin for DM2 if Cr stable in am
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Pt has reported hx of hyperlipidemia, but is not on a
   lipid-lowering medication at home, and unclear what baseline lipid
   status is.
   - Check lipid profile, consider adding low-dose statin+
   .
   # Anemia: crit currently 32.1, at baseline (~32-33). No active signs of

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female who presents with L shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of hypertensive emergency. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and cardiac kidney disease. She is currently being treated for hypertensive emergency with labetalol gtt, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with troponin T levels of 1.52 ng/mL, and her EKG shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall. She has also been diagnosed with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% on nasal cannula oxygen. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure of 137/51 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of AST (91 IU/L), ALT (29 IU/L), and creatinine (1.6 mg/dL). Her hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, and her platelet count is 261 K/uL.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Repeat EKG to monitor for any changes in cardiac enzymes.
2. Monitor on telemetry to track any changes in heart rhythm.
3. Trend cardiac enzymes till peaks.
4. Resume Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
5. ECHO in am to evaluate baseline cardiac function.
6. Consider stress vs. cath if clinical picture becomes more consistent with ACS.
7. Risk stratification with A1C and lipid panel.
8. Continue Labetalol gtt to maintain goal BP 140-160, wean as tolerated while transitioning to home meds.
9. Resume home Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
10. Check urinalysis for signs of ATN and monitor Cr.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac ischemia or infarction due to the patient's elevated troponin levels and EKG changes.
2. Hypertensive crisis or worsening of hypertension if the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
3. Respiratory failure or worsening of respiratory status if the patient's oxygen saturation levels drop or if she experiences respiratory distress.
4. Renal failure or worsening of kidney function if the patient's creatinine levels continue to rise or if she experiences acute tubular necrosis.
5. Anemia or worsening of anemia if the patient's hemoglobin levels continue to decline or if she experiences bleeding.
6. Infection or sepsis if the patient's white blood cell count continues to rise or if she experiences fever or chills.
7. Cardiovascular instability or arrhythmias if the patient's heart rhythm changes or if she experiences cardiac ischemia or infarction.

Based on the patient's current condition and plan of care, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and cardiac enzymes to prevent or manage any potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease who presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. She has a history of sensitivity to missing anti-hypertensive medications and is currently on labetalol infusion to control her blood pressure. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and she has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall on echocardiogram. She is also experiencing mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient's EKG changes and elevated troponin levels suggest that she may be experiencing an ischemic event, which could lead to further cardiac complications if left untreated.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and if not controlled, could lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, cerebral edema, and acute kidney injury.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, and her current level is 1.6, suggesting that she may be at risk for acute kidney injury, especially given her history of chronic kidney disease.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's serum glucose level is 372, and she is experiencing cold sweats, which could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Cardiac Failure: The patient's echocardiogram shows mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which could lead to cardiac failure if left untreated.
6. Anemia: The patient's critical care level is 32.1, and she is at risk for further anemia if not treated promptly.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and lack of treatment may increase her risk for further cardiovascular complications.
8. Catheter-Related Complications: The patient has a central line and a Foley catheter, which could increase her risk for catheter-related complications such as infection and bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue labetalol infusion to control the patient's blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for further cardiac complications.
3. Consider stress testing or catheterization to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out ischemic heart disease.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and consider dialysis if it continues to rise.
5. Consider insulin therapy to control the patient's blood glucose level and prevent diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further treatment if she develops signs of cardiac failure.
7. Consider transfusions if the patient's critical care level continues to decline.
8. Monitor the patient's lipid profile and consider adding a low-dose statin if necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
10. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) **], MD
   on:[**2181-3-2**] 09:36 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary kidney disease, admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency, acute diastolic congestive heart failure, and a recent cardiac catheterization showing 3-vessel disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48-79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids, lasix, and heparin for prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated creatinine, and elevated troponin-T levels.

The patient's medical conditions include hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary kidney disease, and possible acute kidney injury. The patient's medications include insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and metoprolol, which were continued from home. The patient was started on amlodipine and is being weaned off nitroglycerin.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of hypertension, leading to increased cardiovascular risk.
2. Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, leading to electrolyte imbalances and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemia, leading to metabolic acidosis and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
4. Coronary artery disease, leading to increased risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events.
5. Pulmonary edema, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Infection, leading to sepsis and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
7. Venous thromboembolism, leading to pulmonary embolism and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and medication management. The patient's family has been informed of the patient's condition and the plan of care, and the patient's code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and coronary kidney disease, who presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. She was found to have 3-vessel disease on cardiac catheterization. Her condition has improved with treatment, but she remains at risk for complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic Heart Disease: The patient's EKG changes and troponin leak suggest possible ischemic heart disease, which may lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
2. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's initial hypertensive emergency has improved, but she may still be at risk for recurrent episodes, which could lead to further complications such as cerebral edema, cardiac failure, or renal failure.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's history of diabetes type 2 and her current treatment with insulin and metformin put her at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, which could lead to severe metabolic complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's history of coronary kidney disease and her current treatment with nephrotoxic medications put her at risk for acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences bleeding or if her underlying condition worsens, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac failure or respiratory failure.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and her current respiratory failure put her at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory arrest.
7. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac disease and her current treatment with medications that can affect cardiac rhythm put her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and coronary kidney disease, admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency and EKG changes. She presented with left shoulder pain, and a cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease. The patient's blood pressure is now improved with labetalol, but she still requires close monitoring. She is on insulin, metformin, and lisinopril, and her lab results show elevated troponin and creatinine levels. The patient is also anemic and has mild bilateral pleural effusions consistent with mild heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic Etiology: The patient's EKG changes and troponin leak suggest an ischemic etiology, which needs to be monitored closely.
2. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored to prevent further complications.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient's mild bilateral pleural effusions and elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac failure, which needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she has a history of kidney disease, which increases the risk of renal failure.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's blood sugar levels are elevated, and she is on insulin, which increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be monitored and managed, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and lack of lipid-lowering medication increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness and history of coronary kidney disease increase the risk of stress ulcer.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation and history of chronic lung disease increase the risk of VAP.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and history of coronary kidney disease increase the risk of DVT."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease, admitted to the ICU for hypertensive emergency and acute coronary syndrome. She presented with left shoulder pain and EKG changes. Her current condition is characterized by mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She has been treated with IV lasix, heparin, and amlodipine, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of cardiac disease and the presence of mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the use of IV lasix may increase the risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the presence of crackles in both lungs may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and the use of IV fluids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
5. Infection: The patient's history of chronic diseases and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the use of anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and the use of IV fluids may increase the risk of hyperglycemia, which may lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her condition to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 83 y/o F with HTN, DM2 on insulin, CKI, no prior CAD hx
   who presents with L shoulder pain and EKG changes in setting of
   hypertensive emergency now s/p cath with report of 3Vd. Final report
   not available.
   .
   #. CAD: Pt presenting with EKG changes and troponin leak in setting of
   hypertensive emergency with L shoulder pain, concern for ischemic
   etiology but most likely [**1-29**] demand in setting of hypertension. Chest
   pain resolved. Repeat EKG showed decreased ST deviations with
   resolution of CP. Pt now s/p cardiac cath with 3VD
   - Cardiac cath this AM
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Cont ASA 325 PO daily, clopidogrel
   - Cont Metoprolol and Lisinopril
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Doctor First Name 213**] recs
   .
   # Hypertensive emergency:  Unclear precipitant, possibly from missing
   anti-hypertensive meds. BP now improved s/p labetalol gtt.
   - Cont home Metoprolol and Lisinopril
   - Check urinalysis for signs of ATN and monitor Cr
   - continue nitro gtt
   .
   # DM2: serum glucose 372 on admission. Pt on insulin at home. Last
   HbA1c on [**11-4**] elevated at 11.6. Pt reports compliance with insulin,
   but did self-titrate down insulin last week. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6055**] at
   [**Hospital 303**] Clinic.
   - Continue home Humalog 75/25
   - FS Qachs, HISS PRN
   - Consider resuming home Metformin if Cr stable in am
   - HbA1c pending
   - Consider touching base with [**Last Name (un) 303**] if bs remain uncontrolled on
   current regimen
   .
   # CKI: Cr on admission 1.3, appears to be at baseline (was 1.3 in
   [**11-4**], and has been higher in the past.) - Monitor daily Cr
   - Check u/a for signs of ATN given hypertensive urgency
   - Consider resuming home Metformin for DM2 if Cr stable in am
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Pt has reported hx of hyperlipidemia, but is not on a
   lipid-lowering medication at home, and unclear what baseline lipid
   status is.
   - Check lipid profile, consider adding low-dose statin+
   .
   # Anemia: crit currently 32.1, at baseline (~32-33). No active signs of
   bleeding.
   - Monitor daily crits
   - Fe studies pending
   - Transfusion goal >21 (or >25 if clinical picture evolves into ACS)
   .
   #. Pump: No prior hx of ECHO per pt or in OMR. JVP elevated, and CXR
   shows mild bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with mild heart
   failure.
   - ECHO in am to eval baseline cardiac function

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypertensive emergency, left shoulder pain, and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed three-vessel disease (3VD). The patient's condition is being managed with labetalol infusion, metoprolol, and lisinopril. Her diabetes regimen includes insulin and metformin, and her hyperlipidemia is being monitored. The patient is also being treated for anemia and is receiving cardiac and diabetic diet.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's EKG changes and troponin leak suggest possible ischemic heart disease, which may be exacerbated by her hypertension.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed 3VD, which may lead to cardiac failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.3, and her current level is 1.6, suggesting possible AKI.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and she is at risk of developing hyperglycemic complications.
5. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she is at risk of developing further complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase her risk of cardiovascular disease.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be adequate, and she is at risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to her prolonged stay in the ICU.
10. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and hypertension.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."
