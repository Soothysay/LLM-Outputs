   Assessment and Plan
   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely multifactorial, in the setting of
   medication effect (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure),
   especially given stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased
   medication clearance, age, in the setting of procedures, and lack of
   sleep. Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue low dose ASA, high dose statin, metoprolol, can d/c plavix
   after a few days
   - d/c integrilin given pt
s stage IV CKD
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Consider optimize medical treatment by adding imdur if having
   persistent chest pain
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate PR this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   - monitor glucose with insulin on board in the setting of acute on
   chronic renal failure
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.  Expect to see
   worsening renal function in the next 24-48h.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   - monitor for acidosis
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  CXR consistent with heart failure.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold lisinopril given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold all home hypoglycemics while in-house,
   especially in setting of recent contrast load.
   - RISS
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline hct 30.  Currently hct is at baseline
   - trend Hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old male admitted for elective cardiac catheterization for symptoms of unstable angina. The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday, and 2 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions were intervened on.

The patient is currently experiencing delirium, which is likely multifactorial in nature, considering the patient's age, stage IV CKD, decreased medication clearance, and lack of sleep. The patient's mental status is non-focal, and there is no evidence of thrombo-embolic event or cerebrovascular accident. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/58 mmHg.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 5.2 mmol/L, which is slightly elevated. The patient is not receiving medications that increase potassium, and ACEI has been held. The patient's EKG shows no changes.
2. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV CKD, with a creatinine clearance of 23. The patient received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after catheterization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, which is concerning for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
3. PUMP: The patient's right heart catheterization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA pressures. The patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, and 20mg IV lasix was given in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by midnight.
4. Moderate Aortic Stenosis: The patient has an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm2. The patient's chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct is 30, and currently, Hct is at baseline.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. NPO for now, with cardiac healthy, diabetic, renal diet once delirium resolves.
2. Continue low-dose ASA, high-dose statin, metoprolol, and consider optimizing medical treatment by adding imdur if having persistent chest pain.
3. Hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath.
5. Trend and get pm lytes, monitor glucose with insulin on board in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
6. Monitor for acidosis.
7. No lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS patients are pre-load dependent.
8. Continue metoprolol, hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure.
9. Strict I/Os, daily weight.
10. Consider optimizing medical treatment by adding imdur if having persistent chest pain.

The patient's disposition is to call out to Hospital1 once not delirious."

   concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect (likely [**2-19**]
   benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given stage IV
   chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance. Neuro exam
   non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic event/CVA. No
   evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of hypotension or
   hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to be infectious in
   nature.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU for elective cardiac catheterization for symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU for peri-operative delirium. The patient has a history of multiple CAD risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and has been found to have 2VD, including 3 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions. The patient's current condition includes agitation, difficulty concentrating, and elevated CK levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's agitation and difficulty concentrating may be related to medication effects, particularly benzodiazepines given peri-procedure. The patient's stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance may also contribute to the delirium.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be secondary to chronic kidney disease. The patient has been given insulin, D5, and kayexalate to manage this condition.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and chest pain may indicate the development of pneumonia.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization and the presence of 2VD may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of nasal cannula oxygen and the presence of chronic kidney disease may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and the presence of IV lines and drains may increase the risk of infection.
8. Thromboembolic Event: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and the presence of cardiac catheterization may increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will continue to be monitored for delirium, hyperkalemia, and cardiac complications. The patient's medication regimen will be adjusted as necessary to manage these conditions. The patient's cardiac catheterization results will be reviewed to determine the best course of treatment. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored to prevent acute kidney injury. The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored to prevent respiratory failure."

   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect
   (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given
   stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance.
   Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - can restart lisinopril today
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  Appears euvolemic currently.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart lisinopril

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, an 89-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU for elective cardiac catheterization due to symptoms of unstable angina. He was transferred to the CCU due to peri-operative delirium. The patient's current condition is agitated, but his neuro exam is non-focal. He has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. His recent cardiac catheterization revealed 2VD, including 3 tight LAD lesions and LCx lesions, with 2 of the LAD lesions intervened upon. His current medications include eptifibatide, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and plavix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine level increased from 2.1 to 2.4 after the cardiac catheterization, which may be a sign of contrast-induced nephropathy complicating his chronic kidney disease.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may be secondary to his chronic kidney disease or medications that increase potassium levels.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac catheterization may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and recent cardiac catheterization may increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and recent cardiac catheterization may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
7. Delirium: The patient's ongoing delirium may increase his risk of developing other medical complications, such as falls, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's potassium level closely and adjust his medications accordingly.
2. Continue to trend the patient's creatinine level and urine output to monitor for acute kidney injury.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medications accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his medications accordingly.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to further manage the patient's chronic kidney disease.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to further manage the patient's coronary artery disease."

   89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective cardiac
   cath for symptoms of unstable angina. Transferred to CCU for
   peri-operative delerium.
   .
   # Delerium: Patient exhibited symptoms of delerium yesterday, including
   difficulty concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect
   (likely [**2-19**] benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given
   stage IV chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance.
   Neuro exam non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic
   event/CVA. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of
   hypotension or hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to
   be infectious in nature.  Currently patient is sleeping, difficult to
   arouse but does wake up briefly before falling asleep again.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics
   - tylenol standing for pain
   - no head imaging required at this time
   .
   # CORONARIES: Patient with multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
   HLD, and CKD. 2VD on cardiac cath yesterday, including 3 tight LAD
   lesions and LCx lesions. 2 tight LAD lesions were intervened on, but
   not the third LAD lesion and the LCx lesion.  CK significantly elevated
   this AM, 152 to 860.
   - continue full dose ASA, plavix, high dose statin, metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - Consider take pt back to cath lab if having persistent chest pain, or
   optimize medical treatment by adding imdur
   - continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: K was 5.2 on admission, 5.9 this AM.  Not getting
   medications that increase K. ACEI has been held.  Could be secondary to
   chronic kidney disease.  EKG showed no changes.  Patient was given
   insulin, D5, kayexalate this AM.
   - continue to trend, get pm lytes
   .
   # Chronic Kidney Disease: Stage IV CKD, w/ Cre clearance of 23.
   Received pre-cath hydration and IV mucomyst before and after
   catherization, but creatinine still bumped from 2.1 to 2.4, concerning
   for contrast-induced nephropathy complicating CKD.
   - renally dose meds
   - get pm lytes
   .
   # PUMP: Right heart catherization shows elevated LVEDP, PCWPs, and PA
   pressures.  TTE from [**6-26**] showed LVEF 50-55%, but nuclear stress test
   in [**7-26**] showed LV function slightly decreased with EF of 46% and
   global hypokinesis. Patient received NS and bicarb prior to cath, s/p
   20mg IV lasix in the cath lab post-cath with I/O overall negative by
   midnight per nursing.  Appears euvolemic currently.
   - no lasix today as pt appears euvolemic, creatinine bumped, and AS
   patients are pre-load dependent
   - continue metoprolol
   - hold off on lisinopril today given acute on chronic renal failure
   - strict I/Os
   - daily weight
   .
   # Moderate AS: Patient with echo finding of aortic valve area of
   1.0cm2. Chest pain is likely from ACS, not from AS.
   - restart lisinopril today
   - Since patient is currently asymptomatic from moderate AS, would hold
   off on Csurg consult
   - avoid nitroglycerin given pre-load dependence from AS
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient had  sinus tachycardia on EKG on transfer to CCU,
   likely in setting of delerium, discomfort s/p procedures.  Patient was
   given metoprolol for tachycardia yesterday, he responded well to
   metoprolol.
   - continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor on tele

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Hemodynamic monitoring: Heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, with a cardiac index of 2.1 L/min/m2.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,533 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 520 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 91%.
* Physical examination: The patient is sleeping, with a supple neck and no evidence of jugular venous distension. His cardiac examination is normal, with no murmurs, thrills, or lifts. His lungs are clear, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.
* Neurological examination: The patient is agitated, but his neuro exam is non-focal.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.4 K/uL, his hemoglobin is 33.6 g/dL, and his platelet count is 249 K/uL. His creatinine is 2.4 mg/dL, and his potassium is 5.3 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 2.1 to 2.4 mg/dL, which may be a sign of contrast-induced nephropathy.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he has received a significant amount of fluid over the past 24 hours, which may increase his risk of acute kidney injury.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which may be due to chronic kidney disease or medications.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, but he may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias due to his underlying cardiac condition and medications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 91%, which may indicate mild respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* NPO status
* Continue IV zyprexa prn for agitation
* Hold all benzodiazepines and anticholinergics
* Continue metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
* Monitor for signs of infection
* Trend Hct
* Continue IV cefazolin x3 doses post-cath
* Consider taking the patient back to the cath lab if he has persistent chest pain or optimize medical treatment by adding imdur."

   # Delerium: Patient exhibits symptoms of delerium including difficulty
   concentration, likely in the setting of medication effect (likely [**2-19**]
   benzodiazapines given peri-procedure), especially given stage IV
   chronic kidney disease and decreased medication clearance. Neuro exam
   non-focal, so unlikely patient had thrombo-embolic event/CVA. No
   evidence of retroperitoneal bleed (no evidence of hypotension or
   hematocrit drop). Change in mental status too acute to be infectious in
   nature.
   - NPO for now
   - continue wrist restraints
   - IV zyprexa prn for agitation
   - hold all benzos, anticholinergics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Glucose: 179-211 mg/dL
* Potassium: 5.2-5.9 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Stage IV chronic kidney disease
* Unstable angina
* Moderate aortic stenosis
* Diabetes mellitus
* Anemia

The patient is being treated with various medications, including:

* Eptifibatide (Integrilin) for platelet inhibition
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis
* Metoprolol for tachycardia and hypertension
* Lisinopril for hypertension and heart failure
* Cefazolin for antibiotic prophylaxis
* Lasix for fluid management
* Insulin and D5 for glucose control
* Kayexalate for hyperkalemia

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Delirium: The patient's symptoms of delirium, including difficulty concentrating, may worsen or become more resistant to treatment.
* Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels may continue to rise, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent use of contrast media may increase his risk of acute kidney injury.
* Heart failure: The patient's moderate aortic stenosis and recent cardiac catheterization may increase his risk of heart failure.
* Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and catheters may increase his risk of infection.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes mellitus and recent use of insulin may increase his risk of hypoglycemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing full dose ASA, Plavix, high-dose statin, and metoprolol
* Restarting lisinopril and considering adding ACEI and imdur
* Continuing IV cefazolin for antibiotic prophylaxis
* Monitoring potassium levels and treating hyperkalemia as necessary
* Trending creatinine levels and adjusting medications as necessary
* Monitoring for signs of heart failure and adjusting treatment as necessary
* Continuing to manage the patient's diabetes mellitus and anemia."
