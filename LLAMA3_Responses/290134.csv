   is presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness. her pneumonia appears to
   have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Nonetheless, she is
   on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness preceeded her
   critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process. She
   does not appear to have had prlongued illness or steroid use.

   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 150/87 mmHg. Her respiratory status is improving, with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 447 mmHg and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's neurological examination reveals mild weakness in her proximal muscles, including the deltoids, biceps, and triceps. She has a decreased range of motion in her shoulders and hips, and her reflexes are decreased. Her deep tendon reflexes are absent in her legs.

The patient's laboratory results show mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 76,000/μL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 18 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 69 IU/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

The patient's diagnosis is likely related to her underlying condition of cryoglobulinemia, which is associated with HCV. The patient's symptoms of weakness, dysphagia, and respiratory failure are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's laboratory results, including her mildly elevated LFTs and thrombocytopenia, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued antibiotic therapy for her pneumonia, as well as management of her cryoglobulinemia with peg interferon maintenance. She will also be started on a 10-day course of cefepime and moxifloxacin for her pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying condition of cryoglobulinemia may lead to respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by her pneumonia.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination reveals mild weakness in her proximal muscles, which could worsen over time. She may also be at risk for neurological complications such as neuropathy or myopathy.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is mildly decreased, which could increase her risk for bleeding complications.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are mildly elevated, which could indicate liver dysfunction. This could lead to complications such as ascites, encephalopathy, or coagulopathy.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia may not be fully treated, which could lead to further complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.

In conclusion, the patient's diagnosis is likely related to her underlying condition of cryoglobulinemia, and her treatment plan includes management of her cryoglobulinemia with peg interferon maintenance and antibiotic therapy for her pneumonia. The patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, neurological complications, thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach today at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent
   is presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness. her pneumonia appears to
   have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Nonetheless, she is
   on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness preceeded her
   critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, will get ID approval
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; did well with
   decrease PS this morning
   - try sitting upright to see if diaphragmatic paralysis
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult and will touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4690**]; plan for possible
   nerve biopsy and / or EMG
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs
   - continue IFN Q week, although need to consider IFN as toxic cause of
   her myopathy
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopping ranitidine today
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and aspiration pneumonia. She has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 150/87 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient has a history of neuromuscular weakness, which is suspected to be related to cryoglobulinemia. She has also been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure and is on a 7-day course of antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 76 K/uL. Her troponin level is 0.18 ng/mL, and her creatine kinase level is 98 IU/L.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to her aspiration pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Neuromuscular weakness: The patient's neuromuscular weakness is suspected to be related to cryoglobulinemia and may be a result of her underlying condition or a complication of her critical illness.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to pain and may also be related to fluid overload.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely related to her underlying condition and may be a result of her critical illness.
5. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI is likely related to demand ischemia at OSH and may be a complication of her critical illness.
6. Dysphagia: The patient's dysphagia is likely related to her aspiration pneumonia and may be a complication of her critical illness.
7. FEN: The patient's FEN is likely related to her underlying condition and may be a result of her critical illness.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics for 10 days.
2. Weaning from ventilation and attempting to sit upright to assess for diaphragmatic paralysis.
3. Consulting neurology and liver disease specialists to determine the etiology of the patient's muscle weakness.
4. Ordering a nerve biopsy and/or EMG to evaluate the nature of the patient's myopathy.
5. Continuing PPI therapy and stopping ranitidine.
6. Holding all heparin products and checking for HIT Ab.
7. Trending troponins and CKs to monitor for NSTEMI.
8. Maintaining fluids and repleting electrolytes.
9. Placing a PEG tube or NG tube for nutrition.
10. Providing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach today at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent
   is presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness. her pneumonia appears to
   have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Nonetheless, she is
   on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness preceeded her
   critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, will get ID approval
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; did well with
   decrease PS this morning
   - try sitting upright to see if diaphragmatic paralysis
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call

   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach today at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent
   is presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness. her pneumonia appears to
   have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Nonetheless, she is
   on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness preceeded her
   critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, will get ID approval
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; did well with
   decrease PS this morning
   - try sitting upright to see if diaphragmatic paralysis
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult and will touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4690**]; plan for possible
   nerve biopsy and / or EMG
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs
   - continue IFN Q week, although need to consider IFN as toxic cause of
   her myopathy
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopping ranitidine today
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - PPI

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a complex medical history, including HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, neuromuscular weakness, and suspected NSTEMI.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Hypoxic respiratory failure, resolving pneumonia, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to neuromuscular weakness.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, likely due to pain or fluid overload, with a recent NSTEMI diagnosis.
* Neurological: Neuromuscular weakness, suspected mixed cryoglobulinemia-associated myopathy/neuropathy, with a plan for nerve biopsy and EMG.
* Gastrointestinal: Dysphagia, laryngeal reflux, and potential PEG tube placement.
* Hematological: Thrombocytopenia, with a baseline of 50-70,000 and a current count of 20,000, with a plan to trend and transfuse as needed.
* Infections: Pneumonia, cleared rapidly, with a 7-day course of antibiotics.
* Medications: Cefepime, morphine, ativan, metoprolol, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and IV fluids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Continued difficulty weaning from the ventilator, with a risk of reintubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular complications: Continued tachycardia, with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, and potential cardiac arrest.
3. Neurological complications: Progressive neuromuscular weakness, with a risk of respiratory failure, and potential need for tracheostomy.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: Continued dysphagia, with a risk of aspiration and respiratory failure, and potential need for PEG tube placement.
5. Hematological complications: Continued thrombocytopenia, with a risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
6. Infections: Potential for secondary infections, such as pneumonia, and sepsis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics for pneumonia.
2. Weaning from the ventilator, with a plan for daily RSBI and SBT.
3. Sitting upright to assess diaphragmatic paralysis.
4. Consultation with neurology and liver specialists to determine the etiology of muscle weakness.
5. Follow-up on muscle and nerve biopsy results.
6. Management of tachycardia with morphine and IV metoprolol.
7. Continued prophylaxis for pneumoboots and stress ulcer.
8. Monitoring of electrolytes and blood glucose levels.
9. Trending and transfusing platelets as needed.
10. Holding all heparin products due to thrombocytopenia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent potential complications and optimize her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old patient in the ICU with a sural nerve biopsy, liver with a Dobhoff tube for nutrition, and hydroxyzine for itching. They have a history of tachycardia, which improved with fluid boluses, morphine, ativan, and IV metoprolol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 139/81 mmHg. They are receiving respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's physical examination is generally normal, with the exception of some neurologic deficits, including inability to squeeze eyes, minimal upward gaze, and decreased muscle strength.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute and a respiratory system compliance of 32.1 cmH2O/mL. This may indicate the need for further respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 0.3 mg/dL, which may indicate kidney damage or failure.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating potential liver damage or dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL. This may indicate the need for electrolyte replacement therapy.
5. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 6.4 K/uL, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
6. Myopathy: The patient's muscle strength is decreased, which may indicate the presence of a myopathy.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition is compromised, which may lead to malnutrition and decreased immune function.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, which may lead to pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers.
9. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobility and the presence of a central line.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic status. They also require further evaluation and management of their liver dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, and potential sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4-6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 29.5-31.9 g/dL, platelet count of 76-107 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.14-0.18 ng/mL, and their TCO2 level is 27 mmHg. The patient's other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's medications include morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and metoprolol. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their impaired skin integrity and myopathy. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessable, and their skin examination is not performed. The patient's neurologic examination is not performed due to their altered mental status.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and myopathy. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's impaired skin integrity and myopathy can increase their risk of developing sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase their risk of bleeding.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is within normal limits, but their kidney function should be closely monitored.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and impaired skin integrity can increase their risk of developing pneumonia.
7. DVT: The patient's DVT prophylaxis should be continued to prevent deep vein thrombosis.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis should be continued to prevent stress ulcer bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is a 24-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and myopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, and their laboratory results are within normal limits. The patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, bleeding, renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, DVT, and stress ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, last day today
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; continuing to
   improve, will do trach collar trial today
   - NIF is still -18 today
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult; plan for EMG and a nerve biopsy with neurosurg (Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 67**]
   - will follow up OSH biopsy, plan is to have specimen sent to [**Hospital1 **] after
   it is fixed
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed no ascites; question is
   now PEG v. dobhoff
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   - HCV virus and cyro levels pending
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - on maintenance fluids for now
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI; will switch from IV to PO nadolol when access to gut
   is achieved
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed; likely can be
   placed since no ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
 results pending
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement per liver recs, likely should
   have PEG to avoid two procedures as likely will need long term feeding
   options
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - PPI
   - no heparin problems
   .

   - RIJ from OSH removed, now with PIVs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, last day today
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; continuing to
   improve, will do trach collar trial today
   - NIF is still -18 today
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult; plan for EMG and a nerve biopsy with neurosurg (Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 67**]
   - will follow up OSH biopsy, plan is to have specimen sent to [**Hospital1 **] after
   it is fixed
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed no ascites; question is
   now PEG v. dobhoff
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   - HCV virus and cyro levels pending
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - on maintenance fluids for now
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI; will switch from IV to PO nadolol when access to gut
   is achieved
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed; likely can be
   placed since no ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
 results pending
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement per liver recs, likely should
   have PEG to avoid two procedures as likely will need long term feeding
   options

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's condition has improved, and she is now on a 7-day course of antibiotics. The plan is to continue weaning her from the ventilator and to perform a tracheostomy collar trial. The patient's myopathy/neuropathy is suspected to be related to mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV. The patient's laboratory results show mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy and myopathic process in several proximal muscles.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not continue to improve and wean from the ventilator.
2. Neuromuscular weakness: The patient's neuromuscular weakness may progress and affect her ability to breathe and swallow.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may recur or develop secondary infections, such as pneumonitis.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia may indicate cardiac instability, and her NSTEMI may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen and increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's dysphagia may lead to aspiration and pneumonia, and her gastrointestinal tract may be at risk for bleeding or perforation.
7. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase the risk of infections, such as sepsis or opportunistic infections.
8. Hepatitis C: The patient's HCV infection may worsen and lead to liver failure or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and wean her from the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Perform a tracheostomy collar trial to assess the patient's ability to breathe without the ventilator.
3. Continue antibiotics for 7 days and reassess the patient's pneumonia.
4. Monitor the patient's neuromuscular weakness and consider further evaluation with EMG and nerve biopsy.
5. Continue to manage the patient's tachycardia and NSTEMI with medication and cardiac monitoring.
6. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and transfuse platelets as needed.
7. Continue to manage the patient's dysphagia and consider placement of a PEG tube.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal tract for signs of bleeding or perforation.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's infections and consider prophylaxis with antibiotics.
10. Consider referral to a liver specialist for further evaluation and management of the patient's HCV infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, last day today
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; continuing to
   improve, will do trach collar trial today
   - NIF is still -18 today
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult; plan for EMG and a nerve biopsy with neurosurg (Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 67**]
   - will follow up OSH biopsy, plan is to have specimen sent to [**Hospital1 **] after
   it is fixed
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed no ascites; question is
   now PEG v. dobhoff
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - on maintenance fluids for now
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed; likely can be
   placed since no ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - PPI
   .
   # Access:
   - RIJ from OSH (placed on [**1-18**]); plan for PIVs and then d/c of RIJ if
   possible

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness.
* She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
* Her respiratory failure is resolving, and she is now on a 7-day course of antibiotics.
* She has a tracheostomy in place and is being weaned from the ventilator.
* Her muscle weakness is suspected to be related to cryoglobulinemia, and she is undergoing a muscle and nerve biopsy to determine the nature of her myopathy.
* She has a history of thrombocytopenia, and her platelet count is currently in the 20s. She is being transfused and held on heparin products.
* She has a history of NSTEMI, and her troponins are trending downward.
* She is being treated for tachycardia with morphine and IV metoprolol.
* She has dysphagia and is being evaluated by neurology, ENT, and speech therapy.
* She is on maintenance fluids and is being repleted with electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia or pneumonitis due to aspiration or respiratory failure.
2. Worsening of muscle weakness and myopathy/neuropathy due to cryoglobulinemia.
3. Bleeding or hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia.
4. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to NSTEMI.
5. Gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or bleeding, due to dysphagia.
6. Infection or sepsis due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression.
7. Nutritional deficiencies due to inadequate nutrition or malabsorption.
8. Respiratory failure or arrest due to weaning from the ventilator.
9. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to cryoglobulinemia or NSTEMI.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, as well as coordination with multiple specialties, including neurology, gastroenterology, and cardiology."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.  Working diagnosis is an INF
   related primary myopathy with an underlying secondary neuropathy
   related to cyroglobulemiia.  Neuro and neurosurg following
   - cyro levels pending
   - plan to review OSH muscle biopsies with neuro. OSH doctor is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
   call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - possible plan for nerve biopsy tomorrow, may be pending the muscle
   biopsy results whether or not it is needed; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 67**] is following and
   she is scheduled for OR tomorrow
   - appreciate neuro and neurosurg recs
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, [**1-27**]
   - doing well on trach mask trial
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
    - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # HCV: stable, viral load undetectable
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed minimal ascites
   - dobhoff placed yesterday, starting nutrition; will have to follow up
   long term nutrition plans
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   - cyro levels pending
   .
   # Corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis
 opthamology following;
   - tx with lacrilube ointment q 1hr, lacrilube drops q2 hr and cipro
   gtts q 6hrs
   - at risk for worsening corneal damage in setting of muscle weakness
   and inability to close eyes; will need close eye care for now and
   follow up with opthomology
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, requiring less and less medicine
   - starting tube feeds now that dobhoff placed
   - transitioned back to nadolol for varicies; can titrate up as needed
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - dobhoff in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab  - negative
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - nadolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - on tube feeds, stopping maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds started

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a complex medical history, including HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and a history of aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is on a tracheostomy with a trach mask trial and is receiving oxygen therapy at 50% FiO2.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function. There is no evidence of atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or aortic stenosis.
* Neurological: The patient has a mixed cryoglobulinemia-associated neuropathy and myopathy, which is suspected to be the primary cause of her weakness. She has a working diagnosis of an INF-related primary myopathy with an underlying secondary neuropathy related to cryoglobulinemia.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of dysphagia and laryngeal reflux, which is being managed with a nasogastric tube and proton pump inhibitors.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is being managed with platelet transfusions and holding all heparin products.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is receiving a 10-day course of cefepime.
* Endocrine: The patient has a history of HCV and is being managed with antiviral therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying neurological and muscular weakness.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild mitral regurgitation may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient's mixed cryoglobulinemia-associated neuropathy and myopathy may worsen, leading to further neurological decline.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of dysphagia and laryngeal reflux may lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Hematological complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
* Infectious complications: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and ongoing antiviral therapy may increase her risk of developing further infections.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Ongoing respiratory support with a tracheostomy and oxygen therapy
* Management of her neurological and muscular weakness with physical therapy and medications
* Gastrointestinal management with a nasogastric tube and proton pump inhibitors
* Hematological management with platelet transfusions and holding all heparin products
* Infectious disease management with a 10-day course of cefepime and ongoing antiviral therapy
* Endocrine management with antiviral therapy for HCV

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, last day today
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; continuing to
   improve, will do trach collar trial today
   - NIF is still -18 today
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult; plan for EMG and a nerve biopsy with neurosurg (Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 67**]
   - will follow up OSH biopsy, plan is to have specimen sent to [**Hospital1 **] after
   it is fixed
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed no ascites; question is
   now PEG v. dobhoff
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   - HCV virus and cyro levels pending
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - on maintenance fluids for now
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI; will switch from IV to PO nadolol when access to gut
   is achieved
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed; likely can be
   placed since no ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
 results pending
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement per liver recs, likely should
   have PEG to avoid two procedures as likely will need long term feeding
   options
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - PPI
   - no heparin problems
   .
   # Access:
   - RIJ from OSH removed, now with PIVs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a complex medical history, including HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness. She has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and aspiration, and is currently on a ventilator.

The patient has had several significant events in the past 24 hours, including the placement of a dopof tube, a sural nerve biopsy, and the administration of cipro eye drops for a significant corneal abrasion. She has also been started on metoprolol for heart rate control and cardioprotection in the setting of NSTEMI.

The patient's current medical condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 212 mL and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a heart rate of 87 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 153/103 mmHg. Her electrocardiogram shows no signs of ischemia.
* Neurological: The patient has mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy and a myopathic process in several proximal muscles, as seen on EMG. She also has a mild corneal abrasion.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has dysphagia and is NPO tonight. She is also experiencing laryngeal reflux.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 20's, and is at risk for bleeding.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient has resolving respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and aspiration, but is still on a ventilator.
* Neuromuscular weakness: The patient has mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy and a myopathic process in several proximal muscles, which is affecting her ability to wean from the ventilator.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 20's, which is below the normal range. She is at risk for bleeding and is being monitored closely.
* NSTEMI: The patient has a possible demand ischemia at OSH, which is being monitored with troponin and CK levels.
* Cryoglobulinemia: The patient has cryoglobulinemia, which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause vasculitis and neuropathy.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Ventilator weaning: The patient is being weaned from the ventilator, but is having difficulty due to her neuromuscular weakness.
* Antibiotics: The patient is on a 10-day course of cefepime for her pneumonia.
* Pain management: The patient is being managed with morphine for pain control.
* Electrolyte management: The patient is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances and is receiving maintenance fluids.
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving fiber source HN for nutrition and is being monitored for glycemic control.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute, and other comorbidities. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has undergone various interventions, including bronchoscopy, echocardiogram, and surgical procedures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/103 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a tracheal mask and ventilator, and is being administered various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing requirements for mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential need for invasive ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and blood cultures may indicate sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is uncertain due to the lack of assessment data. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration, including seizures, stroke, or spinal cord injury.
4. Cardiac Complications: The echocardiogram revealed mild mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may indicate underlying cardiac disease. There is a risk of further cardiac deterioration, including cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's altered nutrition and impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, or other complications.
6. Hematological Complications: The patient's low platelet count and elevated troponin levels may indicate bleeding or cardiac complications. There is a risk of further bleeding or cardiac dysfunction.
7. Infection: The patient's exposure to various medical devices and procedures increases the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, or surgical site infection.
8. Metabolic Complications: The patient's altered glucose and electrolyte levels may indicate metabolic derangement, which could lead to further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, or renal dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has undergone several procedures, including a bronchoscopy and a sural nerve biopsy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 153/103 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lung fields, regular heart rhythm, and normal abdominal and extremity examination. However, the patient has impaired motor function, with weakness in the upper and lower extremities, and is unable to squeeze eyes or move against gravity.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes and blood chemistry are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated troponin-T level.

The patient's diagnosis includes respiratory failure, acute malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, and myopathy. The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, lung injury, or respiratory muscle weakness.
2. Sepsis: The patient's impaired immune function and presence of central lines and indwelling catheters increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobility and presence of central lines increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and mortality.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and use of corticosteroids increase the risk of stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and mortality.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory failure and mortality.
6. Myopathy: The patient's myopathy may worsen, leading to further muscle weakness and impairment.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and mortality.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring, adjust therapy as needed, and consider further interventions to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - speech and swallow eval today, could not handle Passy-Muir valve yet,
   will try again on Friday
   - tachycardic in afternoon; appeared dry perhaps from autodiuresis with
   low K/Phos - given IVFs, tachycardia improved overnight
   - optho recs continued cipro gtts, spaced out lacrilube to q2 hrs,
   added erythromycin drops at night to L eye
   - neurosurg preop completed with type and screen, UA, CXR
   - waiting for OSH path prior to nerve biopsy, because if specimen is
   inadequate would like to do both muscle and nerve biopsy at the same
   time; plan would be for Monday if not tomorrow - need to touch base
   with both neuro and neurosurg today about finalized plan
   - aggitated overnight and slept very little, did not respond to
   morphine or ativan; can consider adding sleeping medicine tomorrow

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and myopathy. The patient has undergone several interventions, including speech and swallow evaluation, tachycardia management, and ophthalmology recommendations. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 157/91 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, low potassium and phosphorus levels, and elevated troponin-T levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and further deterioration could lead to worsening respiratory failure, ARDS, or other respiratory complications.
2. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's altered nutrition status and potential malnutrition could lead to further complications, such as muscle weakness, poor wound healing, and increased risk of infection.
3. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity could lead to further complications, such as pressure ulcers, wound infections, or skin breakdown.
4. Myopathy: The patient's myopathy could worsen, leading to further muscle weakness, decreased mobility, and increased risk of falls or other complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential cardiac stress could lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or myocardial infarction.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status remains uncertain, and further deterioration could lead to worsening neurological deficits, seizures, or other neurological complications.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and potential skin integrity issues could lead to infection, which could further complicate the patient's condition.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's altered nutrition status and potential gastrointestinal dysfunction could lead to further complications, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their critical medical conditions to prevent further complications and improve their chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - speech and swallow eval today, could not handle Passy-Muir valve yet,
   will try again on Friday
   - tachycardic in afternoon; appeared dry perhaps from autodiuresis with
   low K/Phos - given IVFs, tachycardia improved overnight
   - optho recs continued cipro gtts, spaced out lacrilube to q2 hrs,
   added erythromycin drops at night to L eye
   - neurosurg preop completed with type and screen, UA, CXR
   - waiting for OSH path prior to nerve biopsy, because if specimen is
   inadequate would like to do both muscle and nerve biopsy at the same
   time; plan would be for Monday if not tomorrow - need to touch base
   with both neuro and neurosurg today about finalized plan
   - aggitated overnight and slept very little, did not respond to
   morphine or ativan; can consider adding sleeping medicine tomorrow
   night like trazadone

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they are currently receiving respiratory support with a trach mask and oxygen therapy.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Tachycardia in the afternoon, which improved with IV fluids and resolved overnight
* Ophthalmology recommendations include continued ciprofloxacin eye drops, spaced out lacrilube, and added erythromycin drops at night to the left eye
* Neurosurgical preoperative evaluation was completed, including type and screen, urine analysis, and chest X-ray
* The patient is awaiting OSH path prior to nerve biopsy, which may be performed on Monday or Tuesday
* The patient was agitated overnight and slept poorly, with no response to morphine or ativan

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Normal white blood cell count (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) and troponin-T levels, indicating possible muscle damage
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) and lipase levels
* Normal electrolyte levels (K+, Phos, Na+, Cl-, CO2) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels
* Normal calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO4) levels

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure of 157/91 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, and their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is not specified.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): Elevated creatinine and BUN levels, potentially leading to renal replacement therapy
* Myopathy: Elevated CK and troponin-T levels, potentially leading to muscle weakness and dysfunction
* Sepsis: Elevated inflammatory markers and potential bacterial colonization, potentially leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Nutritional deficiencies: Potential malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, potentially leading to further complications
* Skin integrity issues: Potential pressure ulcers and skin breakdown, potentially leading to infection and further complications"

   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.  Working diagnosis is an INF
   related primary myopathy with an underlying secondary neuropathy
   related to cyroglobulemiia.  Neuro and neurosurg following
   - cryo levels pending
   - plan to review OSH muscle biopsies with neuro. OSH doctor is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
   call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - neuro would like to hold on nerve biopsy pending the muscle biopsy
   results; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 67**] is following and she is scheduled for OR today
   - appreciate neuro and neurosurg recs

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Completed course of cefepime on [**1-27**]. Given that her weakness preceeded
   her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - completed 10 day of cefepime on [**1-27**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - speech and swallow eval today, could not handle Passy-Muir valve yet,
   will try again on Friday
   - tachycardic in afternoon; appeared dry perhaps from autodiuresis with
   low K/Phos - given IVFs, tachycardia improved overnight
   - optho recs continued cipro gtts, spaced out lacrilube to q2 hrs,
   added erythromycin drops at night to L eye
   - neurosurg preop completed with type and screen, UA, CXR
   - waiting for OSH path prior to nerve biopsy, because if specimen is
   inadequate would like to do both muscle and nerve biopsy at the same
   time; plan would be for Monday if not tomorrow - need to touch base
   with both neuro and neurosurg today about finalized plan
   - aggitated overnight and slept very little, did not respond to
   morphine or ativan; can consider adding sleeping medicine tomorrow

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness. She is currently in the ICU following tracheostomy and intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has resolving respiratory failure from pneumonia/ARDS, and her difficulty weaning from the ventilator is presumptively due to neuromuscular weakness. She is currently on a tracheostomy trial and continues to receive nebulizers for her asthma.
* Neurological: The patient has a mixed cryoglobulinemia-associated myopathy and neuropathy, which is being evaluated with muscle and nerve biopsies. She is also experiencing tachycardia, which is likely related to pain and may be exacerbated by fluid overload.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has dysphagia and has failed a Passy-Muir valve trial. She is currently NPO and receiving tube feeds through a Dobhoff tube.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count in the 20s, and has been treated with heparin, which has been held due to concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). She is also being monitored for HIT antibodies.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and is being monitored for signs of ischemia. She is currently being treated with nadolol for tachycardia.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. She is also at risk for worsening corneal damage due to her muscle weakness and inability to close her eyes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to prolonged ventilation and increased risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Neurological decline: The patient's neuromuscular weakness can progress, leading to further respiratory and gastrointestinal compromise.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's dysphagia and thrombocytopenia increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and tachycardia increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines and tubes increase her risk of infection, including sepsis and pneumonia.
* Corneal damage: The patient's muscle weakness and inability to close her eyes increase her risk of worsening corneal damage, which can lead to blindness.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and addressing any concerns or issues promptly to prevent further deterioration and improve her overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.  Working diagnosis is an INF
   related primary myopathy with an underlying secondary neuropathy
   related to cyroglobulemiia.  Neuro and neurosurg following
   - cryo levels pending
   - plan to review OSH muscle biopsies with neuro. OSH doctor is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
   call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - neuro would like to hold on nerve biopsy pending the muscle biopsy
   results
   - nsurg aware of plan
   - appreciate neuro and neurosurg recs
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Completed course of cefepime on [**1-27**]. Given that her weakness preceeded
   her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - completed 10 day of cefepime on [**1-27**]
   - doing well on trach mask trial
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # HCV: stable, viral load undetectable
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed minimal ascites
   - dobhoff placed, starting nutrition; will have to follow up long term
   nutrition plans
   - holding INF as it may be possible cause of weakness
   - cryo levels pending

   # Corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis
 opthamology following;
   - tx with lacrilube ointment q 1hr, lacrilube drops q2 hr and cipro
   gtts q 6hrs
   - at risk for worsening corneal damage in setting of muscle weakness
   and inability to close eyes; will need close eye care for now and
   follow up with ophthalmology
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, requiring less and less medicine
   - starting tube feeds now that dobhoff placed
   - transitioned back to nadolol for varices; titrate up to 40mg [**1-29**]
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.  Failed PMV trial [**1-28**] [**1-11**]
   coughing/secretions.
   - continue PMV trials
   - NPO
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - dobhoff in place

   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab  - negative

   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - nadolol as above for tachycardia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - speech and swallow eval today, could not handle Passy-Muir valve yet,
   will try again on Friday
   - tachycardic in afternoon; appeared dry perhaps from autodiuresis with
   low K/Phos - given IVFs, tachycardia improved overnight
   - optho recs continued cipro gtts, spaced out lacrilube to q2 hrs,
   added erythromycin drops at night to L eye
   - neurosurg preop completed with type and screen, UA, CXR
   - waiting for OSH path prior to nerve biopsy, because if specimen is
   inadequate would like to do both muscle and nerve biopsy at the same
   time; plan would be for Monday if not tomorrow - need to touch base
   with both neuro and neurosurg today about finalized plan
   - aggitated overnight and slept very little, did not respond to
   morphine or ativan; can consider adding sleeping medicine tomorrow
   night like trazadone

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She has resolving respiratory failure from pneumonia/ARDS, and is now on a trach mask trial.
* Neurological: She has neuromuscular weakness, which is suspected to be related to cryoglobulinemia.
* Gastrointestinal: She has dysphagia and is NPO, with a dobbhoff tube in place for nutrition.
* Hematological: She has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 20's, and is being transfused for platelet counts <20.
* Cardiovascular: She has a history of NSTEMI, but current EKGs are normal, and she is being held on aspirin.
* Infectious: She has a history of pneumonia and is currently on ciprofloxacin gtts.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require further respiratory support.
* Neuromuscular weakness: The patient's weakness is suspected to be related to cryoglobulinemia, and further evaluation and treatment are needed.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is still low, and she may require further transfusions.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's dysphagia and inability to close her eyes make her at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis: The patient's eye condition is still unstable, and she may require further treatment and close eye care.
* Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is still present, and further evaluation and treatment are needed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued respiratory support with a trach mask trial
* Further evaluation and treatment of neuromuscular weakness
* Transfusion of platelets for thrombocytopenia
* Monitoring of gastrointestinal bleeding
* Further treatment and close eye care for corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis
* Monitoring of tachycardia and further evaluation and treatment as needed.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to the floor if she can receive adequate eye treatment."
