You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 81-year-old man, is critically ill with a constellation of worsening medical problems. He has a new diagnosis of HIV, C. difficile with leukocytosis, adrenal insufficiency, worsening acidosis and renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and L leg pain and erythema. He is on multiple medications, including steroids for adrenal insufficiency, Flagyl for C. difficile, and vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl for septic shock. His vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/unknown mmHg. He has tachypnea, abdominal pain, and LLE pain. His laboratory results show acute renal failure, sepsis, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's prognosis for renal recovery is poor, and further deterioration of his renal function can lead to life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction can lead to multi-organ failure and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency can lead to adrenal crisis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly and effectively.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis can lead to severe colitis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly and effectively.
5. HIV/AIDS: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV/AIDS can lead to opportunistic infections and cancers if not managed promptly and effectively.
6. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock can lead to cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
7. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications if not managed promptly and effectively.
8. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can lead to skin breakdown, wound infections, and sepsis if not managed promptly and effectively.
9. L leg pain and erythema: The patient's L leg pain and erythema can lead to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis if not managed promptly and effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Hypotension
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a complex medical condition, including HIV, C. diff, adrenal insufficiency, MDS, worsening acidosis, and renal failure due to ATN. He is critically ill and has a grim prognosis. The patient is experiencing hypotension, tachypnea, and abdominal pain. He has a history of allergies to antibiotics and is currently receiving norepinephrine, omeprazole, morphine sulfate, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his lab results show signs of worsening renal failure and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lab results show signs of sepsis, including leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and organ dysfunction. If left untreated, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he is at risk for further decline. If not addressed, renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
3. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis is worsening, and if not managed, can lead to further organ dysfunction and death.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further adrenal crisis. If not managed, adrenal insufficiency can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.
5. C. diff: The patient's C. diff infection is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further complications, including sepsis and death.
6. HIV: The patient's HIV is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further immune suppression and opportunistic infections.
7. MDS: The patient's MDS is not well-controlled, and he is at risk for further bone marrow suppression and infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acidosis and renal failure with supportive care and medications.
4. Consult with an endocrinologist to optimize the patient's adrenal insufficiency management.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as an intensive care unit, for further management.
6. Consult with an infectious disease specialist to optimize the patient's HIV and C. diff management.
7. Consider referring the patient to a hematologist for further management of his MDS."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Poss
   2) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  It would be strange for patient to continue
   to have no response to antibiotics after this prolonged course.  Would
   be concerned for other sources of diarrhea versus hypogammoglobulinemia
   as cause of continued infection.   Given HIV concerned for other causes
   of chronic diarrhea like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too
   high for [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   -Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - stool samples for O&P, isospora, crypto
   - OSH records
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient is receiving treatment for his various conditions, including antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, hypothermia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure and death.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient's continued diarrhea and lack of response to antibiotics suggest that C. difficile colitis may not be fully treated, which could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening infections.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's unclear etiology of worsening renal function could lead to further deterioration of his renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's persistent low platelet count could lead to bleeding complications, potentially life-threatening.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's unclear adrenal function could lead to further hypotension and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis could lead to further complications, potentially requiring invasive interventions.
7. MDS: The patient's myelodysplastic syndrome could lead to further cytopenias and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. HIV: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV could lead to further complications, potentially life-threatening, if not managed properly.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   9)FEN - gentle D5 w/ 3 amps bicarb / replete lytes prn / diabetic diet
   10)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   11) ACCESS

   12) CONTACT - patient, son

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated with bandemia, and they have a history of C. difficile infection. The patient is also hypotensive, which may be due to sepsis.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, and their cortisol levels are not well-controlled. They are also receiving steroids, which may be contributing to the adrenal insufficiency.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to sepsis, HIV, or MDS.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and they have granular casts in their urine, which may indicate acute tubular necrosis.
5. MDS: The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which may be contributing to their thrombocytopenia and anemia.
6. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which may be contributing to their immune suppression and increased risk of infection.
7. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which may be contributing to their diarrhea and abdominal pain.
8. DVT: The patient has a diagnosis of DVT, which may be contributing to their leg swelling and tenderness.
9. Anion Gap and Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which may be due to lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or other metabolic disorders.
10. Ischemic Etiologies: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which may indicate ischemic etiologies such as mesenteric ischemia or sepsis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis
* Vancomycin for C. difficile colitis
* IV flagyl for C. difficile colitis
* Dexamethasone for adrenal insufficiency
* Supportive care for MDS
* HIV testing and treatment as needed
* Monitoring for DVT and ischemic etiologies
* Management of anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
* Monitoring for acute renal failure and adjusting treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct?
   -RUQ Doppler to r/o thrombus.  LFts are . . .
   5) Acute Renal Failure: Dense ATN likely in setting of persistent
   hypotension.  Anuric poor prognosis.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which was treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. He also has a diagnosis of left leg swelling and tenderness, which is suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and hypothermia, which is consistent with sepsis. He also has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and hypothermia suggest sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient's history of C. difficile colitis and persistent diarrhea may lead to further complications, such as colon perforation and sepsis.
3. DVT: The patient's left leg swelling and tenderness suggest DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency and persistent hypotension may lead to further complications, such as adrenal crisis and death.
5. MDS: The patient's diagnosis of MDS may lead to further complications, such as bone marrow failure and increased risk of infections.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and death.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to further complications, such as bleeding and death.
8. Hepatic infarct: The patient's elevated lactate level and abdominal CT findings suggest the possibility of hepatic infarct, which can lead to further complications, such as liver failure and death.
9. Anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess the severity of his illness and response to treatment.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic therapy based on the results of his culture data and the possibility of C. difficile colitis.
3. Consider anticoagulation therapy for the patient's DVT.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist to assess the patient's risk of sepsis and to develop a plan for further management.
6. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to assess the patient's acute kidney injury and to develop a plan for further management.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to assess the patient's C. difficile colitis and to develop a plan for further management.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and consider consulting with a hepatologist if necessary.
9. Consider consulting with an endocrinologist to assess the patient's adrenal insufficiency and to develop a plan for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Hydration today (can give NS 150 ccs/hr) for potential
   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO
   except meds for bowel rest.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS
 L IJ
   15) CONTACT - patient, son

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -abdominal CT read: notable for hyperdensity/wedge shaped area in liver
   3X 4 cm ? infarct.   Pancreas unremarkable.  Sigmoid colon shows some
   edematous/inflammatory changes which could be consistent with his c
   diff colitis hx.
   -ABG was good: 7.43, 23, 90
   -Started vanc + cefepime for broad spectrum coverage of unknown source
   for sepsis.  Continuing IV vanc + PO vanc + IV metronidazole for C
   diff.  WBC still very high.  On levophed for pressor support
   -HCT drop from 30 -> 23, stable in PM.  Evening HCT showed . . .
   -Left leg looked swollen w/ some warmth and tenderness, lower extremity
   doppler obtained which showed presence of clot in superficial femoral
   vein (still a DVT); also appears to have erythema behind left knee and
   along left thigh/groin
   -amylase and lipase showed . . .
   -renal recs:  renal failure prob secondary to ATN in setting of
   hypotension.  Oliguric; so probably will take long time for kidney to
   recover.  Feel prognosis for kidney not good.
   -cycled cardiac enzymes which were 0.04, 0.05, 0.05
   -lactate trending down
   -Given stable HCTs, started on IV heparin

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who has been admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and suspected C. difficile colitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's elevated WBC count, bandemia, and hypothermia, there is a high risk of septic shock.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is anuric, which suggests AKI. The prognosis for kidney recovery is poor.
3. Liver Infarct: The abdominal CT scan reveals a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct, which could lead to liver failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to MDS, HAART therapy, or sepsis.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated, which could indicate pancreatitis.
6. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: Given the patient's sepsis, there is a risk of organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and hepatic dysfunction.
7. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and the abdominal CT scan shows evidence of sigmoiditis, which could lead to further complications.
8. DVT: The patient has a DVT in the superficial femoral vein, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or other complications.
9. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, and the note suggests that he may not be compliant with his medication regimen, which could lead to further complications.
10. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could be secondary to lactic acid accumulation or hypoaldosteronism.

To address these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and management of his sepsis, AKI, liver function, and other comorbidities. He will also require ongoing treatment for his C. difficile colitis, pancreatitis, and adrenal insufficiency."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)

   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Hydration today (can give NS 150 ccs/hr) for potential
   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO
   except meds for bowel rest.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, admitted to the ICU for hypotension. He has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, and his abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area in the liver consistent with infarct. He also has a DVT in the superficial femoral vein, and his labs show elevated amylase and lipase levels, suggestive of pancreatitis. His renal function is impaired, and he has an anion gap metabolic acidosis. He is also thrombocytopenic and has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, hypothermia, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which could be caused by C. difficile colitis, pneumonia, or another source.
2. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area in the liver consistent with infarct, which could be caused by embolic event or hypercoagulability.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, which could be caused by gallstones, trauma, or other factors.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and anuria suggest acute renal failure, which could be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or other factors.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could be caused by MDS, HAART therapy, or sepsis.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hyponatremia and hyperkalemia suggest adrenal insufficiency, which could be caused by recent discontinuation of dexamethasone or other factors.
7. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate levels suggest lactic acidosis, which could be caused by sepsis, hypotension, or other factors.
8. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis could lead to further complications, such as sepsis, perforation, or toxic megacolon.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue to monitor his vital signs, labs, and clinical status closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical condition, including septic shock, C. Diff colitis, liver lesion, DVT, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 110/ unknown mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 51 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 94%
* WBC: 42.8 K/uL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to uncontrolled infection.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
3. Liver lesion: The patient has a wedge-shaped lesion in the liver, which may be a sign of liver infarction or metastatic disease.
4. DVT: The patient has a DVT in the left superficial femoral artery, which may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase and amylase levels, suggesting possible pancreatitis.
6. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which may require antiretroviral therapy and monitoring.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is receiving dexamethasone for adrenal insufficiency, which may require close monitoring.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: Cefipime, vancomycin, and metronidazole for septic shock and C. Diff colitis.
2. Heparin: For DVT prophylaxis and treatment.
3. Vasopressors: Norepinephrine for septic shock.
4. Renal replacement therapy: The patient may require dialysis due to acute renal failure.
5. Pain management: The patient is receiving morphine for pain control.
6. Gastrointestinal support: The patient is receiving IV fluids and electrolytes for hydration and electrolyte management.
7. HIV management: The patient's HIV status will require monitoring and treatment, including antiretroviral therapy.

The patient's overall prognosis is poor due to the severity of his condition and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction. The patient's family should be informed of the poor prognosis and the need for further treatment and management."

 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - f/u hemolysis labs
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Fluid boluses. NPO until NG lavage.  Replenish electrolytes
   (calcium was low this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS
 L IJ
   15) CONTACT - patient, son
   16 )CODE - FULL
   17) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and acute renal failure. He has a history of C. difficile colitis, which was treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. He also has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in his left leg, which is causing erythema and edema. He has a tender and erythematous skin lesion along his left groin/thigh and behind his left knee, which could be secondary to skin infection or cellulitis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count with bandemia, hypothermia, and elevated lactate. His creatinine is elevated, and he has an anion gap acidosis. He also has thrombocytopenia and is at risk for bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count with bandemia and hypothermia suggest that he may be at risk for sepsis.
2. DVT: The patient's DVT in his left leg could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient's history of C. difficile colitis could lead to further complications, such as perforation or abscesses.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency could lead to further complications, such as hypotension or adrenal crisis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances or acidosis.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could lead to bleeding complications.
7. MDS: The patient's MDS could lead to further complications, such as bleeding or infection.
8. HIV: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV could lead to further complications, such as opportunistic infections or malignancies.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results to assess for signs of sepsis, DVT, C. difficile colitis, adrenal insufficiency, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, MDS, and HIV.
2. Continue to treat the patient's C. difficile colitis with vancomycin and metronidazole.
3. Consider consulting an infectious disease specialist to further evaluate and treat the patient's sepsis and C. difficile colitis.
4. Consider consulting a hematologist to further evaluate and treat the patient's MDS.
5. Consider consulting a pulmonologist to further evaluate and treat the patient's respiratory failure.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and electrolyte balance to prevent further complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if necessary.
8. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist to further evaluate and treat the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 likely flash pulmonary edema,
   given chronicity with fluids.  Given 100 mg IV Lasix with poor UOP.
   Will follow and reassess.  Curretnly 100% on CPAP.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, d/c heparin, start argatroban
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable state ( wedge shaped liver
   lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   8) HIV

   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 likely flash pulmonary edema,
   given chronicity with fluids.  Given 100 mg IV Lasix with poor UOP.
   Will follow and reassess.  Curretnly 100% on CPAP.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, d/c heparin, start argatroban
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable state ( wedge shaped liver
   lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - NPO until NG lavage.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS
 L IJ
   15) CONTACT - patient, son
   16 )CODE - FULL
   17) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of MDS and is at risk for hypercoagulability. The presence of a DVT in the left leg and possible pulmonary embolism requires close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count with bandemia, which suggests sepsis. The presence of erythematous skin lesions and prepatellar fluid and edema around the left knee may indicate a skin infection or cellulitis.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is anuric, which suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to persistent hypotension. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid management is necessary.
4. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan reveals a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to an infarct. This requires further evaluation and management.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated, but there are no clinical signs of pancreatitis. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
6. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may be secondary to lactic acid accumulation and renal failure. Close monitoring of acid-base status and renal function is necessary.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency is unclear, and his cortisol levels are low. Further evaluation and management are necessary to ensure adequate cortisol replacement.
8. HIV: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV requires close monitoring and antiretroviral therapy. His CD4 count is 250, which is relatively high, and his viral load is unknown.
9. MDS: The patient's diagnosis of MDS requires close monitoring and transfusion support.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be secondary to his MDS or sepsis. Close monitoring of platelet count and transfusion support are necessary.
11. Skin Infections: The patient's skin lesions and prepatellar fluid and edema around the left knee may indicate a skin infection or cellulitis. Close monitoring and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
12. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and oxygen therapy.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications to prevent further deterioration of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, C. Diff, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, and worsening renal failure. He has developed anuria, acidosis, and hypoxemia. The patient is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction, and is being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory compromise, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing further sepsis complications, including organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in his lower extremity, which increases his risk of developing pulmonary embolism and other complications.
5. C. Difficile-Associated Diarrhea: The patient has C. difficile infection, which increases his risk of developing further complications, including colitis and sepsis.
6. HIV-Associated Complications: The patient has HIV, which increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections and other complications.
7. Liver Lesion: The patient has a wedge-shaped liver lesion, which may be a sign of liver infarction or metastatic disease.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is worsening, and he is at risk of developing further complications, including heart failure and decreased tissue oxygenation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
2. Consider further interventions to improve the patient's respiratory function, such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis, including administration of antibiotics and source control measures.
4. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent further DVT complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's C. difficile infection and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's liver lesion, including imaging studies and liver function tests.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
8. Consider further evaluation of the patient's HIV status, including CD4 count and viral load testing."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a complex medical condition, including shock, renal failure, and respiratory failure. He has a new diagnosis of HIV, C. difficile (C. Diff), and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is experiencing worsening renal failure and acidosis, hypoxemia, and anuria. The patient is receiving treatment for septic shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, C. Diff, and DVT. He has a liver lesion that is being evaluated, and he has received transfusions for anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening sepsis could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening conditions like uremic syndrome.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure could lead to further complications, such as respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and potentially life-threatening conditions like respiratory failure.
4. DVT: The patient's lower extremity DVT could lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and potentially life-threatening conditions like pulmonary embolism.
5. Liver Lesion: The patient's liver lesion could lead to further complications, such as liver failure, liver abscess, and potentially life-threatening conditions like liver failure.
6. HIV: The patient's HIV infection could lead to further complications, such as opportunistic infections, immune suppression, and potentially life-threatening conditions like AIDS.
7. C. Diff: The patient's C. Diff infection could lead to further complications, such as diarrhea, dehydration, and potentially life-threatening conditions like septicemia.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening conditions like cardiac failure.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications due to his complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic
   acidosis.  oxygenating well.
   - evluate for pulm edema - ECHO pending, not responding to lasix, but
   also not makign significant urine.
   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis - - line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - d/c IV flagyl and po vanco given neg Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT
   #).  Thrombocytopenia
 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Obtain OSH records
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody pending
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Stable at 29-30 since.
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - PM Hct stable
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - Hemolysis labs: Elevated LDH and Tbili, normal hapto, no shistocytes
   -> low probability of hemolysis
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   - line placement likely today, will have to hold argatroban.  Give FFP
   and platelets.  ?Plt shortage.
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   - VL/CD4 pending.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Cdiff negative
   - f/u O&P
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.   RUQ u/s: Patent
   and appropriate hepatic vasculature, No gallstones and no signs of
   cholecystitis.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.  RUQ
   US clear.
   - no need to follow lipase and amylase
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   #) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure.  (Initially also
   due to lactic acid which has now improved)
   - f/u renal recs
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   #) ACCESS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and hypercoagulability.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to acute hypotensive insult to the kidneys.
4. Hepatic infarct or ischemic hepatitis due to possible embolic event or hypercoagulability.
5. Chronic diarrhea due to C. difficile colitis, HIV, or other underlying conditions.
6. Adrenal crisis due to possible non-compliance with dexamethasone therapy.
7. Anion gap acidosis due to metabolic acidosis and renal failure.
8. Thrombocytopenia due to MDS, sepsis, or HAART therapy.
9. Potential bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and elevated INR.
10. Skin integrity issues due to prolonged ICU stay and possible sepsis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support to maintain oxygenation.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible infections.
3. Anticoagulation therapy with argatroban to prevent further thrombosis.
4. Renal replacement therapy to manage acute renal failure.
5. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
6. Transfusion of blood products to manage anemia and thrombocytopenia.
7. Monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation studies to assess liver and coagulation function.

The patient's family has requested dialysis, which may be considered once the patient's coagulation profile is stabilized. The patient's son is the primary historian, and it is unclear if he is aware of the patient's risk factors for HIV and other conditions."

   hypertrophied. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic
   acidosis.  oxygenating well.
   - evluate for pulm edema
 ECHO unremarkable, not responding to lasix,
   but also not makign significant urine.
   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis -  line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT
   #).  Thrombocytopenia
 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - [**Hospital1 **]  coags and platelets
   -Obtain OSH records
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody pending
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Stable at 29-30 since.
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - PM Hct stable
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - Hemolysis labs: Elevated LDH and Tbili, normal hapto, no shistocytes
   -> low probability of hemolysis
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   - line placement likely today, will have to hold argatroban.  Give FFP
   and platelets.  ?Plt shortage.
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   - VL/CD4 pending.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - repeat Cdiff tox
   - f/u O&P
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.   RUQ u/s: Patent
   and appropriate hepatic vasculature, No gallstones and no signs of
   cholecystitis.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.  RUQ
   US clear.
   - no need to follow lipase and amylase
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   #) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure.  (Initially also
   due to lactic acid which has now improved)
   - f/u renal recs
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic

   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis -  line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.

   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT

 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension. He is currently requiring respiratory support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation due to acute respiratory decompensation. The patient has multiple medical issues, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute pain, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's CXR shows RLL opacity, which could be indicative of pulmonary edema.
2. Atelectasis/Lung Collapse: The patient's CXR also shows RLL opacity, which could be indicative of atelectasis or lung collapse.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows RLL opacity, which could be indicative of pneumonia.
4. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): Given the patient's DVT and hypercoagulable state, PE is a potential complication.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is anuric, which could be indicative of acute renal failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he has a fever, which could be indicative of sepsis.
7. DVT: The patient has a DVT in the superficial femoral vein, which could lead to further complications.
8. HIT (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia): Given the patient's platelet count and INR, HIT is a potential complication.
9. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is anuric, which could be indicative of AKI.
10. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's abdominal CT shows a wedge-shaped area on the liver, which could be indicative of a hepatic infarct.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his multiple medical issues. He needs to be treated for his respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. He also needs to be evaluated for potential complications, such as pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, pneumonia, and PE. The patient's DVT and potential HIT need to be managed, and his platelet count and INR need to be monitored closely. His renal function needs to be closely monitored, and he needs to be evaluated for potential complications, such as AKI and hepatic infarct."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is experiencing Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern, which is a sign of respiratory failure. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) and has a SpO2 of 100%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypotension, with a blood pressure of 110/unknown mmHg, and is receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine.
* Renal status: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, and is anuric.
* Neurological status: The patient is encephalopathic, unable to provide a history, and has a language barrier.
* Hematological status: The patient has a low platelet count (25-32 x 10^9/L) and is at risk of bleeding.
* Infectious status: The patient has a diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) and is receiving antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and metronidazole.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his lower extremities, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and is at risk of sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and organ dysfunction make him at high risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
* Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and anticoagulation therapy with argatroban make him at risk for bleeding complications.
* Renal failure: The patient's anuria and worsening renal function make him at risk for further deterioration of his renal function, potentially requiring dialysis.
* Liver failure: The patient's liver lesion and elevated liver enzymes suggest the possibility of liver failure, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor support make him at risk for cardiovascular instability, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the ICU team should continue to closely monitor his vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory values, and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the MICU with hypotension, acute respiratory decompensation, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with potential causes including sepsis, hypovolemia, and adrenal insufficiency. He is currently receiving respiratory support with ASSIST and FiO2 40%, and his oxygenation is adequate. The patient's platelet count is falling, and he is receiving platelet transfusions. His hematocrit is dropping, and he is receiving transfusions. He has acute renal failure, and his creatinine is rising. He is also experiencing diarrhea, and a CT scan shows evidence of sigmoiditis. The patient's abdominal CT also reveals a wedge-shaped area on the liver, which could be secondary to a hepatic infarct.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, bandemia, and hypothermia suggest sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including pneumonia, cellulitis, or sigmoiditis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is falling, and he is at risk for bleeding. The differential diagnosis includes DIC, worsening HIV infection, hep C-induced thrombocytopenia, ITP, TTP, and HIT.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine is rising, and he is anuric. The etiology is likely ATN, but other possibilities include hep C-related vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
4. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's abdominal CT shows a wedge-shaped area on the liver, which could be secondary to a hepatic infarct.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history is unclear, but he may be experiencing adrenal insufficiency, which could be exacerbated by his septic shock.
6. MDS: The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which could be contributing to his anemia and thrombocytopenia.
7. HIV: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV is unusual in an 80-year-old male, and he may be at risk for opportunistic infections.
8. C. Difficile Colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which could be contributing to his diarrhea and abdominal pain.
9. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, which could be contributing to his liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia.

Plan:

1. Continue respiratory support with ASSIST and FiO2 40%.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse as necessary.
3. Continue IV fluids and electrolyte replacement.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine and adjust his fluid management accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   -F/u smear
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   -F/u smear
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute respiratory decompensation, and acute kidney injury. He has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, and his platelet count has dropped significantly. He is currently receiving respiratory support, vasopressors, and antibiotics. His laboratory results show elevated D-dimer, low CD4 count, and high levels of HIV RNA.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he requires ongoing respiratory support. Pneumonia, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema are possible causes of his respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, bandemia, and hypothermia suggest sepsis. The source of the sepsis is unclear, but it may be related to the patient's C. difficile colitis, HIV infection, or other underlying conditions.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, and he has received platelet transfusions. DIC, HIV-related thrombocytopenia, and ITP are possible causes of his thrombocytopenia.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and he is anuric. ATN and hep-C related vasculitis are possible causes of his acute kidney injury.
5. Hepatic infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct. Hypercoagulability and liver disease are possible causes of this finding.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency is unclear, but he may require stress dose steroids.
7. Mental status change: The patient's mental status has changed, and he may have had an ischemic or embolic event, or an adverse reaction to sedation.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stool guaiac test is positive, and he may have gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state and underlying conditions.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he may require ongoing vasopressor support.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue respiratory support and adjust as needed.
2. Manage sepsis with antibiotics and fluids, and consider additional therapies such as vasopressors and corticosteroids.
3. Monitor and manage thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions and consider additional therapies such as IVIG and steroids.
4. Continue to monitor and manage acute kidney injury with dialysis and fluids, and consider additional therapies such as IV antibiotics and vasopressors.
5. Monitor and manage hepatic infarct with laboratory tests and imaging studies, and consider additional therapies such as anticoagulation and supportive care.
6. Monitor and manage adrenal insufficiency with stress dose steroids and consider additional therapies such as hydrocortisone.
7. Monitor and manage mental status change with sedation and consider additional therapies such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants.
8. Monitor and manage gastrointestinal bleeding with endoscopy and consider additional therapies such as vasopressin and octreotide.
9. Monitor and manage infection with antibiotics and consider additional therapies such as antivirals and antifungals.
10. Monitor and manage cardiovascular instability with vasopressors and consider additional therapies such as inotropes and vasodilators."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a critically ill 81-year-old man with multiple organ system failures. The patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, but the current respiratory failure is not attributed to ARDS.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and CRRT has been initiated. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient has anuria.
3. Septic shock: The patient has hypotension and is receiving vasopressors. The patient has a severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
4. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a lower extremity DVT, which is being treated with heparin.
5. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, and antiretroviral therapy has been discontinued.
6. C. difficile (C. diff): The patient has a diagnosis of C. diff, and treatment with vancomycin and metronidazole has been initiated.
7. Liver lesion: The patient has a liver lesion, and a RUQ ultrasound has been ordered.
8. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, and the causes are being investigated, including DIC, hemolysis, and bone marrow biopsy.
9. Acidosis: The patient has acidosis, which is being managed with bicarbonate therapy.
10. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise from these conditions include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory function, leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Progression of renal failure, leading to end-stage renal disease.
3. Development of multi-organ failure, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
4. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, leading to cardiac arrest.
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to pancytopenia and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression and indwelling lines.
7. Development of liver failure, leading to coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
8. Development of pancreatitis, leading to further organ dysfunction.
9. Development of septic shock, leading to cardiac arrest and multi-organ failure.

The patient's family has been informed of the patient's poor prognosis and has changed the patient's code status to DNR. The patient's care plan includes ongoing management of mechanical ventilation, CRRT, and septic shock, as well as treatment of C. diff and HIV. The patient's pancytopenia and liver lesion require further investigation and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Altered mental status
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Deep vein thrombosis, lower extremity
* Acute pain
* Impaired skin integrity
* Renal failure, acute
* Sepsis, severe

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing vancomycin and cefepime for septic shock
* Treating C. Diff with oral vancomycin and IV flagyl
* Starting stress dose steroids
* Continuing pressors
* Increasing PEEP for hypoxemic respiratory failure
* Planning for bronchoscopy
* Starting acyclovir for emerging vesicular rash
* Discussing ID consult for HIV
* Starting dapsone and azithromycin for HIV prophylaxis
* Ordering RUQ ultrasound for liver lesion
* Continuing CRRT for renal failure
* Checking for DIC, hemolysis labs, and cryo, complement, and ANCA for pancytopenia
* Referring to renal team for further management

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function
* Worsening of septic shock
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Progression of C. Diff colitis
* Extension of DVT to the pulmonary circulation
* Development of bleeding diathesis due to pancytopenia
* Progression of liver lesion
* Development of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease
* Development of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy, but still at risk for respiratory failure due to volume overload and altered mental status.
* Cardiovascular status: hypotensive, but improving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated blood pressures. The patient has a DVT in the superficial femoral vein and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
* Renal status: anuric, with acute renal failure possibly caused by ATN, hep-C related vasculitis, or other etiologies.
* Hematological status: thrombocytopenia, possibly due to DIC, drug reaction, HAART therapy, or Hep-C induced.
* Neurological status: altered mental status, possibly due to hypoxia, TTP, ischemic/embolic event, or effects of sedation.
* Gastrointestinal status: C. difficile colitis, with a history of treatment with vancomycin and metronidazole.
* Hepatic status: possible hepatic infarct or tumor, with normal liver function tests and mildly elevated INR.
* Adrenal status: unclear history of adrenal insufficiency, with a recent diagnosis and treatment with stress dose steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is at risk due to volume overload and altered mental status, which can lead to further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: the patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to his underlying conditions, such as HIV and MDS, and the presence of a DVT.
3. Thrombotic events: the patient has a DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, stroke, or other complications.
4. Renal failure: the patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: the patient's thrombocytopenia and possible DIC make him at risk for hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the GI tract or other sites.
6. Neurological complications: the patient's altered mental status and possible TTP or ischemic/embolic event make him at risk for further neurological deterioration.
7. Hepatic complications: the patient's possible hepatic infarct or tumor can lead to further liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: the patient's unclear history of adrenal insufficiency and recent treatment with stress dose steroids make him at risk for further adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension and other complications.

In summary, this patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - F/u sputum cxs; BAL - PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6261**] pending
   - On CVVH - net even over last several hours given icnreasing pressor
   support
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Continue CVVH
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count with bandemia, which is a strong indicator of sepsis. The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels also support the diagnosis of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has remained stable, but the patient is still at risk for further deterioration due to the underlying lung disease and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient is anuric, which indicates AKI. The patient's underlying liver disease and HIV infection may also contribute to the development of AKI.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or other underlying conditions.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in the superficial femoral vein, which may be provoked or unprovoked.
6. Hepatic infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan reveals a wedge-shaped area on the liver that may be secondary to an infarct.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency is unclear, and the patient's cortisol levels are not mentioned in the note.
8. MDS: The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which may be contributing to the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.
9. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which may be contributing to the patient's diarrhea and abdominal pain.
10. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may be contributing to the development of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and other complications, such as lymphoma.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for developing further complications due to the underlying medical conditions, including sepsis, respiratory failure, AKI, thrombocytopenia, DVT, hepatic infarct, adrenal insufficiency, MDS, C. difficile colitis, and HIV-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a new diagnosis of HIV, C. Diff, and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). He is currently experiencing worsening renal failure, acidosis, hypoxemia, and anuria. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing altered mental status, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is requiring increasing doses of vasopressors. He has a high risk of developing septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to his C. Diff infection and the presence of DVT.
5. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's DVT is not being adequately treated, and he is at risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
6. HIV: The patient's HIV infection is not being well-controlled, and he is at risk of developing opportunistic infections.
7. C. Diff: The patient's C. Diff infection is not being adequately treated, and he is at risk of developing complications such as colitis and toxic megacolon.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not being well-controlled, and he is at risk of developing complications such as heart failure and poor wound healing.
9. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is not being well-controlled, and he is at risk of developing complications such as infection and bleeding.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Met with the son and daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname **] this evening.  We discussed
   the lack of recovery of renal function and the multi system organ
   failure despite aggressive measures.  I told them that I felt his
   prognosis was very poor.  Given this, they have decided to switch his
   goals of care to comfort measures, and are planning to withdraw
   mechanical ventilation and pressors in the morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill
   ------ Protected Section ------
   Met with the son and daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname **] this evening.  We discussed
   the lack of recovery of renal function and the multi system organ
   failure despite aggressive measures.  I told them that I felt his
   prognosis was very poor.  Given this, they have decided to switch his
   goals of care to comfort measures, and are planning to withdraw
   mechanical ventilation and pressors in the morning.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man with a diagnosis of HIV, C. Diff, LLE DVT, hypotension, and worsening renal failure and acidosis. He is critically ill with altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs are stable. He has a history of bronchoscopy and removal of a mucous plug from his right upper lobe, which was likely responsible for his prior respiratory failure. He is anuric and has a negative fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis with organ dysfunction is a major concern. He may develop further organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or cardiovascular collapse.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a significant concern, and he may require further interventions, such as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or dialysis.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is a concern, and he may be at risk for bleeding or infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's LLE DVT is a concern, and he may be at risk for further clotting or pulmonary embolism.
6. Sepsis-related shock: The patient's sepsis-related shock is a major concern, and he may require further interventions, such as vasopressors or inotropes.
7. Multi-organ failure: The patient's multi-organ failure is a significant concern, and he may require further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis.
8. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may lead to further complications, such as opportunistic infections or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
9. C. Diff-related complications: The patient's C. Diff infection may lead to further complications, such as bowel perforation or abscess formation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive management of the patient's sepsis, including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and vasopressors as needed.
2. Consider further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation, to improve the patient's respiratory status.
3. Continue CRRT or dialysis as needed to manage the patient's renal failure.
4. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and consider transfusion support as needed.
5. Consider further interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy or inferior vena cava filter placement, to manage the patient's LLE DVT.
6. Monitor the patient's sepsis-related shock and consider further interventions, such as vasopressors or inotropes, as needed.
7. Consider further interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis, to manage the patient's multi-organ failure.
8. Monitor the patient's HIV infection and consider further interventions, such as antiretroviral therapy or opportunistic infection prophylaxis, as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's C. Diff infection and consider further interventions, such as bowel rest or antibiotics, as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Blood urea nitrogen: 280 mg/dL
* Glucose: 327 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium: 133 mEq/L, potassium: 3.1 mEq/L, magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL, phosphorus: 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for HIV, MDS, adrenal insufficiency, and C. difficile infection. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

* Septic shock due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of C. difficile infection
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's mechanical ventilation and potential underlying lung disease
* Renal failure due to the patient's hypotension and underlying kidney disease
* Hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes and potential insulin resistance
* Adrenal insufficiency exacerbation due to the patient's underlying condition and potential medication interactions
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and dialysis catheter.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - DNR
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - DNR
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, acute respiratory decompensation, and sepsis. He has a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and anticoagulation therapy. His laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute renal failure. He also has a history of C. difficile colitis and is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by a bacterial infection, which is being treated with antibiotics. However, the source of the infection is unclear, and the patient's condition could worsen if the infection is not adequately treated.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a common complication of sepsis. The patient's platelet count is low, and he is at risk for bleeding.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is a common complication of sepsis. The patient's kidneys are not functioning adequately, and he is at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct. This could be a sign of liver damage, which could worsen the patient's condition.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency is likely caused by his history of adrenal insufficiency and his current septic shock. He is at risk for further adrenal insufficiency if his condition worsens.
6. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole, but the infection could worsen if the antibiotics are not effective.
7. MDS: The patient's MDS is likely causing his anemia and thrombocytopenia. He is at risk for further complications, such as bleeding and infections, if his MDS is not adequately managed.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further complications, including sepsis, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, hepatic infarct, adrenal insufficiency, C. difficile colitis, and MDS. His condition requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent these complications."
