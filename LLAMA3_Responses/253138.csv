   Assessment and Plan
   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.

   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone multiple doses of chemotherapy. The patient is currently in the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of DVTs, including bilateral lower extremity DVTs and right upper extremity DVT, and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. The patient is currently on enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, to prevent further DVTs.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 11.0 x 10^9/L, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 105 x 10^9/L. The patient's anion gap is 18, indicating metabolic anion gap acidosis, which may be secondary to lactic acidosis or increased cell death/turnover from recurrent lymphoma.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin and cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage
* Attempting to wean phenylephrine infusion
* Performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) to rule out malignant pericardial effusion or infection
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis, including fever and worsening hemodynamics
* Considering starting oral amiodarone to control atrial fibrillation
* Continuing enoxaparin at 60 mg subcutaneously daily
* Monitoring the patient's platelet count and transfusing if it falls below 50 x 10^9/L
* Following the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and transfusing if necessary
* Managing the patient's nausea and vomiting with medications such as reglan and zofran
* Continuing the patient's antacid regimen to manage gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a multi-lumen catheter inserted on May 26, 2027, at 02:19 PM. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and other complications. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's hypotension and the presence of sepsis, there is a risk of developing septic shock.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: Atrial fibrillation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which may worsen the patient's condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of developing respiratory failure, especially with the presence of atrial fibrillation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the presence of a multi-lumen catheter and other invasive devices.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of bleeding, especially with the presence of anticoagulants.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the presence of stress ulcer prophylaxis.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is at risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition, due to the presence of a multi-lumen catheter and other invasive devices.
10. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to the presence of a multi-lumen catheter and other invasive devices."

   61 year old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p multiple doses
   of chemotherapy with hospital course complicated by afib with RVR,
   hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with afib with RVR in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Has been recurrent since initial diagnosis of
   DLBCL per wife and did require ICU admission during last hospital
   course for similar reasons (hypotension, afib with RVR). Also has prior
   h/o malignant pericardial tamponade. Has not been diuresed for several
   days on the floor; however, pt with poor po intake and intravascular
   hypovolemia may be contributing. Other considerations for recurrent
   afib are possibility of infection, recurrent lymphoma involvement of
   pericardium, inability to tolerate consistent dosing of beta-blockers
   on the floor due to hypotension over the weekend, or PE with RV
   overload --> increased RA filling pressures. Doubt hyperthyroid state.
   Now back in NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, neo gtt.
   - Attempt to wean neo gtt. Pt and wife have declined further attempts
   at aline for now.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE.
   - Blood cxs peripherally and from central line.
   - Empiric abx coverage with IV vancomycin, cefepime for now.
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given hypotension.
   - Telemetry.
   - Consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   .
   # Hypotension - In setting of afib with RVR, poor po intake, possible
   sepsis although no fevers.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs as above, f/u cx data and narrow abxs as
   appropriate.
   - Wean off neo gtt as tolerated with IVF boluses as above.
   - TTE
   - No aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   .
   #. h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR) in the setting of hypotension. The patient has a history of recurrent afib, malignant pericardial tamponade, and bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Hypotension
* Leukocytosis (WBC count up to 11K)
* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 105K)
* Anemia (Hct 26.2%)
* Metabolic anion gap acidosis (AG 18)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Back pain
* GERD
* DVTs

The patient is being treated with:

* Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* IV fluids and vasopressors for hypotension
* Antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for suspected infection
* Enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis
* Pain management with methadone and reglan
* Antacid therapy for GERD
* Acyclovir, fluconazole, and pantoprazole for treatment of underlying conditions

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
* Hypotension and potential cardiovascular collapse
* Sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications
* Metabolic anion gap acidosis and lactic acidosis
* Nausea and vomiting with potential for aspiration
* Back pain and potential for spinal cord compression
* DVTs and potential for pulmonary embolism

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, s/p multiple doses
   of chemotherapy with hospital course complicated by afib with RVR,
   hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with afib with RVR in setting of hypotension.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation - Has been recurrent since initial diagnosis of
   DLBCL per wife and did require ICU admission during last hospital
   course for similar reasons (hypotension, afib with RVR). Also has prior
   h/o malignant pericardial tamponade. Has not been diuresed for several
   days on the floor; however, pt with poor po intake and intravascular
   hypovolemia may be contributing. Other considerations for recurrent
   afib are possibility of infection, recurrent lymphoma involvement of
   pericardium, inability to tolerate consistent dosing of beta-blockers
   on the floor due to hypotension over the weekend, or PE with RV
   overload --> increased RA filling pressures. Doubt hyperthyroid state.
   Now back in NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, neo gtt.
   - Attempt to wean neo gtt. Pt and wife have declined further attempts
   at aline for now.
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE.
   - Blood cxs peripherally and from central line.
   - Empiric abx coverage with IV vancomycin, cefepime for now.
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   - Hold metoprolol for now given hypotension.
   - Telemetry.
   - Consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   .
   # Hypotension - In setting of afib with RVR, poor po intake, possible
   sepsis although no fevers.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs as above, f/u cx data and narrow abxs as
   appropriate.
   - Wean off neo gtt as tolerated with IVF boluses as above.
   - TTE
   - No aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   .
   #. h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs
   .
   # ACCESS - Left IJ TLC placed by IR on [**2127-4-23**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, who has been admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypotension, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition is complicated by a history of malignant pericardial tamponade, recurrent AFib, and poor PO intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent AFib with RVR: The patient has a history of recurrent AFib, which can lead to hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and increased risk of stroke.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can worsen his condition and lead to organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
3. Upper extremity DVT: The patient has a known history of bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) and further complications.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, which can exacerbate his condition and lead to cardiac arrhythmias, kidney damage, and bone pain.
5. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: The patient's metabolic anion gap acidosis can worsen his condition and lead to further organ dysfunction.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis can be a sign of infection, stress reaction, or underlying lymphoma progression, which can worsen his condition.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase his risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of invasive procedures.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen his condition and lead to further organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver.

The patient's current medications include:

1. Vancomycin
2. Cefepime
3. Enoxaparin
4. Phenylephrine
5. Prochlorperazine
6. Lorazepam
7. Metoprolol (held due to hypotension)
8. Amiodarone (considered for PO administration)
9. Pantoprazole
10. Methadone
11. Zyprexa
12. Reglan
13. Zofran

The patient's laboratory results include:

1. WBC: 11.0 (normal range: 4.5-11.0)
2. Hct: 26.2 (normal range: 37-51)
3. Plt: 116 (normal range: 150-450)
4. Cr: 0.7 (normal range: 0.5-1.2)
5. TropT: 0.09 (normal range: 0-0.5)
6. Glucose: 67 (normal range: 70-100)
7. Lactic acid: 6.4 mmol/L (normal range: 0.5-2.0)
8. LDH: 474 IU/L (normal range: 140-280)
9. Ca++: 8.5 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.5)
10. Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL (normal range: 1.8-3.5)
11. PO4: 3.0 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.5)

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

1. Tachycardia (89 bpm)
2. Hypotension (114/67 mmHg)
3. Diminished right radial pulse
4. Presence of left radial and dorsal pedal pulses
5. Warm and dry skin
6. Oriented to person and place, but not date
7. Responds to verbal stimuli
8. Occasionally makes statements that do not make sense, appears delirious

The patient's current plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring for recurrent AFib with RVR and hypotension
2. Weaning off neo gtt as tolerated with IVF boluses
3. TTE to rule out RV strain
4. Check TTE and venous lactate levels
5. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and narrow antibiotics as appropriate
6. Monitor for worsening metabolic anion gap acidosis
7. Follow platelet count and transfuse for > 50K
8. Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ
9. Consider starting PO amiodarone in the morning
10. Telemetry monitoring"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has been receiving chemotherapy and has had multiple doses of vancomycin and cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage. He has also been receiving digoxin for rate control and phenylephrine for vasopressor support. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hypercalcemia, and metabolic anion gap acidosis. He has been experiencing hypotension, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored. He has also been experiencing nausea and vomiting, and has been receiving anti-nausea medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to AFib with RVR, poor oral intake, and possible sepsis. If left untreated, it may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's AFib with RVR may lead to hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of stroke.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and kidney dysfunction.
4. Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient's DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
5. Metabolic Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's metabolic anion gap acidosis may lead to organ dysfunction and failure if left untreated.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to stress dose steroids, secondary to stress reaction from previous events, or due to developing infection. If left untreated, it may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
9. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue digoxin for rate control and phenylephrine for vasopressor support.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust vasopressor support as needed.
3. Consider starting amiodarone for rate control and conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Consider starting antibiotics for broad-spectrum coverage.
6. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust treatment as needed.
7. Consider starting anticoagulation therapy for DVT prophylaxis.
8. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as needed.
9. Consider starting iron supplements for anemia.
10. Monitor the patient's nausea and vomiting and adjust treatment as needed."

   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 18, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #. Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently
   complaining of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous
   admission. GI recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an
   outpatient esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   #. Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue pantoprazole.
   .
   #. FEN - regular, low Ca, caffeine-free diet
   .
   #. PPX - acyclovir, fluconazole, pantoprazole; bowel regimen prn. On
   treatment doses of enoxaprin for known DVTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has been receiving chemotherapy and has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR. He is currently being treated with digoxin for rate control and phenylephrine for hypotension. He has also been started on vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, but it is likely related to AFib with RVR, poor oral intake, and possible sepsis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has had multiple episodes of AFib with RVR, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of stroke.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient has an upper extremity DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
5. Metabolic Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has a metabolic anion gap acidosis, which can lead to respiratory acidosis, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can lead to increased risk of bleeding and decreased cardiac output.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
8. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient has nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased cardiac output.
9. Back Pain: The patient has back pain, which can lead to decreased mobility, increased risk of falls, and decreased cardiac output.
10. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient has GERD, which can lead to respiratory complications, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: Continue phenylephrine for hypotension and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: Continue digoxin for rate control and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Hypercalcemia: Continue treatment with bisphosphonates and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis: Continue treatment with enoxaparin and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Metabolic Anion Gap Acidosis: Continue treatment with bicarbonate and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Thrombocytopenia: Continue treatment with platelet transfusions and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Anemia: Continue treatment with blood transfusions and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Nausea and Vomiting: Continue treatment with anti-nausea medications and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Back Pain: Continue treatment with pain medications and monitor for signs of improvement.
* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Continue treatment with proton pump inhibitors and monitor for signs of improvement.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment for his various medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve his outcomes."

   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and upper extremity DVT, who is being
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 16, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely in the setting of afib with
   RVR, poor po intake, possible sepsis although no fevers.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - TTE
   - no aline for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: recurrent in the setting of hypovolemia vs
   malignant pericardial effusions vs infection. Converted overnight to
   NSR s/p amiodarone load, IVFs, phenylephrine gtt.
   - rate control w digoxin
   - consider starting po amiodarone in am.
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - Check TTE
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - Telemetry
   - Unable to resite central line to RIJ for now as bedside U/S
   demonstrated thrombus in RIJ vein. If spikes fever and/or develops
   worsening hemodynamics, will need to try to place L SCV line or femoral
   lines if still on pressors. If off of pressors, can try to place PIVs.
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Check TTE to r/o RV strain.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC up to 11K from 5.6 on AM labs. Likely in setting
   of stress dose steroids, possibly secondary to stress reaction from AM
   events, or due to developing infection.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   .
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - AG 16, has been increasing over past
   few days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for
   treatment and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count
   should be kept greater than 50K.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), hypercalcemia, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has a history of chemotherapy, and his current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, enoxaparin, and digoxin. He is also receiving IV fluids, phenylephrine, and metoprolol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 102/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the etiology is unclear. The patient may be at risk for further hypotension, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's AF/RVR is recurrent, and the etiology is unclear. The patient may be at risk for further episodes of AF/RVR, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are elevated, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, and other complications.
4. Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVTs, and his current medications include enoxaparin. The patient may be at risk for further DVTs, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications.
5. Metabolic Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap is increasing, which could lead to metabolic acidosis, organ dysfunction, and failure.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could lead to bleeding complications and increased risk of infection.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could lead to infection and other complications.
8. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust medications as necessary to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within normal ranges.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, including calcium, white blood cell count, and platelet count, and adjust medications as necessary to maintain normal ranges.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and adjust IV fluids as necessary to maintain normal urine output.
4. Consider starting amiodarone to control the patient's atrial fibrillation.
5. Consider starting antibiotics to treat potential infections.
6. Consider starting anticoagulation therapy to prevent further DVTs and pulmonary embolism.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medications as necessary to maintain normal mental status.
8. Consider starting antacid therapy to treat the patient's acidosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M w DLBCL s/p multiple doses of chemotherapy w hospital course c/b
   AF/RVR, hypercalcemia, and RUE DVT, who is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with afib with RVR in the setting of hypotension.
   # Atrial fibrillation w RVR: unclear etiology, possibly in the setting
   of hypovolemia vs malignant pericardial effusions vs infection/sepsis.
   Responded to amiodarone in the past.
   - rate control w digoxin at baseline
   - if unstable, consider phenylephrine bolus vs amiodarone 150mg IV vs
   metoprolol IV if BP tolerates
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - IVF boluses prn to maintain urine output, keep MAPs > 60.
   - f/u bl cxs
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - telemetry
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology, likely combination of poor po intake w
   possible sepsis [**1-20**] infxn (?line infxn), worsened by afib w RVR.
   - vancomycin and cefepime for broad-coverage
   - attempt to wean phenylephrine gtt
   - no a-line for now per pt and wife's wishes.
   # Agitation: intermittently delirious
   - haldol PRN
   # h/o DVTs - Has known h/o bilateral LE DVTs and RUE DVT, s/p IVC
   filter [**2-24**]. On enoxaparin, which was last held on [**5-7**] when plts 20K.
   Possible that pt may have PE given recent afib with RVR, hypotension.
   - Continue enoxaparin at 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
   - Per BMT, would hold enoxaparin if plts < 20K.
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 [**1-20**] Infxn vs steroids.
   - Monitor fever curve.
   - Follow-up bld cxs, UA
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per BMT, because pt requires lovenox for treatment
   and prevention of further DVTs, the patient's platelet count should be
   kept greater than 50K.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse for > 50K.
   .
   # Anemia - Likely related to anemia of chronic disease. Less likely
   that anemia is [**1-20**] chemo nadir at this point as last chemo was 1 month
   ago.
   - Follow Hct, transfuse for less than 24 per BMT.
   - Keep T&S active.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # Metabolic anion gap acidosis - Has been increasing over past few
   days. Likely secondary to lactic acidosis that may be secondary to
   hypoperfusion vs. increased cell death/turnover from recurrent
   lymphoma, although this has not yet been verified by biopsy.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Closely monitor for worsening gap.
   .
   # Nausea - Per BMT note, etiology unclear. Pt not currently complaining
   of this. Evaluated by GI and neurology on previous admission. GI
   recommended continuing with max dose reglan and an outpatient
   esophagael motility study.
   - reglan 2.5 mg PO tid with meals and prn
   - zyprexa 5 mg ODT TID prn
   - IV zofran prn
   .
   # Back pain - Evaluated by pain service on last admission. Not
   currently complaining of back pain. Continue methadone.
   .
   # GERD - Continue pantoprazole.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypotension, and hypercalcemia. He has a history of bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and a right upper extremity DVT, and is currently receiving enoxaparin for prophylaxis. He has also been experiencing agitation, nausea, and back pain, and has been diagnosed with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic anion gap acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 114 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 102/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Central venous pressure: 4 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 11.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 105 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 67 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.09 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 6.4 mmol/L
* LDH: 474 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 94 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 0.6 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's hypercalcemia is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone pain.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as bleeding, petechiae, and ecchymoses.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
6. Metabolic anion gap acidosis: The patient's metabolic anion gap acidosis is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction, shock, and death.
7. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition.
8. Back pain: The patient's back pain is likely to continue, and may lead to further complications such as muscle spasms, decreased mobility, and decreased quality of life.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."
